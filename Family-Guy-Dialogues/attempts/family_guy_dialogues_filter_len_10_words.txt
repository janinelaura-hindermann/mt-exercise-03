Greg, I'm afraid your punishment will be four hours in the snakepit.
That'll give you time to think about what you did.
Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the fire chamber for tattling on your brother.
Smoking. How does a boy like that go so wrong?
Yeah. They got robbers, thugs, drug dealers. You name it.
No, thanks. See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections?
Meg, you don't need to change the way you look.
You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.
You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb.
Don't pout, honey. When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman!
Mark my words, when you least expect it, your uppance will come!
Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion?
Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family.
As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party.
Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads to trouble.
Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church?
And so the Lord God smote poor Job with festering boils all over his body.
Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity.
And then there was that time at the ice cream store.
Remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia?
I got it. That's the guy from Big. Tom Hanks, that's it.
Funny guy, Tom Hanks. Everything he says is a stitch.
Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight.
I feel kind of bad, guys. I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.
Did I bring the porno? You're gonna love it. It's a classic.
Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Not today or tomorrow.
Man. My kid must've taped over this for history class.
Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, Dad.
Kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take her clothes off.
Feels like accountants are cranking adding machines in my head.
That's dangerous thinking, Paul. You best stick to your work.
You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean...
My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly?
Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.
Mr. Weed, I've been working on the new G.I. Jew line.
No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him.
Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here.
It's your job to watch for toys that could be hazardous to kids.
And now back to Action News 5. Our top story tonight, When Toys Attack.
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market.
Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive.
Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections!
Can we put her out in the yard for a while?
Jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois?
If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me!
Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not people like us.
Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right?
When she worries, she says, I told you so and: Stop doing that. I'm asleep. So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?
Not a word to your mom about me getting canned.
I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world.
What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish and nothing else.
It sucks, Brian. I've already been through two jobs this week.
Then I had that job as the sneeze guard for that restaurant's salad bar.
I thought I could win money in that talent show.
And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers!
Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth.
What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right?
That I didn't stand up to a tank in Tiananmen Square?
Screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks!
You can't keep lying to her about losing your job.
I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn.
I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.
Since when are you so concerned about our food budget?
Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but...
Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week.
I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about.
Stewie, I thought I tucked you in an hour ago.
Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny.
It's the best way to keep her from the truth.
You have no choice. Your unemployment will dry up soon.
She'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house.
Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies?
I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30.
Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare.
Come on, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn.
Who would've thought getting drunk would get me $150,000 a week from the government?
Mr. President, why do you think the public supports you during these impeachment proceedings?
Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David?
No. I just rented it. But they're gonna be ticked.
The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car.
The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys.
I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had.
You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen?
It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new.
I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.
But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris?
I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich.
I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids.
Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was for Peter.
Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight.
No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into.
I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter.
The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money!
Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you?
Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers.
But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it.
The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!
Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football!
Amazing. You can barely drive a car. Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?
Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain!
I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.
Man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these.
Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old trying to make amends... ...for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds play.
I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football!
I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true.
You can't hold onto that thing to save your life.
If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married.
Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie.
What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears?
But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.
You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates.
Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades!
I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed?
I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake.
Why are we making a federal case out of this?
Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment?
I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner?
All right. Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass.
Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just...
I don't know. I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve.
I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government.
Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all.
Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times.
But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father.
But what he needs to remember is that we love him.
That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with him!
Intolerable as it may be l'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance.
Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device!
Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgmenly.
It sure was. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: She sells seashells down by the seashore.
What sound does a cow make? Don't toy with me!
I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper. I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest.
It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it?
Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
You can't leave the table until you finish your vegetables.
Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. You've got a good 40 years on me, woman!
Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the airplane.
Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright Brothers!
Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it.
Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die.
I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you.
Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek.
The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Faloppia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.
You've been in front of the TV since you got home from work.
And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing the point of having commercials.
Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me anything.
You may want to find a better teacher than Peter.
Don't believe that. I always keep my eyes on the road.
I don't miss a thing. We now return to Star Trek.
You always want to be aware of other cars on the road.
If you catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him.
I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice.
You forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job.
I didn't want to overload her on her first time out.
So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy!
Or maybe I should arrest you for being too beautiful.
I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy.
And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple.
All I need to do is build a machine to control the global environment.
Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom!
Come on. Let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00.
Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my license.
If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.
Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off?
God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know!
I know how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of disappointments, too.
You just have to remember that life has its little ups and... Jeez!
We're gonna miss the beginning of my show. There it is.
You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town!
I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car.
Come on, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right?
I remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie.
I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter.
I know what I did was wrong. And I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you.
And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle, the sum...
Meg, clean out the shower the next time you shave your legs.
I know. Let's play a little game called Taking the Fall for Daddy.
If you win, I'll buy you a convertible when you get your license.
Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time.
Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.
Think I'll go get drunk and beat up midgets. How about you?
It appears the witless provider has finally brought me something of value.
I can use that crude device to amplify my deadly signal.
If I take the blame, he'll buy me a convertible when I get my license.
Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling everyone.
Isn't bribe just another word for love? You wanted me and Meg to bond.
Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable.
Now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine without TV.
You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey. Remember when you gave up candy?
I'll ask you one more time. You didn't eat anything in my factory?
You think I'm some simp who can't live without TV? Give me a break.
Are you gonna tell me, or am I gonna have to show you my ass?
I ain't saying nothing! All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!
Class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea.
But at that moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends.
But only one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it.
It's been a whole week since I seen a TV show.
I wonder what Scooby and the gang are up to now.
The killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river!  Jinkies! What a mystery!
You're right, Scoob. We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch.
You just need to find something to fill the void that's left in your life.
Lois has knitting, Chris has video games, Meg's learning how to drive.
Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?
Rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall finish them all off!
Last night I woke up and he was channel surfing through static.
Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing your grip on reality.
Boring. I'll go see what else is on. Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.
What's he up to this time? I'm going to work!
We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well.
I never knew anyone who went crazy before except my invisible friend Col. Schwartz!
They're really reaching for guest stars in the 10th season.
I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends?
Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion.
Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch.
That's the guy who ruined our cable. Let's get him!
Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV.
Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.
She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot box.
I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road.
I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil.
I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day long.
You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in your life.
You should spend some time with our kids, Peter. And with me.
I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money.
What a gorgeous day. Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?
It's always a nice day with two scoops of raisins, Peter.
Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my weather control device!
Your mother was right. It'd be a crime to sit around and wait for the TV.
There's a world out there waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs!
I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out.
Wake up! You promised you'd get this hook out of my mouth.
Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family.
Diane, that last report was so good, I think you deserve a spanking.
That frigid old cow lives in Quahog. She can't hear a word I'm saying.
Their puerile minds are once again distracted by that flickering box.
We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival. You know those Germans.
Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the family.
Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV together?
We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go.
But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed.
This is a dangerous mission. And it's likely one of us will be killed.
The landing party will consist of myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.
There's only one show I want to see. It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself.
Come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little?
The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment?
Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together.
No, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.
Come along. I bet you could squeeze into Lois' lederhosen.
If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little...
I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over television.
The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here.
It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's pouring!
I'll teach you how to drive some other time. Pull over.
Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner.
Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast, I'll do enough living for me and Bill.
Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be?
There's a big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill.
TV took over my life once. I'm never gonna let that happen again.
If you help me out of here, I know a meadow where the blueberries are begging to be picked.
Look, buddy. Just go in the pan. And don't call me unless you're flatlining.
Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test can I still get a convertible?
No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart.
And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson.
It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life it's who you do it with, and your family...
I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your father.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin. Would you like to see?
Yeah, I've never actually seen a baby being... Oh, God!
I confirmed everything with the birthday party planner at Cheesie Charlie's.
They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters!
Why can't we have the same kind of party we always do?
When Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything.
Thanks to Cheesie Charlie I'm not gonna miss a moment of Stewie's party.
I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces?
Hey, Stinky. Have we got some big plans for you.
I've hired a professional to make sure everything goes just right.
God, I hate high school. I don't fit in with anyone.
I thought we were gonna rumble with those greasy Sharks.
Not without seven years of ballet and two of jazz tap, we're not.
From the top, people! Why don't you just hang back and stretch?
The more I try to make friends, the more people hate me.
Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl with a mind of her own.
I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be.
I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house.
I wasn't just blowing smoke when I bought this T-shirt.
I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt. Dear Diary... It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated  in that amniotic Attica. As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity  I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months.
Day 171. I've sprouted another finger, counting the one from yesterday.
I'm up to 11. As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white!
He must be the hired professional of whom they spoke.
He failed to thwart my escape into the outside world.
And now, one year hence, he's returning to rectify his mistake and put me back in the womb!
My God. Your hair is so beautiful. I just want to brush it.
Now your mom is counting on us to drop off the deposit.
Come on, move it! Oh, man! Chris, this place is great.
Hey, Dad, they even got games in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon!
All right. I won a watch. What's The Dukes of Hazzard?
Folks in Hazzard County hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time.
Them boys rassled for a full five minutes before the manager stepped in.
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I got a deposit check for my kid's party right here.
Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.
Wait. I was just bluffing. My wife has her heart set on this place.
Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house.
Because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me.
So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he?
If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces.
Here we are. Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries.
Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good. See, it happened like this.
I was sent by my smart, beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.
And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize.
They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.
Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives.
Please don't make me angry, pal. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
Do you know how hard it was to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's?
I had to book it the day of my ultrasound.
Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home.
I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piata, the works!
Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here.
You're gonna have a tough time finding a... Hold on.
I've got an army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua.
I require a window seat and an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles!
Hey there, little fella. Why don't you come with me?
Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She gave me a ride home.
Meg, you didn't tell me your mother was just like Martha Stewart.
Oh, no. Once you get to know me, I'm really very nice.
You know what's nice? Having a friend like Meg. And kittens.
It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever.
Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday.
Meg, our entire family is going to be here for Stewie's party.
I can't believe you'd put your family before your own daughter!
I'm looking for a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday.
Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand, and some somersaults maybe.
I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web.
The only way you'll get me to talk is through slow, painful torture.
It sounds like you don't want to go home. Are you running away?
And part of growing up means facing your problems head on.
The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie the clarity of your wisdom.
You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it.
As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!
If you pull a party out of your ass, you'll want to stand up.
My friend Jennifer invited me to hang out with her friends.
I won't fall for this trick. Did you ask your mother?
The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piata.
Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father, a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser.
The circus is in town. Maybe you could run away and join it.
Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope.
Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.
Peter, this is the most wonderful celebration I could have imagined.
I'll get him. If you see Meg, tell her to take plenty of pictures.
I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?
What's the big deal? So Meg's with her new friends.
I'm glad you could join us. We're gonna have a great time on our trip.
A trip? Like to the beach? Because I didn't bring my swimsuit.
Yes. But no sprinkles! For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!
Come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset.
I mean, a party couldn't be any better if Jesus himself showed up.
Okay, everybody. For my next miracle, I'm gonna turn water into funk.
Peter, the circus is terrific. But it's not just Stewie's birthday.
I know. It's just that I really like that guy over there.
But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog.
There. Now, if I can just find a midget with some gin, I'll be in business.
I gotta make things right for Lois and get this monkey off my back.
All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb.
Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you or you!
I offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle.
I know that for some of you, your motor skills are not developed.
But your children's children will know that you fell for a noble cause.
I'll defend myself, and the hell with all of you!
There, I've gone and soiled myself. Are you happy now?
Our leader is here to take us on our journey!
My children, rejoice. The hour of transformation is close at hand.
This is Meg, wise one. Can she come with us?
Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity?
Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity?
Great! Then all you need is a dark-blue jogging suit.
Dad, what are you doing here? I'm so embarrassed, I could die!
It's just Stewie's birthday. So what if I'm not there?
In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born.
Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie.
With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants.
And, Meg, today she wants you to be with the family.
No you're not, honey. What about that fat girl from the Judds?
It's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you.
For the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before?
That would just make me some kind of lone nut.
The guy who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic.
And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.
I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death.
Stewie, make a wish. If you blow out the candle, it'll come true.
That's right, little buddy. What do you want most in the whole world?
When life is getting to you put some fresh in your life Let Mintos freshen up your life Life is just a breeze when you stay fresh and cool Because Mintos puts the fresh in life Taste that freshness Just can't beat it Mintos freshness Let Mintos freshen your life
Must kill Lincoln. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
You're just teething, Stewie. It's a normal part of a baby's life.
Very well then, I order you to kill me at once!
But Mommy has to clean up the house, all right?
For the love of God, shake me! Shake me like a British nanny!
Oh, man. This is the life. Hand me another one of them Pawtucket Patriots.
Guys, I want to say a toast to you, Quagmire, Cleveland...
Yeah. If you guys were beers, I would drink every one of you.
That's funny. That's even more humorous than that joke you told us last night.
Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar, right?
Jewish guy and a Chinese guy walk into a bar.
I promised Loretta I was gonna trim the hedges and be tender with her.
Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need some time off as much as we do.
This is when Lois does all those little things that women like to do.
You've been busy all day. So I took care of dinner.
All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it.
And in five seconds, you turn it into low tide at the pier.
Jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up.
All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game?
Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing around.
Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home.
I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
I'd like to hang around with you. But Lois needs me at home.
That was good, Reuben. Now play Brahms' Lullaby. Lullaby and good night
Enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours!
I wish I could make the pain go away sooner.
Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine.
Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.
Get Moby Dick off the field before he burps up a license plate!
Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead stinking blue cheese feta!
I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under house arrest.
Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about the other times I broke the law.
And there was that time I took a whiz in public.
I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move.
Thanks, honey. But I don't know how you stand it here all day.
I mean, I'm so bored, I can't even watch TV anymore.
This contains adult content and is brought to you by the letter H.
Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's.
Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed!
All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you.
Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them.
Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. Lois and the family sitting in a tree
Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic dinner?
Like when we were dating. That oughta take your mind off the guys.
Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came down to get some beers.
Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well.
If I walk through you, does that mean, like, we've done it?
Where the hell have you been? We had a date.
What do you say? You think the guys will like it?
This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends?
Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen.
You know those little clam cakes you make whenever we have company? I need about a dozen.
And I'm through taking care of you and your bar buddies!
One can only imagine what foul regions that finger has erstwhile probed!
My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a toothache.
Words cannot express the depth of my appreciation and love for you.
No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty.
You see, Misty my time manipulator employs axioms from the quantum theory of molecular propulsion.
Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo?
Meg, take Stewie upstairs. Show me the way to go home Everybody! I'm tired and I want to go to bed Just the women!
Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I...
It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but... Never mind.
That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do!
I haven't even told you the other reason your piano's down here.
Like it was an instrument. I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?
Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks. You'll never know just how much I love you You'll never know just how much I care
Yeah! And if I try, I still couldn't hide my love for you You oughta know for haven't I told you so?
All right! If there is some other way to prove that I love you I swear I don't know how
Nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife. You'll never know if you don't know now
The second that spotlight hit me, I became a whole different person!
I must complete my time machine, move time forward, and end this agony!
Yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being polite.
Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight. Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for You know you got the brand of kisses that I die for
That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee! You know you made me love you
Let me finish the story, fellas. You don't want to be up all night.
My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys.
Now that I'm a free man, we can do anything we want.
If Lois were my woman, I'd keep an eye on her.
If I wanted to marry Lola Falana, I would have.
Look, Lola. This whole thing is just going way too fast for me.
For the last time, I'm not Lola! I'm Leslie Uggams!
Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place.
I built that thing so my friends would come to see me, not you.
Thanks to your wife my husband hasn't been home all week!
Come to my basement tonight and drag your husbands out of there.
This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband, Peter.
Hit it! Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta If someone takes a spill it's me and not you Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
No! It's a... Blast, what the devil do children draw?
A time machine. Sure. Here's where the flux capacitor goes.
I can't wait to build one of these of my own.
I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans.
Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night.
Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? It's got steam heat I got steam heat But I need your love to keep away the cold I got...
Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men!
Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers.
No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special.
I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house.
Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices when I get my hair done.
Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons. I'm gonna go grab some ozone.
They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security!
Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.
Lois, you make it sound like I don't appreciate you at all.
Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me?
At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment. There.
Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.
Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say I love you every day.
And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson.
Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home.
I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself.
Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies.
How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind.
God. The more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away!
A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham.
I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies!
Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game.
Don't forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties.
More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H.
When Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy?
This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon Guillermo.
I hired Guillermo because I believe he'll be an asset to our company on and off the field.
I'm sure I can find a position for you somewhere.
Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures.
Cute as a button fat as a cow radioactive scorpion. Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.
I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park.
Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. Go tuck yourself in.
Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, My hairy aunt.
Practice? I thought we'd go next door and welcome our new neighbors.
Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.
If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it.
Peter, they might be very nice people. Very nice people.  Yeah, that's what they always say.
Then you open up the septic tank and... Skeleton city!
Don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands.
Unfortunately Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor.
Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch.
I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity.
Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel!
Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired!
Man. What'll I do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.
What was the name of the bad guy from Tron?
Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence.
But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move.
Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic!
Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.
I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar.
Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo?
One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.
She wants you to meet them. She's always making me be social.
Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.
What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference.
You got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too.
I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?
Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver.
Before you know it, you're using my supermarket my dry cleaner, and even my postman.
Can you believe that guy? Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?
Gosh, I'd like to help. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on my ass for five minutes.
Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday.
See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first.
Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college.
This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me.
See I have that disease where stuff pops out of your mouth.
I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.
Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you?
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again.
No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do?
They play on their neighbor's company softball team like this Saturday.
So much fun it should be illegal like copyright infringement.
If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them at home.
He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action.
Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic?
Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on.
I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
Crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe!
Why with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans!
Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe!
That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe.
Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket.
Hey, look! I fell in the pool with my clothes on!
How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys?
Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys, you know to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!
That's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble.
What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug.
Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company.
Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job.
About 10 years ago I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage.
It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen.
All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. You think you have won You think all is well But kiss my green ass I shall see you in hell!
If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably I shall take the information from you by force!
Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.
What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.
Well, technically he was killed by the state, but funny story.
Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe?
You don't admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them.
He's a remarkable man and the rest of your family adores him!
And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this.
Hey, look at me. I'm walking. I'm a remarkable man.
I thought you were gonna spend all night at Joe's.
Forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop.
My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on.
It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero. He makes the world a better place.
Remember the time I sang to the kids at the Sunday school?
Yes, you forgot the words. Jesus loves me He loves me a bunch Because He always puts Skippy In my lunch
No. It's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger every day.
Unless I put myself in real danger, too! For my family's sake!
Gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.
Is it me or is rap music just getting lazier?
This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime.
All units! A major robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust.
They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave!
You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
This was her first robbery and she was very brave.
Because there's a five-year sleepover at the big house. And you're invited.
Lois and the kids should be in here to see this.
Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?
Have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer?
If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys.
If you want to be a hero, now might be a good time.
I thought being a hero would be all fun and games.
Sorry, Wonder Woman. I got three kings. Now let's see your pair.
All right. Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her.
Actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell.
Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife.
Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner.
All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy.
Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms.
Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero.
This wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and...
He's wearing a white-collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses.
I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company.
So if anyone's gonna bust me, I'm glad it's you.
A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation.
If we want the cops to take us seriously, we have to waste a hostage. But who?
This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out.
Not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible.
I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours.
This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life.
Yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved.
But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to?
But I do anyway because I am not a robot!
And even though society has turned its back on you I promise you there are people who care.
Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera?
Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go!
Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter.
There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second.
One day I shall unlock the secret of that device.
Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove?
I guess I was just tired of him being your hero.
Peter, Joe is a hero. But he's not our hero.
You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset.
Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it.
Yeah, Daddy. If you hadn't pulled this stunt I wouldn't know how to manipulate Kevin.
And when the kids at school see us on TV they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, That psycho is my dad!
I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano, had you not driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a. m.
I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys.
It's also about just being there for the people you love.
She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. l shall give her a piece of my mind!
Evidently, madam, you and l differ greatly in our conception of beauty.
What l just witnessed was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!
Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. ln fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.
How dare you fill my head with such loathsome propaganda?
You know the tub where you take your little baths?
What in the name of our Christian God? You're out of the semicircle!
Ladies, this Saturday at 0800 there will be a soapbox derby as a reward for all your obedience.
Anything on that remote lower than mute? l got a surprise for you, Chris. lt'll have to wait. This is where the Fonz goes....
Chris, this is the speed machine that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.
But, Dad, l was supposed to build it myself. lt's a rule.
Dad, what would you say if l told you l didn't want to be in the Scouts? l'd say come again? And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.''
But thank God that's not the case. You're a Scout.
And you know what that means? That means l love you.
Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room. l thought that was just when you were asleep.
What do you want? l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. l just want to draw. l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke.
Tell him yourself. l can't. l don't want to disappoint him again.
You remember when he tried to sneak me into the County Fair?
Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't talk! No!
Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter.
Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And l.... Wait a minute.
Chris, l am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again.
Very well. But l am not really your father! Ha-ha!
Do not go until l wave my flag. l can't stress that enough. l'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.
Your idiot son hasn't earned a single merit badge. lf you'll excuse me, l've got to administer some spankings.
All right! You've got three days to earn a badge!
Jell-O. How exotic! l feel like l'm on the deck of the QE II.
We've only got one more night to get that badge.
Dad, maybe we should just give up. l mean, we tried everything.
But what l can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table.
Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore? l think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together.
But he's the one who should be earning that badge.
Where do you get off telling me how to raise my son?
What? Those bastards! Don't you worry. l'll get you back in! lt's okay, Dad. l'm not really--
Don't take no for an answer, Chris. You're a Griffin.
Clear! l'm calling that troop leader. We're going over his head.
Pack your bags, you guys! The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!
Ha-ha! Did you hear? The Griffins are going to New York!
This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha! l can't believe we're going to New York.
Yes, l do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts.
That's the best you can do, you dull-witted termagant? l brought your Raffi tape.
Play WheeIs on the Bus and get the hell out of my sight.
No, thanks. l've been to New York. lt's like Prague sans the whimsy.
Will you be okay by yourself?. l think l'll manage.
After years of study, I've discovered the secret to Ionger Iife in canines.
We interrupt this program for some episodes of One Day at a Time.
Damn it, JuIie. I'm a singIe mother doing the best damn job she knows how!
I asked you to fix that damn sink two days ago!
And by that I mean I'II have sex with you.
And by ''reproductive organ, '' I mean the thing between your knees.
We are not lost. And even if we were l can't ask a human being for directions.
No way. We came to get you back into the Scouts.
Are you okay? l'll be fine. l just have to concentrate on driving.
FeeI free to visit gift shop in Iobby and restaurant on second fIoor.
This is gonna be a photo finish, Lois! l'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie.
Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to New York?
We're trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and defiled our women.
Thank you. Yes. And what's the deal with airline food?
Over there. l didn't know you knew how to play poker.
Yeah. lt's funny. l never knew video poker could be so much fun.
You win a few hands and all those lights go off.
Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it. lt felt so good. l kept putting my money in.
And before l knew it, l'd lost $40. l'm so embarrassed.
That's okay. As long as you learned your lesson. l did, Peter, for a couple of minutes. Then....
This is so silly. l started playing again. l could swear l parked here.
Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. l sort of bet our car. l won't panic. l need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife.
Nice going, Mom. l finally get my driver's license and you lose the car to a poker machine.
Don't talk about your mother that way. She is not an iron.
We gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris back into the Scouts.
But Dad-- l got it. l'll just get Brian to wire us some money.
Damn it, JuIie! I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.
No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you? l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish. lt just seemed like such a good cause.
Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits.
That's it! Let's go! l'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.
But we're not allowed to return gambling losses. l think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too.
And that entitles me to a share of your wampum, kemosabe.
Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past. l come from a long line of you people.
My great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. l mean, Chief Grand Cherokee. He was a rainmaker.
And he also killed a bunch of Krauts at Wounded Knee.
So are you gonna give me back my car, or what? l have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait here.
Are you nuts, Peter? You'll never get away with this.
There is no way they're gonna believe you're an lndian.
Like a really impossible stunt to prove he's the real deal.
To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest.
Of course l do. l'm an lndian. But why don't you explain it to my wife?
Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water.
He must remain there until he can communicate with nature.
He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and trees.
And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth.
LOlS: Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. l'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.
Come on. All l gotta do is have a spiritual vision. l've had one before.
Oh, my God, Brian. There's a message in my Alpha Bits. lt says ''Ooooo.''
Now get the hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision.
CHRlS: Dad, l'm hungry. Are we gonna die? Of course not.
This isn't the first time l found my own food in the wild.
How long do these vision quests usually take? lt varies. lt depends on the person's age, and height, and sign.
Why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies?
Yeah. l guess. Oh, my God! l'm communicating with nature!
Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a noise?
But would any of you take the time to help me? l'm playing the world's smallest violin, Scott.
Shouldn't you be in the middle of a Tuscadero sandwich?
Yeah. But l'm your spiritual guide, see? l want to lay a little personal truth on you.
And Griffin, right now, your son needs you to listen to him. Whoa!
There's something l always wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.
Sure. Go right ahead. l don't want to be a Scout, Dad. l just don't have fun there.
Son, why don't you just stick a knife in my heart?
Not all of them. Some of these look pretty good.
Yeah! l didn't know anyone in this family had any talent.
No. She.... Yeah. l probably don't say this often enough.
''And the cat's in the cradle with the silver spoon
''But we'll get together then, son You know we'll have a--''
Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision? lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees. And l saw the Fonz.
Really? What's the Fonz like? l bet he's stuck up.
A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer. l want a spiritual vision, too! Man! l guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. l mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity.
All right! We did it! Let's get the hell out of here.
But most Native Americans are proud hardworking people who are true to their spiritual heritage.
Just this morning you said they were lazy like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.
The Mexicans are a clean and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage.
Actually, the Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall.
And did you know that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel?
The Eight is Enough reunion show is about to start.
Yeah. He's still upset because Abby threw out his baseball cards.
You know, I love you girls. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses will make a serviceable parachute should I need to abandon my jet in mid-flight.
There! See what you made me do? Do you think I enjoy hitting you?
Actually, I do. I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again!
Stewie! My clothes are not for you to play with, understand?
I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.
You prance about this house like the cock of the walk.
But will you be prancing when there's nothing to prance about?
You! You seem to know all the players in this poorly-acted farce.
Meg! You vile-smelling girl, you're not to touch any of my things!
Meanwhile, here at home Quahog remains in the sweltering grip of a freak heat wave.
We're even feeling the effects of this heat wave here in our studio.
Am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?
Fetch me something linen to throw on before I call Child Services!
The Rhode Island Dog Show Championship is in Quahog this year!
If you won, we could use that money for a new air conditioner.
You could do your impression of a barbershop quartet. We were sailing along On Moonlight Bay We could hear the voices singing They seemed to say
Sorry. I don't do dog shows. It's not my thing.
Come on. All you gotta do is a few simple commands.
And maybe a trick or two. It'll be like taking candy from a baby.
I don't know. I mean I don't even know where my papers are.
I've been trying. That's why I went on that game show.
For $800, this chemical dye is found in over 95% of all cosmetic products.
Come on, Brian. We really need a new air conditioner.
I'm already shvitzing like crazy here. Let's call it a night.
We haven't even talked about how you'll wear your ears.
Lois, honey, I love you but you're sucking all the energy out of the room.
I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs whenever you're ready.
Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. ...almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.
Not drugs. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to help them perform.
Lois, if Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is.
Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle! It's time to make life a cabaret!
Lady, for God's sake, I'm just a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!
I'll give you a shiny dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.
Let me see if I can find you a juice box.
This? This is the part where you beg for a treat.
Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car!
Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.
I let you down? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the good dog?
This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for us.
This and not do that thing where you drag your ass across the carpet.
Let's just have a nice family car ride like we always do.
I would really feel better if I got your information.
If you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something so degrading.
The next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand?
I was just out for a little walk. That's all.
I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on the sidewalk. Down!
I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning?
Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good.
The fine is $10. You behave, little fella, you hear me?
He's the law outside this house just like I'm the law inside this house.
Big man, can't even afford to buy an air conditioner for your family.
It sure has. You know what they say, If you don't like... ...the weather in New England, go back where you came from.
I guess I had too many bloody marys this morning. But anyway...
I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning.
These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite.
I could've sworn his favorite was treat Peter like crap buns.
My, your summer coat is really coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?
Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra.
I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross.
May I have one on a plate or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose?
Can't you two go back to the way you used to be?
We can't go back to the way things were after how I was treated.
Get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have it here?
Look, you got everything you could possibly want right here.
Now just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog.
What? That. Yeah. I'll clean that up on my way out.
Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that parking meter?
That was Brian's favorite commercial. Brian? No, it's not ringing a bell.
You heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family.
That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak!
We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will feel a lot better.
Don't do that. That's what they expect you to do.
And your puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here?
Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts.
Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new pet.
Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed in the bus station.
You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I need him.
Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze?
Why don't you make something of your life, like this dog?
You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay, I'm a crazy animal!
I'll get us the best help there is. Dear MacGuyver... Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking straw. Please save my dog.
Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal.
I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is.
Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case!
You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance after all.
We're family. This is what we do for each other.
This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin.
Yes, he is man's best friend. But what manner of friend is man?
I would like to cite the case of Plessy v. Ferguson...
Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog?
Look, all Brian's ever wanted is the same respect he gives us.
And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the oodmay but Brian won't amscray.
Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second.
But the law is the law and can't be circumvented by pretty words.
Jessica Fletcher! Why I haven't seen you since you had the...
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself.
When you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered in flies with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston!
Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend!
I haven't even told your father that Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Because if it wasn't for her, I never would've met you, Peter.
Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you.
My name is Peter. I'll be your nipples... Towel boy!
What if they bury her and she wakes up because she wasn't really dead she was only sleeping?
Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm.
Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari.
He won't rest until he kills something on every continent.
But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas.
Would you be a sport and fetch it for me?
These bluebeards still treat me like scum 'cause I'm not loaded.
I got news for them. I'm as elegant as anyone in this room.
What did we get? Come on, big money! No whammy! Stop!
Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you.
Newport, Rhode Island home of New England's most elegant and historic estates the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt.
Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else.
I just knew you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true.
That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport.
Now I feel bad for doing that thing with her toothbrush. We only live to kiss your ass
Kiss it? We'll even wipe it for you. From here on in, it's Easy Street
Can I see that pamphlet, sir? My God, this house is freakin' sweet I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch each and every day Chocolate cake  la Blake Hundred bucks, Blake is gay We'll do the best we can with Meg
It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now. We'll do your nails and rub your feet
That's not necessary. Oh, my. We'll do your homework every night
That's why we got that Steven Hawking guy. My God, this house is freakin' sweet I used to pass lots of gas Lois ran away Now we've got 30 rooms Hello, beans, good-bye, spray We'd take a bullet just for you
Stewie! Prepare to suck that golden teat Now that you're stinking rich we'll gladly be your bitch My God, this house is freakin' sweet
That's a wrap, people. Let's get the hell out of here.
The old bag only paid us up through the song.
It's time you started living like the Piece of Schmidt you are.
Peter, where are we gonna get the money to pay all these people?
Whoops. I recognize that tone Tonight I sleep alone But still, this house is freakin' sweet
Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking me?
Honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and nice stuff.
But I love our old house. You have to buy it back.
Sure, this house is big, but it's also very intimate.
The solarium is at the far end of the west wing.
Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever.
Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy.
Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room.
We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles.
I did love spending time here when I was a kid.
Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the world.
A guy's on his boat, in the middle of the ocean and he sees a little black dog.
This dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like a dead otter.
The freakin' vet tells him, get this, It's not a dog. It's a rat.
Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat.
Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story.
Like the time my buddy's sister's boss was drinking with a hooker in a Vegas bar.
I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club.
I barely had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.
Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing.
Lois' friend yacht boy and his lovely wife Caca invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again.
You gotta help me. Teach me how to be a gentleman.
Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation.
For example, It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having.
After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex.
But just for the heck of it, let's try again.
To tell you the truth, we're all a little uncomfortable being waited on.
If you question me again, I'll put you on diaper detail.
And I promise, I won't make it easy for you!
Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful campus.
Filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich one.
You should marry someone you love. That's what I did.
And he got us kicked out of the yacht club.
You can't be mad at your father for being himself.
That's the reason I fell in love with him in the first place.
Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard l'm gonna carry you off into the sunset on a white horse.
It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur.
Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its own riches.
Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock therapy but your progress has been...
Now the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The right TV has Ricki Lake.
If you so much as glance at the right TV, I'm giving you 10,000 volts.
You're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa.
Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having no penis!
Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction?
We've got a long road ahead. But I've worked miracles before.
Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago.
Maybe he's fitting in so well, we can't tell him from the other bluebloods.
Vodka stinger with a whiskey back. And step on it!
You must join us tomorrow for a game of baccarat.
He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger.
It would look smashing in Lois's crapper. I mean crapier.
Any woman would love to have that vase adorn her crapier.
To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million! Money, money, money
Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist.
If that's French for Star Wars collectors glasses, then si.
Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted Turner.
I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can appreciate.
I'll have the money wired to me from my Swiss bank account.
My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret in case things don't work out.
I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me out?
We're moving back to Quahog as soon as we can get packed.
If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor people with a stick!
You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for Stewie's new friends.
The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste.
You can't become a bloody fiscal hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction!
I wish we'd never come here in the first place.
Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City he saw that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader.
It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace that he was able to see the error of his ways.
I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million vase.
A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front gate.
If I welsh on that debt, I'm gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois.
Good game, Mean Joe. You want some of my Coke?
I could give him the house and call it even.
Brian, it's the Historical Society. We just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here.
So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born.
Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here.
You can't take a step in this house without uncovering something historical.
I happen to know that nothing of historical significance ever occurred here.
Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at Fraggle Rock!
If you get tired of being a snob, look us up.
Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy.
Our beautiful home with the stolen cable and the man with the penis for a light switch.
Your Aunt Marguerite is laughing at me while she's burning in Hell may she rest in peace.
Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is that I love you.
And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would all make this face.
Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back.
Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they paid.
I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction of my own.
Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back and I learned a valuable lesson.
It doesn't matter if your family doesn't think I'm good enough for you.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Mrs. Lipstein, I have bad news. The tumor is malignant.
Is he the one that smells like firewood and has big gray pussywillows in his ears?
My dad worked at that mill for 60 years. That's almost 80 years.
Tomorrow we'll all go to a big dinner to honor him.
Kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the fact that I'm not Catholic.
Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working to show it.
First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad.
Now that he's retiring, we can finally spend some time together.
I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on TV.
Can you do that fluttery thing like when the Brady kids run down the stairs?
Mom, I can't eat. I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.
But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.
At mass this morning it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again.
But in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a hard-working old man to retire.
So you can take this shiny watch and shove it.
Yeah. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it.
Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.
It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.
Now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us.
You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all.
Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies.
Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me. So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell... ...where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever.
Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.
I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass.
I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me?
I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know.
That one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.
You might want to give that a minute or two.
I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin!
If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell!
It'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your heart with leprosy.
I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!
Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad?
Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years.
Why does that man drop his club before he runs around?
Nothing says, Please talk to me, Daddy, like a Fenway frank.
Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore.
Well, la-de-da. I don't need my food brought to me.
I'm not a broken-down old mule! I can still work!
He just left without saying anything? Where would he go?
I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.
Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope.
That's right, Diane. I'll tell you what else will be examined, this cock.
The Rhode Island Cock Society is sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why the suggestive name.
That renegade pirate ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!
It seems he broke into the old mill after hours.
Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill?
Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!
I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You know what killed it? Talkie pictures.
But you can still make it. You just need a gimmick.
I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my round-off.
Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue.
I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male bonding.
It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own.
I hate to say this but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you.
What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy?
We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines.
That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me.
Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich.
Or you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory.
Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich.
And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station.
I assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter.
You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls?
It's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.
Any of you kids want to see a dead body?
Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad.
Your father? He must be a man of at least 70.
Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate.
At 2:00 a.m. Last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom.
Because this man always put his job before everything else.
I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman.
Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son.
Hey! Break up the sewing circle and get back to work!
I say, you won't find that in Winnie the Pooh.
Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel.
Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin.
I'm not sure how that came up exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer.
I'm working triple shifts, and I'm still not Employee of the Week.
This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the zone.
Back to work, all of you! What's going on here?
Dad, some of the guys think that since you took over, work is no fun.
That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a worker and as a father!
At least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working!
I'm a damn good father, and that's more than I can say about you!
Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment.
Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold enough.
I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken.
I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin' down and has a talk with his unemployed son.
If he needs to talk he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings!
How can you just sit there and let him talk like that?
Even my own dad doesn't love me. Face it. I'm going to Hell.
I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity.
Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand a very devoted son.
That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming from you.
We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down.
Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness, the Pope!
Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says Jebus.
The last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.
I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve.
I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn.
Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew.
It's good you missed me. I'm to drive the Popemobile.
Any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours.
I always wake up fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.
Please, go into the living room and make yourself at home!
Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.
Come on. What about the time I was on that airplane?
Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. I was hoping you could change his mind.
No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father.
Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age to like boys.
And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God.
And Kristy McNichol, come back to television. We miss you.
Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.
Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with your...
You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a fine son.
His zest for life is an affirmation of God's great love within us all.
Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good!
Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me.
I just don't like you. I don't like anything about you!
Keep playing. I think this is as good as it gets.
Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell.
Well, in that case, Dad l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.
Take back your job, and give your old man a hug.
I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me.
I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour.
You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is?
I have to. As you said, Peter, I am the freakin' Pope.
No flash photography, or you'll go straight to Hell! You!
Take that cap off before I take it off for you!
But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time.
Guess who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend?
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
That concludes our special half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.
We leave you with a look back at some of those we've lost this millennium.
Kevin asked me to Quagmire's millennium party. I am so psyched.
Well, looks like someone's going to a big party tonight.
You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.
Look, pal, I don't take coupons from giant chickens. Not after last time.
Oh, yeah, and that nice chicken outside gave me this coupon.
Haven't you heard? At midnight, every computer in the world is gonna fail.
Planes will fall out of the sky and all the world's nuclear weapons will explode,
Damned long ears, tryin' to take Easter away from Jesus. What were you sayin'?
Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for party over here!
Forget the party. The world's gonna end. Y2K. I heard it from a chicken-man.
Laugh, but when you die, you'll have to go to heaven.
And you know what? I bet you run into those two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court.
And you won't know which one is which. And it'll be really awkward. So bite me.
There's a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and... well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.
Yes, yes, I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my ass look big?
Peter, come on. You've had 1,000 years to get ready for this party.
Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet?
Oh, crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change.
Peter, you've been down there all day. I hope they're already...
Oh, my God! The government is here. Run, ET, run!
The end of the world is comin'. Get in your radiation suits.
We are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event because of some wacko doomsday theory.
OK, OK. You know that one Christmas present you really wanted, but didn't get?
Yeah, well, it's in the basement. Come on, let's go see.
What the hell...? Peter, if you wanna stay here, that's fine.
Oh, dear me. Yes, yes, this is how I wanted to enter the new millennium.
Locked in a basement with imbeciles, dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.
Thanks a lot. Right now I could be in Boston, pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.
Make him work for it. And shame on you, Peter.
You said nuclear. It's nukular, dumb idiot. The S is silent.
We now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us?
Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about to descend and usher in a new millennium.
Come on, kids, we can still make the party if we...
Now that you mention it, the Y is a bit misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.
Good morning, family. Hey, Lois, remember when I was the third Hardy Boy?
OK, we were wrong about the end of the world and you were right.
I finally get a date with Kevin, and he gets vaporised.
Let's just be grateful we survived the apocalypse healthy and mutation-free.
Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together.
Well, we just finished off what was left in the kitchen.
When I think back on all the food we've wasted in this house.
Thank goodness Peter bought a huge supply of dehydrated meals before the blast.
Peter, whaddaya doin'? You just ate a year's worth of food.
Well, so much for finding food at the Stop 'N Shop.
It figures. The one time I remember my value-club card.
Delicious, Tom. I guess we should be eating her with chopsticks.
That's crazy. They're just gonna be hungry again in an hour.
Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed. I'll take care of Woody, son.
If there's no food in Quahog, why should there be food anywhere else?
Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nukular holocaust: cockroaches and Twinkees. And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.
It was difficult for Twink to play with other children.
He had no bones,  and he couldn't really play any sports.
He's spend hours in the back yard playing Wonder Woman.
We gotta get to that factory and we'll have all the food we need.
Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?
I am Jorad. I and my band of highway warriors control this territory.
Then you may not pass until you answer the following question:
A Twinkee factory that might not even exist any more?
Yep. Just sits there all night and day, singin' about what he sees.
Please, Chris, Mommy's got a very big headache. Stop it!
Thank you, sweetie. Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food.
We've followed the pied piper to the gates of oblivion and look what it's brought us.
We can settle down here and build a house just like we had in Quahog.
Yeah, and we can build a mall so I have a place to hang out.
And two Denny's, so we can say Let's not go to that one. Let's go to the good one.
We can dig Joe out of the driveway and we can build a community just like the one we had.
No, we'll build a better one. I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog.
Yeah, I fold. Hey, come on. Let's go home and get tender with your wife.
I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy.
Excuse me, Mr Mayor. We have an outsider who wishes to join our community.
If you wanna become a citizen, you have to get a job.
On Tuesdays you get to wave your penis at traffic.
Peter, no offence, but that's because we all pitched in.
But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a year.
We have everything we need. And no crime, no guns, no pollution.
And when that trouble happens, we'll blow its freaking head off.
Without guns, how would our forefathers have settled their differences?
And look, it has a little trap door for when you gotta make inky.
I'll have your father flood the basement, so you can get more exercise.
Yes, yes. I do seem to have gained a bit of girth.
There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg.
That wasn't so bad. I don't know what these women are always complaining about.
A chicken in every pot and a cap in every ass.
Put that away. Where did you get the metal for all those guns?
I have a canker sore on my lip, and I keep pokin' at it with my tongue,
I'm the one who knew the world was gonna end and found the Twinkee factory.
I haven't been thrown outta any place since I was a counsellor at the bulimia clinic.
Aw, man. Did anybody else throw up after eatin' that fish last night?
You remember the other day you were asking me what the definition of irony was?
Honey, I'm sorry I got us kicked outta New Quahog.
I guess nobody really needs guns. I'm not always right after all.
Oh, Peter, hearing you say that almost makes it worth havin' the world blown up.
All right! Fudgie the Whale, and Cookie Puss, and Cookie O'Puss, and Nutty the Chocolate Ghost.
I dreamt I saw the strangest episode of Family Guy, and there was a giant chicken and Stewie was an octopus.
And now, Mr Rogers - Fred. May as well drop the bloody formalities.
But now it's time for you to meet Mr Death.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
For 45 minutes I was out there screaming.  I know that cos my damn watch is broken!
It looks like Stewie had an accident on the carpet.
That baby just does not wanna keep his diaper on.
Oh, is that what it is? Really? I could have sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food.
Next time you're shopping, why not splurge on a tin of solid white albacore?
Stewie, are you upset because you went wee-wee on the carpet?
Peter, we have a serious problem we need to discuss.
Oh, jeez. This isn't another one of those interventions, is it?
Peter, you've been wearing that giant foam cowboy hat for eight months now.
Hey, I can take this hat off any time I want. I just don't want to.
How dare you sully my good name by spreading slanderous filth!
Well! The outrages I have suffered today will not be soon forgotten.
Isn't he too young? You know what happened to the Lindbergh baby.
God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake.
Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.
This could be a nice way for you and Stewie to bond.
Oh, God. Not again, Brian. Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet?
Remember, to help control the pet population,  have your pets spayed or neutered.
Princess, I don't see anyone dabbing yours behind their ears.
It looks like someone already tried to clean it up.
We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.
Then you want You're a Naughty Child and That's Concentrated Evil Coming Out the Back of You.
They were so itchy I couldn't sleep, which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if I was OK and I said I couldn't sleep.
Come on, Stewie. Don't you wanna pee in the toilet bowl like a big boy?
I remember when I learned to use a potty all by myself.
Well, perhaps I could give it the old college try.
Maybe you don't have to pee. I oughta just give you some beer. Goes right through you.
Wonderful. And while we're at it, we can light up a doobie and watch porn.
Listen, you, I'll use these facilities when I'm damn well ready.
Until then, you shall continue to sanitise my crevasse and be damn grateful for the opportunity-starting right...
Peter, I don't care what the other men are getting. You're only getting one.
Oh, this is too perfect! I've been taking the blame for Rex.
I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he bends a French biscuit on the conveyor belt?
Sh. It's OK. We'll meet you in the parking lot.
Look, I... I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.
Doubt that. I've got a very comfortable life. I live with a great family, my needs are met.
OK, look, so maybe this isn't where I thought I was gonna be at seven years old.
It's just that things don't always work out the way we plan.
Now look at me. Middle-aged, alone and peeing in supermarkets.
I had this dream last night. Did you ever see Logan's Run?
Oh. What about him? He's gotta be in his fifties.
I think you're very sensitive and you put up a tough front.
And now Part 2 of our very own Asian correspondent
Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen Isaacs.
Ten years married and still in love. What's their secret?
Judy has an inoperable brain tumour the size of my fist, and that just happens to be Glen's fetish.
Well, I think I have a bit of "me" work to do.
Like most other people, I used to think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs.
Hey, Brian. How you doin'? They let you out already?
I was in a therapy session, not a lunatic asylum.
Hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to lead normal, successful lives.
Dr Kaplan thinks the, uh... accidents are linked to some kind of midlife crisis.
He suggested I go out into the world and pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.
Whoa, hang on. I gave you one of the ones with silverware in it.
But, you know, thanks to these sessions, I think I'm OK.
Being out in the world, feeling my power-and no accidents.
I know Stacey isn't your mother, but upside-down face or not, you have to respect her!
Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again!
I swear, I don't even remember doing it. I don't understand this.
Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose, but maybe we should consider... crating.
Oh, oh, and how embarrassed was I when the word crate came up!
I thought I was past this. I travelled the world, for God's sake.
Drop it. Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual happen to trigger it?
What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray?
Oh, I'm using my special cat power to get Batman all wet.
Well, stunning really. I guess you could say I really...
Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.
Mm-hm. Who are you trying to convince, Brian, me or you?
I don't wanna have to live with plastic on the furniture like some Italian family.
You don't wanna spend your life wondering what could have been.
And to this day I still lay awake at night wondering about the soup that got away.
Thanks, Peter. I'm gonna go find out how she feels.
Stewie's taking a nap and Peter and the kids are out.
And now Part 3 of Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.
Sex-some people have it anonymously. What kind of person would do that? you might ask.
I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs.
Watch as I have sex with this potentially dangerous man, as we take you in-depth and undercover.
It is so refreshing to see something other than violence on the news.
That's OK. The breeze feels good. It's so warm in here.
I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin.
I came about the time you started pummelling her with your tail.
Ha! Oh, oh, this is so good, it just has to be fattening.
Oh, by the way, nice rap. I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile.
Britney and Amber were, like, Let's go to the mall.
I was, like, I'll go to the mall. Then Amber wasn't gonna go.
So I went to the mall, and you're not gonna believe it-they both showed up!
Hold on. Meg, Meg, I'm sorry. That is a really boring story.
I haven't been this bored since that stupid drive-in movie.
But I did use a different brand of potato chips for the crust.
Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting, glow of sensuality that surrounds you.
Lois... did your heart ever want to ask something but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be?
Sometimes we should cherish what we already have, like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share, that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world.
Someone like me wouldn't change it for anything in the world either.
To be clear-we were talking about me being in love with you and you rejecting me, right?
I tell you, Peter, I wish I'd taken this up years ago.
So we're all clear on the rules, then? No Jews and no blacks.
I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards right, I've got seven years ahead of me.
There are a lot of different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was.
So she dumped you, huh? To hell with her. She'll probably end up with some idiot.
A stunning development tonight as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent.
We have the identity of the real killer. But first...
It's fall. The time of year when the leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.
Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they are choosing this year's theme.
Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog.
And here to pick this year's winning theme is Ten Commandments star, Charlton Heston.
And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: The episode of Who's the Boss? ...where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower.
Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave.
It's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric?
Swing and a miss. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse!
What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her...
You know what? There's no room in my car for your big, ugly purse.
Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag.
I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10?
We'll never finish the float in time for the parade.
Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.
But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss.
You're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies.
And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail.
Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots I just want to crack you with a cue stick.
But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you.
And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none were half the man you are.
Since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure.
He's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in?
My daddy always said, Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!
I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing.
If I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.
I have squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video!
I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job.
Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood and clipped onto it is a list of this year's float entries.
Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.
It looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street.
Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though.
This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. That's just plain wrong.
Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them...
Our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire got us free cable.
We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax.
My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself! I'm the boss!
He said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due.
You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes.
You'd be amazed how little one eats when your legs don't work.
Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first.
There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy.
Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again!
Why don't you sit next to my baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry.
That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen.
What's all the noise? I was just jerked out of a sound sleep.
Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
I never said the word stole. Looks like someone has a guilty conscience.
I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable.
Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!
He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth.
If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the time you could do it yourself, like the law says you should.
Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight.
What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Combine one small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman.
Who the hell is that? I bet he took it!
One of our neighbors took that trophy, and I'll find out who.
And to think they used to be our best friends!
And this is a chair. That's a lamp. You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!
To be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over.
We realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy.
There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie?
I'm guessing a cop had something to do with this.
Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security.
Do you have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?
The real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack.
This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks.
And could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby.
Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day.
Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders.
I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks.
Fat boy smelled a hot dog. Couldn't help it. Went right in.
Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins.
Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love?
Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home.
Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head!
Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...
How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week?
It's easy when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby.
Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager?
Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters.
Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him.
We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby.
I never was any good at dealing with the authorities.
I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down.
Crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.
Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others?
You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
We didn't know who she was! It's not our fault!
You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy.
You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships.
We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on.
Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax.
See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home.
He must still be working the junk out of his system.
Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual!
God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers.
When I get him home, I swear I'm gonna grease up...
Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban?
Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country.
And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who in turn sells them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family.
So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other?
Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on!
Joe and Cleveland can't stall them. They're heading your way!
But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side.
You people can kiss the fattest part of my ass!
Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound but if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
If it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived.
Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?
I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here?
A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard.
A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor...
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump!
The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey.
That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans.
Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and...
The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist.
Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have?
Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live.
But what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had.
Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap.
No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother!
Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay.
Guys, I don't say this often enough, but I'm gonna die.
You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance?
You can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments.
I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60.
I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead.
Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike.
This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all.
My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me.
As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle.
Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?
I'm fine? What? Are you coming on to me now?
Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.
Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids.
Is this the price of my bill or my phone number?
It's still pretty pricey! Peter, who cares how much it is?
You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health.
Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem?
This sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this?
Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill.
All I gotta do is write deceased right here where it says name.
And where it says sex, I'll write, No, thanks. I'm dead.
I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long...
I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death.
Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay.
I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death!
Death, you made a mistake. I'm not supposed to be dead.
I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names.
I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband!
Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest!
Won't you join us for dinner? Oh, no. I don't want to impose.
We were in the middle of a turkey dinner to celebrate Peter's good health.
No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl.
Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest!
My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde.
Let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not particularly proud of.
After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years.
I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now.
Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man.
Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like.
A 20-minute call to Larchmont? Who do we know in Larchmont?
Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol?
Hey, Death, you got a file on me? Yeah, it's in the car, I think.
Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track?
Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you?
Yeah. That felt good, dropping me on the couch like that.
I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do?
Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein.
I have to stay off it for a while. Not here.
Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper?
Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die.
Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die?
You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers l'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire.
Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face.
Now that I've been given another chance l'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing.
Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear.
You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this?
I know I should find this ironic, but I'm just bored as hell.
You can probably get the DuMont Network on this thing.
Could you please find it in your heart to spare him?
If you want me to make it again... Sorry, my fault.
I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap!
I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly.
I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder.
It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile.
I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone
I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning.
Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire!
You guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: Aren't you Richard Simmons?
Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. I really wanted to be a wood nymph.
Man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: I have no son. I have no son, and Mom just stood there.
He's okay. He reminds me a lot of me at that age.
I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward.
He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me...
What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup.
Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV.
Our top story tonight, the rules of death no longer apply.
Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself!
I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die.
Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed?
And since the laws of death no longer apply, I can do this.
The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again.
Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts!
You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle.
This is all your fault. And there's only one solution.
You have to go out there and do my job.
Death, there is no way Peter can do your job.
Yeah! I've thought about it, like in church and stuff but I don't think I could ever do what you do.
I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done.
Yeah, about that I was pretty sure I was gonna die because there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious.
You're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone?
You could kill Lois. No. One death isn't gonna do it.
You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge.
You could kill any girls who are prettier than me.
I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!
I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids.
The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts.
But their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island.
I'm not doing your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane.
It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features.
I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice.
About that, I don't think I can go through with it.
Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place.
Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt.
If you're going to be in L.A. And would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen!
Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA.
We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International.
If you look out the window, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn.
We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes. We like being alive, we like being alive We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive
Actually, it's well, Pacey. You mean to say, I make love well.
Peter? Hello? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing?
Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind.
I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids.
If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays other than the fine programs on Fox.
What are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world!
I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error.
I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die.
Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black star of such films as Nashville and Five Easy Pieces, was on board.
Hats off to Miss Black for proving once again that, given the opportunity actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.
What the hell? I told you to waste the Dawson's Creek kids.
You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply.
My ankle's starting to feel better. I should probably get out of your hair.
We can stay in touch, can't we? What's your e-mail?
I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met.
Because you've given me a great gift. The complete Boz Scaggs.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save a fish's life trapped under the frozen ice.
Rescue workers got the fish out of the water but unfortunately it died shortly after.
Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players passed away this afternoon.
Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows most recently, Miss Saigon. La la la la la, Miss Saigon La la la la la, Miss Saigon
They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players!
This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players.
All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off.
Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm.
Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive.
Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.
This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company!
Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board may I present this year's hottest toy Mr. Zucchini Head.
He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens.
Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think.
Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions.
I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser.
Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine.
And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith?
I think Lois is saying that you have to find a way to express yourself creatively.
For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully.
Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I.
It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal...
Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at.
I know you can do it if you put your mind to it.
You're right. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.
It works! Look how tiny they are! Oh, no not in springtime summer, winter, or fall No, never would I leave you at all
And that note you gave me, louder, I was thinking that, and then you said it.
Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York.
How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries!
Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: I'm going to kill you!
Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent?
Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said.
I started to think there was nothing I'd be good at.
Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance.
This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director.
Five, six, seven, eight. Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition Met the greatest earthquake ever known High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft And plunged them down a thousand feet below to the Land of the Lost
Before I post the cast list my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning.
I only wish the show was called The King and Us so I could cast you all.
Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once but then we later found out it wasn't actually her.
Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films!
The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected!
Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not The King.
It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.
We made the deal. We're richer and more powerful than ever!
You screwed it all up. Let me show you again.
And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three.
Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole.
Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin.
There is no talking penguin in The King and I.
There is in Peter Griffin presents The King and I.
Now we gotta think of some funny stuff for him to say.
Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character.
What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas?
Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them?
Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater.
It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house.
I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there.
Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!
I'm presenting Peter Griffin presents The King and l a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story.
For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn?
Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did.
Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I.
In other news, I'm not going to the play because I'm sure it'll be lousy.
I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.
Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane?
But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job.
People who've never been in a theater will come see Diane Simmons.
Some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn.
Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's gonna be a...
You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you.
Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.
They did an all-you-people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.
Action! Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him. Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him.
On Springer yesterday, they had I won't share my husband and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts.
If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent?
Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippie, you know?
I thought we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants.
You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber!
We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes.
And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!
What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did.
I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that!
I don't know what to say, except, I'm the king of the...
I just made a few creative changes to the recipe.
Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno.
It is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno.
Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming.
Face it, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours.
I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas.
That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art.
Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare.
Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life!
You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show.
I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m.
The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M is exactly what you've turned my show into.
I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois.
Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life.
I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready!
It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her!
We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along.
Someone radiant and sassy with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression.
If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night?
If I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?
The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War.
It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity.
A future where an oppressive new king has seized power.
I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny.
I have been expecting you, ANNA. Let me introduce my Siamese children.
I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all-female sex orgy.
I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America. ANNA rules Because I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels ANNA won Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun Dance and shout 'He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt Though they tried to defeat me they can all just freakin' eat me Because he blew all of us away In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay
Stop it! Stop clapping right now! What's wrong with you?
That man has committed murder here this evening and the victim's name is theater.
This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland!
See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about.
Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life.
I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me.
But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is well, he's gotta be creative.
Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Pawtucket Patriot beer. If you buy it, hot women will have sex in your back yard.
Of course a man made it. It's a commercial, Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat! Ha-ha!
Holy crap! We did! We won a free freakin' boat!
Hello, China? I have something you may want, but it's gonna cost you.
I knew there was a catch. You have to sit through an awful time-share presentation.
A small price to pay. I'm gonna be the first one on Spooner Street to have his own boat.
Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy on Spooner Street to get a boat.
These wonderful homes on this beautifully secluded island can be yours with almost no strings attached.
That's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a woman, you'll do something stupid, like buy that time-share, or not realise I taped over our wedding video with soft-core porn.
The couple has written their own vows, which they will now recite.
Look, the only reason I got myself arrested was to find out what happened to my sister.
It's so cold in here. I mean, look at my...
Oh, my God, Peter. I sent a copy of that tape to my great-aunt Lil.
Mr and Mrs... Griffin. If you sign this contract without reading it, I'll take your blank cheque, and you won't not be not loving your time-share before you know it.
We're not gonna buy your lousy time-share, all right? Now where's my boat?
A boat's a boat, but the mystery box could be anything.
It could even be a boat! You know how much we want one.
We'll take the box. We'll take the box. You gave up a boat for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.
You're acting like this is the first time I've ever done something stupid.
A boat's a boat, but the mystery box could be anything.
It could even be a boat! You know how much we want one.
Hey, look at me! I'm the man in the boat! All right!
That's called starboard. But I'll forgive you cos you sex me up. Now give me some sugar.
Hey, Quagmire, maybe the comedian will tell some jokes about boats or boating or owning a boat.
Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes about being a sucker.
Why are you upset? I never even knew you liked boats.
Boating's in my blood. Ever since my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin, rafted down the mighty Mississippi.
That is our word. You've got no right using it.
This comic sucks! He couldn't make me laugh even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it. Huh?
Oh, well, pardon me for thinking a microphone stand in a comedy club should tell a joke or two.
That was even funnier than your first joke. Put Skinny back up there.
Maybe you shouldn't do this. You've never had a lot of luck telling jokes.
OK, OK. How many dirty, stinking apes does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Three. One dirty, stinking ape to screw in the light bulb, and two dirty, stinking apes to throw faeces at each other.
Yeah. Well, you gu... you guys are stupid and ugly.
Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman who takes for ever to cook breakfast?
I rather enjoyed that. Yes, yes. Yes, you cook very slowly.
As a matter of fact, if you were any slower at cooking, you'd... well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
They laughed because it looked like you peed yourself, not because they liked your jokes.
Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very edgy, but an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.
If you cooked any more slowly, you wouldn't need an egg timer, you'd need an egg calendar! Ha-ha-ha!
So you got something to look at while you're talking to 'em.
So you got something to look at while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
So you got something to look at while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Mr Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent one of your co-workers, Sarah Bennett.
Oh, is she the one we video-taped taking a dump?
First of all, if I can speak in my own defence, all I did was tell a little joke.
They are devices built by the Lord Jesus Christ for our entertainment.
Miss Ironbox, I assure you this company in no way condones Peter's conduct.
In fact, a film on employee relations has been a mandatory part of our personnel training for 50 years.
Irrational and emotionally fragile by nature, female co-workers are a peculiar animal.
Be sure to tell them how good they look every day, even if they're homely and unkempt.
You're doing a great job, Muriel, and you're prettier than Mamie Van Doren.
And, remember, nothing says good job like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.
I teach a workplace sensitivity training class for the Women's Action Coalition.
If Mr Griffin completes my course, we'll drop the lawsuit.
I assure you, Peter will be there. His job depends on it.
You know, if I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.
All right, now let's do some role-playing. I'll be the office assistant.
Mr Hanson, you play the boss and we'll see what you've learned tonight.
You are a valued member of our business team and every bit as important to this company as I am.
Excellent. Mr Griffin, why don't you come up here and give it a try?
You're a valued member of our business team and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without a shirt on.
There's some subtleties to the rules that aren't so easy to understand.
A week at a women's retreat. What the hell am I supposed to learn from that?
That's a bad mud puddle. I wouldn't want you to step in that and get your nice shoes all ruined.
Then you got caught peeping in the ladies' locker room.
You know I love you, but I have to admit there are times when I wish you were a little more sensitive.
I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here to get in touch with his feminine side.
This world would be far better if there were more men like him.
OK, OK, so here's what I'm thinking. I'll be Charlie and you can all be my angels.
If we can endure the pain of childbirth, imagine what else we're capable of.
Wah, wah, wah. Come on! It's only childbirth. How much could it hurt?
It's like taking your bottom lip and stretching it over your head to the back of your neck.
Hey, you wanna hear some horror stories, what about what I went through when Lois was pregnant?
We are conditioned to feel competitive with other women when we should be supportive.
Lizzy, I know you feel alone and unattractive since your husband left you.
But you are a beautiful person and I am here for you.
Notice I'm making physical contact with her in order to establish a connection.
You'd make more of a connection if you hugged her.
It's OK. It's OK to like it. It's very natural.
OK, ladies. I'm gonna start with a Greg Louganis triple Salchow and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half...
Now that you've felt a woman's pain, the learning can begin.
But first I'm gonna go freshen up and rinse out a few things.
I can't remember the last time we cuddled like this.
I can't remember the last time I loved you so much.
When I was born, my mommy dunked me in a barrel of sugar.
I just wanted to say hi. So what are you d...?
Sometimes I just can't believe we could make something so beautiful.
I really appreciate all the hard work you did giving birth and mothering our kids.
Peter, I'm sure you would have been a great mother if you'd had the chance.
Well, I don't have a lot of options. I'm Catholic!
Oh. Oh, this is just great. Now my own wife is forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?
Peter, you're my husband. At least, you used to be.
Oh, Mother, I come bearing a gift. I'll give you a hint.
Fine. But this time if a boy calls, please don't tell him I'm wrist-deep in poopie.
Honey, I'm glad you discovered your feminine side, but I didn't want you to forget about mine.
Hi, Glen. I'm sorry to bother you. Is this a bad time?
It's never a bad time when you're with the Q man. Come on in.
Well, as you may have noticed, Peter's been acting a little different lately.
It was refreshing at first, but now... well, he doesn't even treat me like a woman any more.
I know where this is going, Lois, and I'm already semi there. Oh!
Anyways, Glen, I was wondering if you and Cleveland could help change Peter back to the way he was.
If we're gonna remasculate Peter, we need to surround him with chicks.
Let's blow this sausagefest and hit the house of tail.
No. He needs to learn how to respect his fellow man.
I can't respect men. Men are the reason our world is in such lousy shape.
If men were as caring as women, we wouldn't have crime or violence.
Excuse me. I'd like to say a couple of truths to the men in this audience.
It's your fault we have so much crime in this country and it's your fault we have so much violence in this country.
You are ruining our society and you should be ashamed!
Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta write. The View should be on for three hours.
Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are gonna whip it out and see whose is bigger.
His wife, yes. Peter tells me you don't have a career of your own.
Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen is so bright and scary.
Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile toward someone who's fighting so a woman like you can become more than just a housewife.
Look, I'm all for equality, but if you ask me feminism is about choice.
I choose to be a wife and mother. And now I'm choosing to end this conversation.
I can't imagine how screwed up your kids must be.
I'm just gonna assume that's Chinese for I love you.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Yeah, me and Dad haven't missed a Gumbel 2 Gumbel yet.
After I get a little bit of courage from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels.
He was a wise man, but he just loved playing with that wheat thresher.
Honey, hold still and let me bathe you. You're filthy.
You're the filthy one. What do you say to that?
And take pictures so I'll have something to bring to court, you filthy pervert.
Hey, Lois, give Chris a break. I mean, no TV?
He failed a class, it's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that Thanksgiving when I was 19.
Kids do better when parents take an interest in their schoolwork.
I saw that on a two-part report on Dateline Tuesday and Dateline Gatilsday.
NBC invented a new day so they could add another Dateline.
Bryant and Greg have the kind of father-son relationship I want me and Chris to have someday.
Nice. Just because they're black, we can't learn anything from them?
If Chris gets his homework done, you can watch it together next week.
Now come on. Help me get the house ready for my mother.
Peter, I thought we agreed, no TV until his homework is done.
In fact, I've been helping him study every night this week.
Tonight, Katie Couric guest stars as a very perky crack whore.
Dad, when you said, Chris finished his homework, were you talking about me?
Because if you were, I think you just lied to mom.
Chris, everything I say is a lie, except that and that.
I've got the goods, but have I got the guts? Find out at 11:00.
If you're waiting for Gumbel 2 Gumbel, you're out of luck.
The full story, and maybe Diane's boobs, tonight at 11:00.
We gotta save Gumbel 2 Gumbel, and were gonna do it Griffin 2 Griffin.
I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble. If you don't put Coach back on the air, I'll be really upset. The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson will be missed a lot. Signed, Peter Griffin.
Okay, we're gonna get our show back on the air and were not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types.
I mean, you can't go in there, because that door leads nowhere.
All right, Callaghan, me and my son want you to uncancel Gumbel 2 Gumbel.
We only air the show. We have nothing to do with it being canceled.
I have all the episodes on tape if you want to borrow them.
Until you bring the Gumbels back, I am going on a hunger strike.
And in gridiron news, little Johnny Gobraun a terminally ill 8-year-old who dreamed of playing quarterback for New England got his wish today thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.
Chris, I just thought of a way to get the Gumbels back on the air.
All we gotta do is tell a little white lie. Just go with it.
Chris, this is just another one of your crazy schemes.
Wait a minute. My son only has a short time to live.
All he wants is his favorite show back on TV. How can you say no?
But these days, people who donate money to our foundation demand a little more bang for their buck.
I'm telling you, Chris is dying ten times worse than those other kids.
My son happens to be very sensitive about his extra nipples.
A single white girl in the city working at a magazine!
This is the same old crap over and over again.
We need to take a chance. Try something different. Something fresh.
Get me exclusive rights to his death and you got a deal.
I've two more kids, and I've always wanted to see new episodes of Star Trek.
Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little boy!
I say, Mother, you have your work cut out for you now, don't you?
Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test, but I got a good reason.
That's the lamest excuse I've heard since Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap.
That was just a little white lie we came up with to save a TV show.
Boy, your face was priceless when you thought he was.
What the hell is that? Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog Chris Griffin, you're so brave There's a smile on your face and a bounce in your step as they dig your grave as they dig your grave
The sitcom that's funnier when you play it really loud.
Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!
Peter, why are these people here? As they dig my grave, as they dig my grave
We just came by to see if your son's taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.
Mr. Griffin, the foundation held up its end of the bargain and got that crappy Gumbel show back on the air!
You pretended Chris was dying to save a TV show?
I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have to die and best of all, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.
What kind of man devalues the life of his child for a TV show?
Anyone who wouldn't pretend their own son is dying to get the Gumbels back on TV is a racist.
It's him! It's Peter Griffin! The miracle healer of Quahog!
You see what your lies have done? They think you're some kind of healer.
I read a book about this sort of thing once.
What would you have us do, O great healer of Quahog?
There's really no need to do anything. Paint my house.
It's bad enough to lie to your family but how can you let these people think you're a healer?
Those films my cousin Rufus used to do were pure exploitation.
From the cats who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft and Black Kramer v. Kramer, comes a funky flick so bad you gonna say, Damn, that's funky.
Isaac, you know that new sound you been looking for?
Come on, Lois. Stop being such a stick in the mud.
Now do it again, and this time leave it a little longer.
Purse snatching, society's fault, or one man's cry for help?
What are you talking about? I wanted her freakin' money.
So I told a little fib, and now people think I'm God.
When did God ever say He didn't want someone else being worshipped like Him?
Come on. Those were written, like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!
Lois, if you're scared, I'll hold you until the lights are on again.
I still don't know how every light bulb could go out at the same time.
Those fanatics are building a golden idol of you on our lawn.
Our fresh-faced little boy is becoming a pock-marked hideously disfigured man. Sunrise. Sunset.
No. The light bulbs last night, my fleas, Chris' pimples.
Three of the plagues God visited upon Egypt in the Old Testament.
Come on, there's a logical explanation for all those things.
There was a power surge, you don't bathe and Chris has had acne problems since the fourth grade.
The kids were all calling him Crisco and Pizza Face and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry. Remember, Chris?
No! The water, it turned all red and goopy, like blood!
How positively delightful. It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!
Make them stop worshipping you before it starts hailing in my house!
I'm just a big fake like the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman!
The final plague is the death of the first-born son.
Hey, Dad, I can see a white light at the end of a long tunnel.
Oh, that's great, son. Light is good. Run towards the light.
Hey, Dad, do you think they got Gumbel 2 Gumbel in heaven?
Yes, son, and there's no reruns or commercials and Kirstie Alley is still hot and all those scrambled channels come in clear as a bell.
lt seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV but where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy l say, Rupert, these crumpets you've prepared look positively divine!
Stewie, l've told you before, don't eat dirt. lt's disgusting.
And l suppose the bilious curds you force-fed me from your teat were perfectly fine then?
So the square of a hypotenuse, which we will label C making the sides opposite both of the acute angles A and B always equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.
Even if winning means spending time out of the house and away from my family.
Out of the house? Why, l'd be free from your oppressive gynocracy!
You should be out giving speeches, shaking hands, kissing babies!
Boy, l'll be glad when that studio audience moves out of the neighborhood.
You guys? Chris' principal just called. Chris is in trouble.
Mr. Griffin, l'm afraid l have bad news. l caught your son peeking into the girls' locker room.
So what's the big deal? lt's normal for a boy his age to be curious. l remember when l first noticed girls starting to develop.
Locker assignments wiII be handed out in the Iibrary after Iunch period,
If you have any questions about your Iocker assignments or your cIass scheduIe, pIease come...,
Your mother is right, son. Listen to what it says.
Take out your scalpels, kids. We're going to dissect a clown!
No wonder this clown died. His lungs are filled with candy!
Why don't you go say hello? l'm gonna drop off some campaign flyers in the teachers' lounge.
You even taught me how to dance just in time for the prom.
Yeah. Now add a little turn and do a buck and wing.
Jeez, Mr. Fargas, what happened to you? Somebody give you a fun-ectomy?
No, they gave me these by order of the School Board.
Sorry to fly off the handle. Here, let me see that.
That's what l think about you taking chill pills from the Man.
Look, the old Farg made learning fun. He's what these kids need.
Now get back in that classroom and teach your Fargin' ass off.
Chris, your mother wants me and you to have a talk.
Now, son, as men, it's only natural for us to look at naked girls.
But peeping can be dangerous, so l brought you this.
Now you can look at naked girls all you want and it's perfectly legal!
Just a little present your mom gave me for our anniversary.
Mom, if you get elected can you fix it so l win Homecoming Queen?
This campaign literature must be posted today to get you into office and out of my life, you festering strumpet!
The egg drop, an annuaI tradition for junior-high-schooI science students,
Today at Buddy Cianci Junior High, an egg drop conducted by teacher RandaII Fargas seems to have gone horribIy wrong,
We now go Iive to Action News 5 Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa,
Tom, the eggs being dropped behind me are not chicken eggs but those of the endangered CaIifornia condor,
Oh, my God. He's gonna wipe that species off the face of the earth!
I'm getting word that the Quahog SchooI Board has just dismissed RandaII Fargas, ending his 32-year teaching career,
In other news, Betsy Lebeau, SchooI Board President candidate announced today she's puIIing out of the race,
Great. You can get Mr. Fargas his job back. l'm sorry! But l do have a mind of my own!
And l happen to agree with the School Board's decision. l know you're a feminist and l think that's adorable but this is grown-up time and l'm the man. l'm not giving that lunatic his job back and that's final.
Lois, l can't let you deprive our children of a fine teacher like Mr. Fargas. l'm gonna stop you the only way l can by killing you in the race for School Board President!
Peter, are you sure running against Lois is such a good idea?
You know how competitive you get. l can be just as non-competitive as anybody.
Matter of fact, l'm the most non-competitive. So l win.
Peter, since when do you care about the School Board?
Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap and if running against you is the only way to get him back then l am gonna run like the Six Million Dollar Man.
We have the technology, but l don't want to spend a lot of money.
Fine, if you feel that strongly, then by all means run.
But l'm warning you, l'm not gonna pull any punches on the issues. l'm Lois.
Look at me with my big ideas and my pointy nose,
This'll be even easier than running unopposed. ls that so?
Not only am l gonna win this election l am gonna eat your nose.
You're talking to a guy who uses his tongue for toilet paper.
The matron of prattle has left me in your ward.
Don't just sit there! l have misbehaved! l've been a bawdy little monkey! lf that vile woman were here, she'd prove a worthy adversary.
Yes, that's it. That's quite good. Yes, l miss my mommy.
Hey, Chris! Hector found two rocks outside that look like boobs! You in?
Peter, l'm concerned that your candidacy may have become a lost cause.
The debate is tonight and you don't seem to have any supporters.
Don't sweat it, the Griffin men have always been winners dating back to my diminutive great-grandfather, Juarez Griffin.
Fellas, the debate's in the bag, all right? lf there's one thing l can do, it's play to a crowd.
Lois Griffin, daughter of shipping industriaIist, Carter Pewterschmidt and passive-aggressivist, Barbara Pewterschmidt,
Tonight she takes on her greatest chaIIenge, Peter Griffin Quahog's native son, seIf-described Huguenot, don't know what that means and community activist,
So fasten your seat beIts, We're just minutes away from Lois versus Peter, Griffin versus Griffin on Monday Night Debate, y'aII! Of suns and worlds l nothing had to say l see mankind's self-torturing pains
When you read Faust you're supposed to do Mephistopheles in a scary voice like this! ls that the way Mommy reads it? l do not miss that ogress.
She can burn in hell for all l care! Sure she can.
Damn! l've grown accustomed to her face She almost makes the day begin l've grown accustomed to the tune that she whistles night and noon Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs are second nature to me now Like breathing out and breathing in l'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget, rather like a habit one can always break And yet, l've grown accustomed to her looks Accustomed to her voice Accustomed to her face
This is Iife, the one you get, so go and have a baII because the worId don't move to the beat of just one drum,
What might be right for you, may not be right for some,
You take the good, you take the bad you take them both, and there you have my opening statement,
As a piano teacher, I know how difficuIt the education process can be,
That's why, if I'm eIected, I promise to fight for competent teachers a better-funded music department and updated textbooks that don't refer to the CiviI Rights Movement as troubIe ahead,
As a rich coIIege-bound student, I once joined some underpriviIeged youths in saving a community center from being converted into a shopping maII,
I'm gonna take the highroad and stick to the issues,
They deserve a schooI board president who doesn't Ieave their feminine ointments in the fridge next to the mustard! That was the worst hot dog I ever ate!
Yeah, she fIosses in bed, she snores Iike a wiIdebeest--
So ask yourseIf what kind of future wiII it be if you eIect a man who has never taught a student or even been to a PTA meeting,
This is a man who beIieves the pIuraI of goose is sheep!
I'm the right person for the job, Vote for me,
Peter! Come on! Stop, Shut up! You guys shut up! l didn't enjoy humiliating Peter, but what choice did l have?
As soon as the polls close, we can put all this ugliness behind us.
A Iot of nasty things have been said during this campaign,
But pictures are better than words because some words are big and hard to understand,
Do you reaIIy want your chiIdren's future in the hands of this?
Paid for by the Peter Griffin for SchooI Board President Committee,
Sorry, Lois, Lewd, obscene, and a little blurry just some of the words used to describe Lois Griffin's prurient pic.
Yesterday, voters overwhelmingly declared that Lois Griffin is not the kind of person they want running their schools.
Don't feel bad, Mom. All my friends think you're hot!
Lois, l got a joke for you. How many losers does it take to make me breakfast?
Don't even talk to me, Peter. You humiliated your own wife!
And for what? To get that crazy Mr. Fargas back in the classroom?
Winning was only half the battle. lf you blow this chance to do something good for our kids you'll be the biggest loser!
Peter Griffin is no loser! When l'm through with our schools our students'll be so smart they'll be able to program their VCRs without spilling piping hot gravy all over myself.
This is Trisha Takanawa, here with School Board President Peter Griffin.
Mr. President, you've accomplished so much in just a few short weeks.
Thanks, Connie. l'm very excited about our progress in revamping our schools.
For starters, we're making sex education more fun. Vagina junction, what's your function? Taking in sperm and spitting out babies
And our schools are the safest around thanks to the hall monitor XL-K. HaIt! Present haII pass!
But.... Right here! Security breach! l guess Little Miss Free Spirit will think twice before roaming the halls. l've restocked our school library with books of some of our greatest movies and TV shows.
Because if we don't teach our kids to read, how will they ever know what's on?
Mr. Griffin, this is impressive. l've never seen kids so enthusiastic about reading.
Hey, son, show the folks at home what you got there.
There's quite a crowd outside. l haven't witnessed pandemonium like this since Ridiculous Day down at the deli when prices were so low they were ridiculous.
You said it, pally. That's why l brought in the big guns.
Say how do to the Ragin' Cajun, Mr. James Carville.
Now see, Peter, what you gotta do is you gotta declare war! War!
Your only chance of surviving this scandal is to claim that Lois gave your boy the pornography.
And he's right. Pin it on the old ball and chain. l can't do that. Lois is mad enough at me without.... l'm sorry. l can't look at you! l mean, l can handle ugly. But this is like circus ugly.
Lois, l need your help. You gotta come to my press conference this afternoon.
We now take you live to Peter Griffin Junior High where embattled School Board President Peter Griffin is fighting for his political life.
Mom, what are you doing here? l thought you were mad at Dad. l am. l just came to see him twist in the wind.
Oh, honey. Maybe. A parent giving porno to their kid is a terribIe thing... ...but I'm here to teII you that I'm innocent!
Oh, yeah. Right. I didn't give those magazines to my son, My wife, Lois...,
Crap, Look, my wife, Lois, is the most important person in the worId to me,
Even worse, I turned a beautifuI gift from Lois into something cheap and tawdry,
Now I know that some things are more important than winning,
Lois, I onIy hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,
So you're saying you're not only a bad father, but a bad husband, too?
And so ends a dark and shameful chapter in the history of Quahog, Rhode lsland.
How much moral bankruptcy and perversion must we, the people, endure?
In tonight's episode, the part of Brian the dog will be played by Carter Banks.
Or would you rather chew on your own ass, as usual?
Well, I'm... I'm sure you have something to say to that, hm?
Oh. Oh, God, sorry. Can you give me the line again? Not the whole line, just the end of it.
Oh! Let's cut. All right, you're sleeping with which producer?
God, as soon as my movie deal kicks in, I am such a ghost!
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Peter, I don't think... Peter, please, I'm begging you, stop the car!
Bob's Funland and Putt Putt Golf! The grown-up in me likes the prospect of fun.
But the kid in me is suicidal over what a fat bastard I'll become.
Excuse me, excuse me. My friend is differently-abled. May he go ahead of you?
Well, hello! You must be this beautiful to ride the Quagmire.
Your father! Sometimes I don't think he'll be happy until he's completely paralysed.
Ooh! How deliciously evil-Iooking. It's like something out of Stephen King.
OK, for my 307th book, uh, this couple is attacked by a... a...
This is my rifle, this is my gun This is for fighting, this is for fun
Let me give you a tip, pally. The shortest distance between two points is the full-body-English high-arcing rainbow shot.
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you and your party to leave.
Perhaps we should just continue the party at some other type of location.
No, no, no, wait. I know this guy. We went to high school together.
He was a loser then, and he's a loser now.
Oh, we used to kid this guy all the time.
So we're not goin' just cos some little pissant tells us to. I demand to see the owner.
That's right. This place is my legacy. So what have you done with your life, you jerk?
I'm Neptune, god of the sea! I sink ships and conjure up storms!
No, you're not. I am. And you know nothing of my work.
Look at this, Lois. See, right here. I was voted Most Likely to Succeed.
Peter, that's not you. That's not even a yearbook, it's a People Magazine.
Oh. I wondered why they had the wrong picture and name.
Did you forge my name?! Oh, is that backward S supposed to be cute?
Face it, Lois, I'm a nobody. Why can't I be famous like Bob?
Then I got on Suddenly Susan,  and that was, like, really cool.
I still do stand-up, people laugh and give me money, that's also cool.
I don't get it. I poured it in her drink. ...name was Steve Rock. First black I ever did it with.
Don't be depressed, Dad. Here, I made you a present.
It's partly an expression of my teenage angst, but mostly it's a moo-cow.
Ooh, sorry, chief. Seems he already sold his soul in 1976 for Bee Gees tickets.
Don't forget this. Maybe you could hang it in your office.
Son, I'll put it someplace where everyone can see it.
Excuse me. I'll give you $1,000 for what you have in the back there.
No, no, no. I mean that painting. I must have it for my gallery in SoHo.
I love you, you freakin' son of mine! I got
Don't feel bad, Chris. I didn't even want it. Now we all get a free trip to New York cos Mr Monatti thinks you could be a famous artist.
Oh, oh, oh! He's only the biggest art dealer in New York!
I met him when I was hanging out with Andy Warhol in the '70s.
Lois, our son has been blessed with a great gift, and I'm gonna do everything I can to nurture that talent and help him succeed.
Then I'll use him to live out all my frustrated hopes and dreams, because that's good parenting, right, Bing Crosby?
Right, Peter. And if your kids give you any lip, you can beat 'em with a sack of sweet Valencia oranges.
They won't leave a bruise, and they'll let 'em know who's boss. There's no doubt about it.
I'll take this belt off and put the smack-down on you. Is that what you want? Huh?
Hi, this is David Leisure. You probably remember me as the neighbour from TV's Empty Nest.
No? Well, how about those car commercials when I played Joe Isuzu?
Oh, come on! Those were really popular.  They ran all the time.
All right, look. Just buckle up.  Can I get my cheque now?
Oh, kids, look at that man over there, grabbin' his own crotch. Oh! So alive, this city!
New York has some of the best restaurants in the world. They even have Indian food here.
Just make sure there's a Wall Street Journal by the changing table.
My son's gonna be the best thing to happen to New York since Mayor Giuliani had all the homeless secretly killed.
Hey, you guys have any bellhops that are rats, like the Muppets?
Count me out. I'm never going to the theatre with Peter again.
Uncle Vanya used to spend whole nights translating books for you.
Uncle Vanya and I worked without rest, afraid to spend a kopeck on ourselves.
What the hell is this? For cryin' out loud, somebody throw a pie!
Screw the theatre. Mr Monatti invited us to a cocktail party so Chris can meet some artists.
It's at the Museum of Modern Art. Oh, God. I hope that's not some kind of museum.
I'll draw him pooping on your chest. What number is he?
Welcome. Chris, there are a number of artists here I'd like you to meet.
We've been here all day, and Chris isn't a famous artist yet.
You want to be a star, don't you? Then take it off!
Art school? We don't have that kind of time. Chris, give me your ear.
Please, I invited you so that Chris could make an impression on the art community.
Why not do some sightseeing? If you leave Chris in my hands, the name Griffin
Ah, the United Nations! Oh, I wish Chris could see this.
Isn't it inspiring how so many different cultures can come together?
Yeah, and use up all the towels in the men's room.
Trust me, painting is the least important thing about being a successful artist.
You need an image! Let's take this Rhode Island lump of clay
Cut it and tint it green, the colour of money.
I don't know how you can find anything in this city. It's so confusing.
Well, I bet if Hillary Clinton becomes senator, she'll straighten it out.
Ha, ha, ha! I love when you use topical humour.
Hey, Murphy. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, John Sununu.
Hey, Murph. You can't blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah the Ayatollah.
They'd rather wander through SoHo, looking for an address that doesn't exist.
Ha, ha, ha! That's my dad! Well, maybe tomorrow, we could all...
Not any more. Christobel will look better in Interview magazine.
Yes. I know how important your success is to your father.
That's why he'll understand that you can never see him again.
Christobel, the art world is a place of culture and breeding.
Your father is, uh... How can I say this without upsetting you?
So, you see, it's up to you, son. If you don't wanna disappoint your father, keep him away.
There's my boy! Hey, come on, Chris. Let's go to Barneys and fart in the suits.
Mr Griffin, he's going to be a great artist. He now belongs to the public.
Oh, and, um, don't say anything bad about her, cos she might be here right now.
Wait a minute! You can't... you can't just push me aside.
Oh, Bobby Williams, I'd love to go out with you.
I can't believe Chris. If I hadn't used his painting to patch that window,
That dump is our home. Dump? Oh, so now you're too good for us, too?
Peter, your son is using his talents to pursue his dream.
Fine. If Chris doesn't need me, I don't need him.
You'll love being famous, Meg, and this is the town to do it in.
Everybody's good at somethin'. It's just a matter of findin' the special hidden talent.
But promise me, when you make it big, you'll let me take advantage of all the...
I can't think of anything. I guess I don't have any talent.
Come on, think harder! There's gotta be somethin' you can do.
You know what a pain in the ass it is to get across town, this time of day? Huh?
I don't fly, you know. I take the subway like everybody else.
Oh, and people don't stare. You make me puke. Bitch.
Mr Monatti, I don't feel like painting. I wanna see my dad.
Listen, Christobel. I've sunk $5,000 turning you into a New York bohemian.
All you have to do is paint. Now get busy!
I have to go oil up and start squeezing into my leather pants. Excuse me.
I don't know. You're the flavour of the month. Oops! Window open.
Now, wait just a minute, young lady. Don't you walk away from me.
Meg? Meg, listen to me. Don't you dare get on that plane.
Don't shell out five bucks for headphones for Magnolia.  OK. Now, I'm pissed.
Wait a second. I don't see any strippers passing out free tacos. Lois, you lied to me!
Oh, for someone with no breasts, you've done very well for yourself. Good for you!
Michelangelo unveils the Sistine Chapel. that look suspiciously like vaginas.
I guess I was wrong about you. You're no artist. You're just a no-talent punk.
Now hold on a second. You can talk to my daughter that way, but not my son.
You owe me for all that money I invested in your worthless son.
Work of art? Or container of crazy purple knockout gas?
Dad, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be a famous artist you can mooch off of.
Ah, that's OK, kids. So I don't have my name on an amusement park, and maybe I'll never be famous.
But I got three wonderful children, and a wife that loves me.
That's right. I guess when it comes right down to it, you're a pretty lucky...
I've been looking everywhere for a face to launch my new line of diapers.
Well, Bob Funland may have his name on the sign, but only a Griffin has this.
I'm going to sex you up so crazy, yeah! Oh, you're loving this, aren't you?
All right, we're gonna use a fan brush here. I want you to take some hunter green, and we're gonna put a happy little bush down here in the corner.
And if you tell anyone that that bush is there...
I will come to your house and I will cut you.
Aw, jeez. Mine doesn't look anything like his. Ah, the hell with it.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Ha! Boy, you throw like a fishwife. Come on, ya hairy, lubbin', friggin' rod.
All the money goes to the families of fishermen who've been eaten by sharks.
It was 360 years ago that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket set sail for the new colony of Rhode Island.
You know what I'm gonna do when we get to shore? First, I'm gonna have a snack.
I hope I see Indians! Think they'll have American cheese?
Ever the free thinker, Miles was thrown overboard for speaking his mind.
But, as legend has it,  he was saved by a magic clam, who brought him to shore and shared the vision of a new colony, which would be called Quahog.
There are fields for tilling, woods for timber, and always the bounty of the sea.
Look at all this sand! Do you know there are beaches with black sand?
I know he's an Indian, but what kind of a name is Squanto?
God! Keep it to yourself once in a while! Oh!
Here, look what I'm doing. All right? Look, watch this.
Things only got worse. Before long,  Miles began to contemplate killing the clam.
Miles never spoke again. But every year until his death - from a combination of tuberculosis and a tomahawk to the head - he went to the shore on this day in hopes that the magic clam would return.
Whose idea was it to make the suit out of foam rubber?
It's such an honour to play the magic clam. Aren't you proud of your dad, kids?
Are you kidding? God, this is worse than having Ronald McDonald for a father.
Come back here. You're not going out with all that make-up on.
How could you embarrass me?! Nobody better pull this crap at my slumber party.
Don't worry. You and your friends are gonna have a great time.
A pubescent herd of gabby wretches prattling on about boys and music and jellybeans and stickers...
Oh, we'd better stop by the hospital so I can get my cooties shot.
Meg, will you relax? None of us are gonna do anything to embarrass you.
Hey, any of you guys want a soda? I'm gonna go inside and get a soda.
Hey, Meg, it's Kevin from next door. I didn't know you worked here.
Hey, Kevin, come here. Come here! Say hi to Meg.
OK, I'd put Brad Pitt's face on Brendan Fraser's body with Ben Affleck's butt.
I'd take James Brolin's face, Mark Spitz's body, and Milton Berle's legendary genitals. Ah!
OK, truth or dare. Who here has gone all the way? Hm?
At my sleepovers, we used to practise French kissing. Now, everybody pair up.
All right, Meg, I need you to boil some water. Girls, I'm gonna need towels. Lots of 'em.
Look, I'll make it up to you. I'll get you Davy Jones for your school dance.
If you care about me, you won't show your faces for the rest of the night.
Look, I mean it. All of you. Oh, God, where's Stewie?
Well, Beth, what do you think? Does Mark find you attractive?
You ask me out to the box social or whatever the devil it is you children do these days.
God, your hand is like ice! Just here. Give it to me.
I wish there was some way I could make them understand how embarrassing they are.
Erica, you know I love you, but I gotta come clean.
Man, this is a great show. They drag these idiots up on stage and then blindside 'em.
Like this one guy, didn't know he was actually two midgets.
Today's guest is tired of being embarrassed by her family.
Whatever problems we have can be settled in the privacy of...
And we're back. Griffins, do you have anything to say to your daughter?
I can't believe you'd do this to us, Meg. Maybe now I won't give you the antidote.
You there, Bingo. It seems the naughty baby has made a messy-poo in his...
Look, what's the big deal? I mean, we're just a regular American family.
Man! That guy must've been wasted 24 hours a day, huh?
Yes. Yes. I say, do you have Prince Albert in a can?
What does that say under me? Oh, go yourself, Diane.
Peter, do you think there might be any validity to what Meg is feeling?
City Hall is burning! Don't worry. I'll put it out.
If you want an autograph, you either gotta give me a pen or get me some snow.
I look at you and I see a series. We would like to put cameras in your house and follow the drama that is your family. Kinda like The Real World.
All right! Then everyone'd get to see me and my wacky antics.
Yes, Chris. Your father signed a contract, and now we're gonna be on TV for the next six months.
How could you do this? You turned my life into the 24-hour Loser Channel.
You! Cameraman! Make sure you use that Cybill Shepherd filter.
If it makes her look half-human, it'll take six months off my face.
I... I find the toothpaste with a pump is a little easier to get on the brush.
Um... you might have noticed my underwear has a hole in it.
It's... you know... I don't see any reason to throw it out.
The waist is still fine, you know... You can see it's still real stretchy.
Dad's on TV parading around in his underwear like some gross European guy!
Oh, now, sweetie, your father is just a free spirit.
Here. A good breakfast is the foundation of a good day.
And a bad breakfast is the foundation of indigestion. Hey-oh!
What the hell is this? I said egg whites only!
Are you trying to give me a bloody heart attack? Make it again!
Frankly, I like the yolks. I don't... I have no problem.
It's just there's always been a lot of tension between Lois and me, and it's not so much that I want to kill her, it's just I want her not to be alive any more.
I sometimes wonder if all women are this difficult, and then I think to myself My God! Wouldn't it be marvellous if I turned out to be a homosexual?
One time my dad pooped in the neighbours' yard, then lied about it.
I knew it! Well, I'm glad I used his shovel to clean it up.
Wow! Joe, this sort of makes you like Larry from Three's Company.
Um, on Sundays we generally catch the early-bird special here at the Lobster Shanty.
Yes. That one looks like he's got some fight in him.
Oh, my God, it is them! I can't believe the Griffins eat here like everyday people.
Meg, honey, it's very cold in here. Maybe you'd be more comfortable with your bib on.
Meg, you're the one that got us on TV in the first place.
Well, now I am getting us off TV. I quit.
Why not? Our research shows that Meg is the least popular character on the show.
But everyone loves the rest of you. Lois, women 25 to 49 see you as a role model.
Look, the bottom line is you folks are still under contract, OK?
But I've come up with a solution I think will make everyone happy.
No cameras. The TV executives don't want viewers to be confused and think you're Meg.
I have an announcement. Meg Griffin's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors.
I'll be at Cleveland's house. I don't wanna be a part of this family any more.
We gotta go. The cameramen think we're taking Chris to soccer practice.
We're gonna be late! Why won't you talk to me?!
Oh, Meg, honey, our home is your home for as long as you like.
We could offer you the guest room, provided that it doesn't bother you that my Great Uncle Chet died in there.
We think sometime between The Tonight Show and The Today Show.
You know, some people think that dandelions are weeds, but, uh, you know, I always think... who the hell decided tulips were so great?
Uh, I don't know if Mom and Dad told you, but we usually have breakfast naked and I'm allowed to videotape it.
Ooh, my skin's getting so slippery. Hope I don't pop out of my top.
Hey, camera guy, check this out. Peter Griffin and Madame.
Hey! Hey, come back here! She's gonna sing Rainbow Connection!
No problem, Meg. You probably bought me another three minutes. Giggedy-giggedy!
I didn't make cheerleader because I'm so plain, and I still don't have a date for Friday night, as usual.
I'm going to write in my journal about how I'll never grow big, full breasts like these.
It's not fair. If I don't get any airtime, how am I ever gonna get my own spin-off where I'm a retired baseball umpire who opens a bar?
We don't get many of you molten-rock men in here.
To hell with the cameras. How could we ever let them replace our little girl?
Me too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother who isn't as good-Iooking or successful and never answers my letters, but he's still a Baldwin, dammit, and so is Meg.
Fire that sexy, interesting version of our daughter and make us a family again, or we walk.
I think it's awful and I don't much care for it at all, my good sir.
Well, you put me in a very awkward position, Peter, but I guess I have no choice.
And you're Fran Drescher. And you're, um, that fat guy from Boogie Nights.
Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here?
Oh, Peter, you promised me you wouldn't drink at the stag party.
This is terrible! We're the laughing stock of the town and we've lost our daughter.
Look, I don't care if you guys embarrass me. I wanna come home.
Hey, look at me! I'm a Christian! I'm reading the Bible!
And that was the last time I ever saw her.
Brian, I think we've stumbled on the root of your problems.
You have abandonment issues. Confront your mother and deal with this.
Are you crazy? My eyes were barely open and she just gave me away.
Brian, you really seem to be enjoying your wine lately.
Dad, if bad men broke into the house, and they had guns, and they put a gun up to your head and made you choose who you wanted to live, me or Meg, who would you choose?
Ask your mom. I'm not very good with tough decisions.
I could never choose. I love all my children equally.
It's hard enough having Stewie all the way in Palm Springs visiting Grammy and Grandpa.
Lois, uh... I was thinking. Why don't I fly out to Palm Springs and pick up Stewie?
Yeah. It's just what I need to clear my head.
That would be wonderful. It'll give me time to catch up on my reading.
Oh, don't even get me started. I... I... I... I mean, really!
When I think of... of... of... of the times that that woman has...
The infomercial said this tape will help us communicate better as a couple.
OK, Lois. I'll make you a deal. We'll watch the tape, but you gotta do something for me.
And Philadelphia Story Hepburn. None of that head-on-a-slinky Golden Pond stuff.
Wait here at the gate. I gotta run a quick errand.
Well, I... I think you're wrong, you increasingly attractive-Looking woman.
No, I'm serious. You could... you could be in magazines. You could!
I'm... I'm not drunk. I just have a speech impediment.
You were watching the boys again. It's that steward, the one who looks like Tab Hunter.
Forget it! Let's just get on the bloody plane and go home.
Call Lois, have her wire us some money and let's get out of here.
Oh, that's right. You have to punch in the numbers nowadays.
Lois? Damn. A way with words in marriage for couples who communicate not good.
Oh, come on, Lois. This is gonna be worse than when we had to watch your Uncle's Jerry's snuff film.
By purchasing this video, you've taken the first step towards strengthening your relationship.
I'd like to start by asking the women to leave the room, because this part of the tape is for men only. We'll see you in a little while.
So, you wanna talk or you want me to take my top off?
I hope you like big breasts because mine are so big, this itty bra can barely contain them.
You don't see the money till I see the stuff.
There's only one way to put an end to this nuisance.
Oh, come on, you. Get up. Come on! Go for a ride in the car.
Oh, my head. Oh, God. What are we doing here?
Open up, or I'll hit you with this blunt instrument
Well, it's not an instrument. It's more of an object.
And, well, it's kinda like a bat. I found it out back one day when I was raking.
We're trying to elude someone, not drive to soccer practice. Let's take this one.
This is the first place we've gone to. We should try another lot.
If Montgomery Clift, who was in From Here to Eternity with Burt Lancaster, who was in Atlantic City with Susan Sarandon, who was in White Palace with Kevin Bacon. There.
Nice, nice. Except that was James Spader in White Palace.
Yes. Well. I suppose I walked right into that one.
Brian! We were just on our way to the airport. Is everything OK?
Stewie and I traded in our plane tickets for train tickets.
$49.95? That's three times as much as the first one.
Lois, our relationship cannot be measured in nipples and dimes.
Get out! This is a part just for the men.
And if there's a pilot, there must be a bar. I can get a drink.
I don't trust you. You put your seed in my daughter's belly. You're fired.
You're lucky you're my brother too, or I'd kill you.
You can trust us completely. My friend is too young to put a seed in your daughter's belly
Boy, will your face be red when they find the black box on this one.
So saturate the soil twice a day. That's why my tomatoes haven't been coming in.
That was pretty good. But when you said Me llamo es Brian,  you don't need the es.
I have to find my mother and make peace with her.
All right. So instead of driving down this sun-parched highway, we've now got to walk.
I say, walk slower, dog. My Huggies are already holed up in Box Canyon.
Yes, and I bet you lost your virginity to a mechanical bull. Now change me!
Look, I've been thinking a lot about my mother lately, and...
Well, she probably wouldn't have wanted to see me anyway.
Brian, your momma gave you up because she thought you'd have a better life if she let you go.
Was she right, son? Do you have a good life?
We loved Biscuit so much, we wanted to keep her with us always.
I say, someone must have said a funny, because your mother's in stitches!
Come on, Betty, why don't we get these fellas some sandwiches?
You'd think those bulldogs would invite him to their card game.
This is actually a rather elegant solution for my problem of what to do with Lois.
Shut up and help me. I'm not leaving her here.
Oh, relax. Old girl doesn't have too much to wag about these days, anyway.
Hey, Meg. Try to guess the word I'm thinking of right now.
Oh, jeez, if she says Mrs Dash, I'm gonna lose it.
I know what you've been doing, and I'm very upset with you.
Wow. Usually beautiful women don't turn back into you until after I'm finished.
These tapes are about communication. If you wanted to see a woman acting nasty... you shoulda told me.
Lois! Ah, this is not what it looks like. She means nothing to me.
I'm gonna get directions to the nearest park so we can give my mother a proper burial.
Yea, and God said to Abraham you will kill your son Isaac.
And Abraham said I can't hear you. You'll have to speak into the microphone.
And God said Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better? Jerry, pull the high end out. I'm still getting some hiss back.
I never knew Biscuit as a dog, but I did know her as a table.
Yes, yes. Requiem and terra pax, and so forth. Amen.
I've read that starlight gives you cancer. Then again, what doesn't these days?
Listen, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. It's not easy for me to say.
Oh, God. You're not coming out of the closet, are you?
I just wanted to thank you for everything you did today.
I must admit there have been some moments that were, dare I say, fun.
At least I don't leave urine stains on all the household plants
We'd tell you more but we would have the censors on our ass
Like two college freshmen who were rejected by Harvard and forced to go to Brown.
God forbid you should have put a little eyeliner on for my homecoming.
Hey, kid! Thanks for not ratting me out. Is there anything I can do to pay you back?
Oh, yes. You remember that episode of The Brady Bunch where Bobby saved Greg's life,
It's on this afternoon. You can tape it for me. And put a nice label on it.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Recuerda si yo cierra la puerta de la garaje esta manana?
Dude, the Bronze Age was so much cooler than the Iron Age.
The Iron Age could kick the Bronze Age's butt any day of the week.
Ahh! I can see the air! And you know what else?
I finally get Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night.  It's a comedy that's too good to be funny.
In local news, a new drug craze may have Quahog students licked. It's called toad.
When licked, these toads trigger an intense psychedelic euphoria that's... that's just great.
This is awful. Now the drugs are in the schools?
He's back. Don't look at him, honey. Eat your potatoes.
Let's just pick up our plates and go eat in the hollow castle.
Believe me, you don't wanna mess with drugs. I tried 'em once-big mistake.
Peter, may I? You're walking down a hallway. You take a left. You keep walking.
Oh, now, don't you try to palm this off on your sister. She's a good girl.
Oh, yeah? What about the time she strangled our other sister?
Now, Chris, we told you that was just a very bad dream.
It's not mine. I was just holding it for a friend.
I guess Miss Wears-A-Hat-All-The-Time is gonna nark on us, aren't you?
What's going on back here? Oh, hello, Megan. Wait, you're not part of the popular clique.
Run along and play alone somewhere. Shame on you all, getting her hopes up like that.
I thought if I held Connie's toad, she'd make one of the cool guys ask me to the Snow Ball.
You're holding drugs so someone will invite you to a dance?
Hold on, Lois. People do a lot of crazy things just to be accepted.
We all did it. If you want to be a Supreme Court justice, you gotta pick up that cherry with your butt cheeks and drop it in that beer.
I can't believe he did that! This guy is so in!
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sure all the boys wanna ask you to the dance.
Yeah, I was terrified of askin' Phoebe Diamond to the prom.
I finally got up the guts, but I had this damn nervous twitch.
Uh, I was wonderin' if... if... if you'd, uh, d-do me the honour of, uh...
I had such a crush on her. Until I met you, Lois.
Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take to get to the centre of a Rhode Island state prison?
How could this happen? I thought we lived in such a nice small town.
There's no such thing. Things are different than when we were kids.
I mean, if Meg's at risk, then so is Chris, and Stewie'll be in preschool before we know it.
Well, we just have to trust our kids to stay off drugs.
I do trust our kids. It's the other kids I don't trust.
Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to us as parents to be a part of the solution.
And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd. So, are you with me?
But... you didn't tell me anything. You just sat down and said And that's my plan.
I love it! You have the faculty's full support. But how will you pull it off?
Hey, Meg. What's got four arms, four legs and one set of lips?
I've gone undercover to get rid of the toad problem, so your school can be safe and innocent like the good old days.
Negative B plus or minus radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A.
That's correct. A girl answered a math problem. You know what that means.
God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and this is all just a side effect from the chemo.
Say, Phil, what do you say to happy hour after work?
I'd say Cheryl's gonna have another black eye to explain to the neighbours.
No relation. So, tell me, homeboy, how 'bout the baggy clothes we kids are wearin'?
Hey, does anybody have any drugs? I'm lookin' to score some drugs.
I see. Well, I'm gonna have a little talk with that Connie.
Huh! Good luck. She only talks to the cool kids.
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Tiger house.
I got a carton of cigarettes. Old man grabbed me, said Hey, smoke up, Tony. They're grrreat! Bastard.
Everyone's talking about how you trashed the jukebox. Classic cool.
We never broke into song and dance before you arrived.
Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser, how come I'm going to the Snow Ball with Lando?
Meg, you got a date?! Oh, wait till I tell your mother!
This is great. Not only did I live long enough to see Meg go to her first dance, but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.
Dad never came to sing at my school. I don't want dessert!
I tell you, Lois, high school's a lot more fun this time around.
And it's a lot safer now that all the kids have guns. And today in study hall,
I farted real loud on purpose to make the guys laugh, and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie Johnson ralphed up her Salisbury steak.
I'm glad you taught those kids they don't have to do drugs to be popular.
He sure did! Who needs drugs when you go to the dance with the coolest guy in school?
Going with Dad is gonna skyrocket me up the popularity food chain.
It's true. Soon members of the math club will be attaching themselves to your underbelly.
Wait a minute. Peter, you can't take Meg to a school dance.
How long do you think you can keep up this charade?
Uh... uh, hold on. I'm gonna take this in the other room.
Mother, this could almost have passed for a palatable banana pudding, but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one of your wretched culinary abortions!
Neil, I'm a little out of your league. Besides, I'm going with Lando.
Really? My underground sources have informed me that Lando is taking Connie Demico.
Hey, I thought you were taking me to the dance!
Oliver Twit,  if you ask me. I would have done things rather differently, I can tell you that.
All right. Stop it. Stop it right there. Now, go on, fill up the bowl.
Hey. Hey, Brian, the guy who wrote this, his name? Charles Dickens.
Hey, Connie pulled a power move. When the most popular girl in school asks you to the dance, you don't say no, you say Haba-haba-haba... OK.
I can't understand why you'd dump your daughter for Connie Demico.
To Peter, Connie Demico is Phoebe Diamond, the most popular girl in his school.
When I try to speed things up in bed, I'm not thinkin' of Connie, I'm thinkin' of Phoebe.
This whole thing is ridiculous. I forbid you from goin' to that dance.
You can't tell me what to do. You're not my real mom!
You don't remember what it's like to be my age!
Greg Allman, how did you handle it when life got you down?
Me? I did a lot of drugs, married some broad named Cher... and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.
Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you. And, you know, you could still go to the dance.
Alone? Why don't I just tattoo a big L on my forehead while I'm at it?
If you stay home, you're just proving to the other kids that you don't belong there.
I'll tell you one thing. I still regret not goin' to my junior dance.
But, Daddy, if you don't do what they say, they'll kill me!
Well... I do have that really slutty dress you hate.
So, uh, Lando, how old did you say you were again?
Don't worry, I'll take good care of your kid. I got a daughter of my own, you know.
Please leave the light off. I don't want to be seen.
I convinced Meg to go to the dance, so I'm gonna go drop her off.
Because I've already explained that to you.  It was a scavenger hunt.
Lois, if you still haven't discovered I'm gone,  please flip the tape over to side B.
OK, everyone. The votes are in. This year's king and queen are...
Ri... No, no, no, to the left. No, no, you had her. No, no, go back, go back.
You got a monkey workin' the spotlight. No, to the right, genius. Th-there. Stop. Stop.
That's my dream girl. But I'm not good enough for her and she dumped me.
So now, heartbroken, I will ride recklessly into the night and up Dead Man's Curve.
And Lando Griffin,  a popular student at a local high school, was killed last night when his motorcycle careened off Dead Man's Curve.
Police were baffled when no body was found,  but they decided not to ask questions and just let everyone get on with their lives.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Now give me the other half of the amulet. I don't think you'll be making it to Marrakech.
Jeffrey, take the 9pm to Hounslow out of your mouth.
Oh, look at that. Our little boys are becomin' fast friends.
I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get the sifter so we can build our sand village.
Everyone, meet Jeffrey, the newest member of the club of forgotten children.
Steve walks warily down the street with his brim pulled way down low
Peter, I'm concerned about Stewie. He doesn't seem to play well with other children.
Oh, he's fine. You know, I was quite a troublemaker myself when I was a kid.
Your parents'll be home any minute. Are you sure you don't want me to clean up?
I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick, a can of beans and a pocketful of dreams.
Peter, do you even know which one of our children I'm talking about?
Abner! Abner! The Griffin boy just killed a plastic reindeer!
Gladys, it took me two hours to work up the courage to rent this porno.
Now, are you gonna watch it with me or not?
OK, Mommy's leaving you here for a while. Try to play nice with the other children.
What do you mean, you're leaving me here? What is this place?
This is a biogenetic experimentation facility, isn't it? Admit it!
Oh, sweetheart, don't be upset. You're gonna have fun here.
Look, if this is about the whole me-killing-you thing, it was a bit!
Oh! I'm so bored. Without Stewie around, I have nothin' to do.
Oh, it's too early for me, but you go ahead.
You know, before I was married, I led a very exciting life.
Oh, my God! The actress who was the girl in Escape from Witch Mountain!
Mom, you can't get a job. The last time you left Dad home alone, he turned the house into a giant puppet.
Uh... If you get a job, who's gonna feed me and protect me from the evil monkey in my closet?
The kids are growin', the nest is empty, and I need some excitement.
What are you talkin' about? Your life is plenty exciting. For example...
I say, does anyone know how The Practice ended last night? I dozed off.
Stewie, what have you done? That's not the way we play.
Really. Stop it. Stop your boohooing. Stop it, I say. Stop it!
You see? You see? This is exactly why people don't respect the WNBA.
Hey, guys, guys, get this. So Lois wants a part-time job, right?
So I'm, like, I got a job for you, baby... right here!
The zipper's been broken for over a month. I gotta use a damn safety pin.
If Lois is lookin' for a thrill, I could get her a job with the airline.
Stewardesses get to travel to exotic places, and their husbands fly anywhere for free.
Sorry, Tink. Looks like I don't need you any more.
So, what? You're just gonna dump me? Just like that?
A flight attendant? Wow, that does sound exciting. What made you change your mind?
Oh, Rupert, I can't sleep. I don't suppose you have any Valium on you?
No, of course not. You're living the clean life now. It's that pathetic little insect in daycare.
Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind at all. What the deuce has come over me?
Look at her, Leonard, sitting there with her curly ebony locks and those pouty come-hither lips. My God, she's unappealing.
Leonard, you pudgy-faced apple-john, I will not be made a fool of!
Is not, stupid head! And he keeps tryin' to take my apple juice.
That was beautiful. Hey, throw me a beer, would ya?
Stewardess, the plane just made my beer spill. I want a free one.
Sir, all your beers have been free. All nine of them.
Show me Morgan Fairchild in deep something. Huh? Huh? Huh?
Ah, you don't care. Hey, Frenchie, is my fort ready?
Yes, Mr Griffin, even though no one else has any pillows now.
So let it be known I want absolutely nothing to do with the wretched enterprise of love!
No, no, actually, it's Stewie, but, well, you can call me Cookie if you like.
Yes. I... Yes, I've also been known to answer to Artemis, Agent Buchwald and Snake.
Oh! Oh, you want my cookie? Oh, yes, by all means. Here you are.
Yes. Yes. Yes, you'II... you'll get that one halfway back to your mat. Ha! Ha... Oh, God.
Oh, Cupid, hast thou pierced me with thine sweet, searing arrow?
Argh! Unhand me, woman. I don't have gas, I'm in love!
Wake up, wake up, wake up. You need some lotion, Mr Bad Skin?
Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh! Agh!
You know, the usual. How about yours, my little sky princess? Bet it was excitin'.
Oh, yeah, if you like runnin' through a gauntlet of drunk, horny businessmen.
My ass feels like a pincushion. I'm thinkin' of quittin'.
What? Lois, you can't quit. What if Kurt Cobain had quit?
Well, I guess I'll give it a little more time. It's like I always tell the kids -
Yes. Yes, I suppose that was rather funny, wasn't it?
You know, it's odd, Janet, but when I'm with you, I... Oh, how do I describe it?
Ha! I said Will you be my wife? You said yes, so it is official. Let me touch your face.
OK. Everyone? It's time for my one-man show - Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye.
Would you like a crumpet? I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.
Would you like to wear knickers? I would, because I'm W...
This is my fourth trip today. Just this mornin' I went to Kentucky.
Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the way to Kentucky to get some fried chicken, and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?
My wife is a stewardess, so I can fly anywhere and I don't pay jack!
You convinced me to keep a job I hate just so you could fly free?!
If I talked real loud like that, I could make you look like the bad guy.
My feet are killing me, I've got vomit in my pocket and I've seen that crappy Julia Roberts movie 47 times!
Have you seen the lips on that woman? It's like a baboon's ass on her face!
Peter, I took this job for the excitement, and you're the one who's havin' it all!
Oh, it's excitement you want, huh? Well, how'd you like to join the Mile High Club?
Come on. You be the stewardess, and I'll be the mysterious stranger who's drillin' you.
Ugh! Move. I have a lot of work to do.
Well, Lois, at least one of us is in the Mile High Club.
Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over. The plane has safely landed in Cuba, and all Americans aboard are on their way home, except one couple - a fat man who is inexplicably married to an attractive redhead.
Here's an artist's rendering of what they might look like.
I called Brian. He's gonna watch the kids till we get back. When will our passports arrive?
We would have sent you with the others, but we didn't know you were stuck in the toilet.
You people aren't like the communists they show on TV.
I hear report cards vere handed out today. Vot were your grades?
Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies. There'll be dancing, Christmas mornings, and arguments over the proper way to discipline the children, and...
Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm the only one in this thing, I deserve to know.
This is great. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
We gotta get some fake passports on the black market.
Where are you going? You're never gonna find the black market.
I'm glad you changed your mind. But the point is, I found the guy.
Yes, it seems she's, um... Oh, what did we figure out, dear? Was it one? No, two. Yes.
She's two weeks younger than you. Just look at that butt. That is a tight butt.
This is what you call dolled up? Why don't you save yourself years of sexual ambiguity and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?
I should tell ya I promised my first girlfriend we'd meet up in heaven.
I was lyin', but just so you know it's somethin' we might have to deal with.
OK. Two American passports. Would you like to join the black market club?
But, you know, there is another way for you to travel.
It's over, Leonard. I suppose I should be grateful to that saucy harlot.
She taught me a valuable lesson. There's really no such thing as love.
It's just a word used by Madison Avenue to sell their skin creams and two-seater cars.
Argh! It's no use! She swims in my blood now. I must have her!
Darling, why are we tormenting ourselves? We're perfect for each other.
I admit we've got our problems, like any couple, but true love conquers all!
Oh! Oh, well, it's not love, but it's a start.
Oh, Janet, you've made me the happiest man in the whole world.
You don't care about me. It's my cookies! It's always been the damn cookies!
You'll have to get your fill somewhere else, you oatmeal-raisin-Ioving tart!
Don't let her see you cry, old man. Don't let her see you cry.
I'm sorry I tricked you into that job, honey. You deserve to have a more excitin' life.
Oh, Peter, bein' married to you gives me all the excitement I can handle.
I mean, look at us-on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, under the moonlight, surrounded by refugees.
Miguel over there has had his eye on you, and his wife Rosa is very open.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Wakey, wakey, worthless domestic. Time to make the inedible gruel.
Mommy wants to rest for a few more minutes, honey.
Whaddaya doin' lyin' on the couch at this hour? You been drinkin'?
Peter, I'm exhausted. I've been in and outta taxis all day.
Stewie had a doctor's appointment, then I had to pick Meg up after school.
I had rehearsal for Death of a Salesman,  but we can't show death at school, so now at the end, we dance around with sparklers.
Trying to do all these errands in a taxi is exhausting.
Oh, but you meet such colourful characters in taxis, like Alex Rieger and Tony.
Rieger, cab 402. Nardo, you and your luscious melons are in 315.
Peter, please. I saw an ad for a used car that would be perfect.
Oh, no, Lois. A guy at work bought a car outta the paper. Ten years later, bam! Herpes.
I'm buying our car from a dealer and that's that.
Peter, look at this one. It's safe and reliable and we can afford it.
Hey, I'm Doug, nice to meet ya. Whoa, have you lost weight?
Ha! Well, I'm sure the dealer will take care of it.
There's no way we can have maritals with you lying all the way over there.
OK, so I tried on your bra. Jeez, the fellas were puttin' on a show.
I didn't think I'd make a good Gigi either, but, God help me, I was flattered.
Ha! You're just mad about the car. Don't worry. I'll think of a way to fix it.
I'm tired of being left out of all our decision making.
Hey, Peter, you want a menu, or just the usual everything?
Lois has had the car all week and it's just been hell gettin' around.
All because I can't afford to get our new car fixed.
I'm just sayin' that me and my associates will steal your car, and ipso facto your insurance company'll buy you another one.
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
You can jot it down on the back of my gun.
Ah, crap. I made a mistake. Do you have another gun?
Dharma, come down from there. Wow,  I can't get over what a free spirit you are.
Lois, can you go down to the basement and do somethin' really loud and complicated for the next 15 minutes?
Look, Lois, we had a broken car, I did something, and now we have a new car.
Well, the important thing is it matters to you. And that's the greatest gift of all.
Hey, Cleveland, check out my on-board computer navigation system. Standard.
That's fancy an' all. But I think you're bargainin' for more than you can chew.
You're in debt to the Mob. That means they can ask you to do anything.
No, no. I mean, am I George Carlin funny, am I Spin City funny, Rita Rudner funny, what? Come on.
I guarantee ya, I am never gonna hear from those guys again.
Peter, it is time to repay your favour to the don.
What kind of a guy... what's he like? Is he a friendly don?
I have asked you here tonight so that you may perform a service.
Whaddaya gonna make me do? Whack a guy? Off a guy? Whack off a guy?
Silence. Big Fat Paulie's in town this week to attend the wedding of my daughter.
You want me to shoot him twice in the head.
That's sweet of you to ask, but he's my nephew.
No one's been able to stand Big Fat Paulie's company for more than a minute.
But you, Mr Griffin, you will take him to the movies.
That's it? That's all I have to do? Ah, thank Go... Wait a second. Which movie?
Because if it's anything with Greg Kinnear, you can just whack me off right now.
The name's Marty, and I'm very sensitive about my weight.
Oh, uh... I was only supposed to go to a movie with ya.
That'd be better than having dinner with my family who I love and am not afraid of.
You can't just bring company home at the last second without calling.
I am gettin' tired of you doin' everything without consultin' me. And...
As a matter of fact, I do, you crazy broad.
Oh, no, no, Lois. He didn't mean you're crazy like Elizabeth Taylor.
You know, he meant you're crazy like... like that glue. You stick to things.
You have a pretty good appetite there, kid. I bet you spend a lot of time in the john.
Sorry, what finishing school did you say you went to?
Yes, good heavens. Who taught you how to eat? Mickey Rourke?
Why do I know that name? Damn you, Entertainment Tonight!
Hi, I'm Bob Goen,  and these are Mary Hart's legs.
Mary, you recently spent some time with Julia Roberts, didn't you?
Hey, son, how'd you like to be a coke mule?
He's not the kind of person I want hangin' around our family.
That man is bad news. I want him out of our house and out of our lives.
Ever stare at the night sky and wonder if someone might be lookin' back at ya?
No, but just in case... Look at this, you freakin' aliens!
This is my friend, Big Fat Paulie, and, uh... this is his big fat ass.
Aw, jeez. It's not you, it's Lois. She doesn't want me hangin' around with ya.
If only I'd met you first... But whaddaya gonna do?
She just doesn't wanna see me fall in with a tough crowd again.
We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
So, if she wasn't around, we could still be friends, right?
Willy Loman never made a lot of money, his name was never in the paper, but, uh... You know, like, attention could be paid.
Jeez, come on, everybody. I know it sucks, but they're just kids.
Aw, come on, Lois. The only victim tonight was the work of Arthur Miller.
Whaddaya mean, you thought she'd be six feet under and we'd be able to catch a movie?
It's not too late to have the hit called off?
How could you bring a mobster into your own home?
If you're upset now, wait till ya hear the rest.
I was talkin' to Big Fat Paulie the other day and one thing led to another, and...
That's not even the worst part. Wait. Yeah, it is.
We'll move to England. Worst they got there is, uh, you know, drive-by arguments.
I say, Jeremy, isn't that Reginald B Stiffworth, the chap who's been touting the merits of a United European Commonwealth?
Whichever bunny you think is better for shooting a guy in the head.
I've been lookin' all over for ya. Look, I gotta call off the hit on my wife.
Peter, there is no such thing as the Mafia. The don's daughter is getting married tomorrow. Here's my invitation. Now, get the asterisk, percent, ampersand, out of here, you SOB.
Boy, what a mismatched pair. A free spirit and a puppet.
It's not that perfect. We'll probably have to buy a gift.
And you know how bad I am at buyin' gifts.
Didn't you see The Godfather?  The don can't refuse a favour on his daughter's wedding.
Peter, I don't know how to explain it any clearer than that.
No way, it's too dangerous. I got you into this and I'll get you out of it.
No, Peter, when we got married we agreed to share our lives.
Yes, because together we can do anything, face any foe, overcome any obstacle.
Yeah, climb any mountain, rent any video, dial any phone.
Decent phones, God-fearing phones, phones that everybody else gave up on, but we knew better, because we were a team.
I don't know. What if somethin' happens to ya? I'm too old to start dating again.
OK, bachelor number one. I'm an ice-cream cone. How are you gonna eat me?
I'd invite my friend Rudy over and the two of us would give you a double dip.
I'd lick off all the cream and give you my special whip topping.
Well, I would try to eat you really fast, before I got flaccid.
I'll be fine. All we have to do is blend in.
Peter, my good friend. How good of you to come and show your respect, on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
Yeah, sorry I didn't bring a gift, but the stores were mobbed.
Listen, Your Don-ness. I got a little favour to ask.
Go ahead. I am obligated to grant one favour on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
While you ask me for this one and only favour,
I will sit here and enjoy this very fine tiramisu.
You know what? Here. It's yours. No, no, really. I insist.
Peter, I'm gonna be killed. Does that mean nothing to you?
My daughter, what is the problem on this, the day of my daughter's wedding?
Hey, it's my job, all right? This is what I do.
You two should stop fighting and listen to each other.
See, marriage is a partnership. If you really love someone, you gotta work together, as a team. I... I learned that the hard way.
I didn't listen to what my wife had to say and now she's as good as dead.
We won't have to. I don't believe this. She's the one I'm supposed to whack.
Look, I love my wife more than anything in the world.
Such tenderness and love on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
Wait. We're a team. Is that OK with you? Because your opinion matters too.
Yes, let's get the hell outta here. Thank you for a lovely time.
Ah, nice kid. Well, I think I handled that pretty good.
Oh, my! Tomatoes are 3.99 a pound. That's so high!
This is interminable! I demand to know why you insist on taking me everywhere you go!
I mean, what could possibly happen if you left me home by myself?
Hm. Instant stuffing or instant mashed potatoes? The choices are...
You're not a shoplifter. You're just a fat kid. Sorry about that, fatty-fat-fatty.
Hey, Tom, he's just a fat kid! Aren't you, fatty? You're just a big old fat kid.
Agh! Sorry, Dr Ling, I guess I'm nervous. This whole thing is a little weird.
Never ye fear. I've been doin' this all me life.
See, the reason your fleas are drawn to you is your kidney energy is bein' blocked by a dark chi, or what we call in my country wee-fung-chow-hu.
You have to keep those two boxes right next to each other?
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Attention, world leaders. I have 137 nuclear warheads trained on every capital city around the globe.
The world is now under my control. But oh, no! I'm naked!
Wake up, Leona! This decrepit Hooverville is infested with something besides idiots!
Oh, my God! Stewie, you've got bugs on your jammies! Peter, wake up.
Oh, that's nothin'. When I was a kid I was covered with ticks.
Time for doggie to go the way of Old Yeller.
OK? I'm covered in fleas, lady. I'm losin' it here.
There's only one thing to do-learn the language of the fleas, earn their trust, then breed with their women. In time our differences will be forgotten.
He just watched his wife and kid get carried away by seven million fire ants.
I don't wanna meet the man who looks good after that.
What do we do now? What the hell do we do now?!
I feel terrible about this. Why don't I put us up in a nice hotel for a couple of days?
That's a great idea, Brian. It'll be like a little vacation.
Well, you might wanna bring some cash, cos some places don't take credit cards.
But mister, I need real money. I can't take a credit card.
Oh, I see. Cash only, huh? No paper trail. What are you sellin'? Reefer? Crack?
Smack? Horse? X? Shrooms? Dust? Meth? In my neighbourhood? I don't think so!
Oh, my. What a lovely room. Oh, and it's so clean.
The ultraviolet scanning light will be the judge of that.
I picked this up on Dateline from that yummy exoskeleton Maria Shriver.
This must be where Wilford Brimley was strangled by Bob Crane.
Jump in, honey. Don't be afraid. The turtle will keep you safe.
Oh, for God's sake! I'm to entrust my life to a turtle, nature's D student? Agh!
This is marvellous! I feel like a young Johnny Weissmuller!
No, you can't swim with your shirt on. Wait a second. What are you hidin'?
Do you have bruises? Did somebody hit you? Lois, what did you do to my son?
If I wanted to embarrass him, I'd do somethin' like this.
Hey! Hey, everybody! Hey, look what Chris Griffin's father Peter Griffin's doin'!
Stop it! Chris, why don't you want to take your shirt off?
Sir, you can't park your van on the diving board.
Hey, Tom! He's not a van! He's just a fat kid!
Don't listen to him, Chris. I'm gonna go get you a soda. You wait here.
I say, hello! You there! I'm ready to get out! Somebody!
You're not fat, Chris, you just come from a long line of husky Griffins, like your great-great-great-uncle Jabba the Griffin.
Honey, if you wanna lose weight, I'll put you on a diet and your father can help you exercise.
Stick your finger down your throat and throw up till you're skinny.
Don't listen to your sister. Stickin' your finger down your throat doesn't make you throw up.
Meat loaf for us, and a very special, very delicious steamed vegetable dish for Chris.
It tastes like a monkey. A monkey that's past its prime.
It's too bad you can't have some - it's practically orgasmic!
OK, Chris, time for some good old-fashioned exercise-like those guys are doin'.
I say, Phineas, great day to be doing squat thrusts and lifting our huge triangular iron weights.
Dad, I don't like running. The sound of my thighs scraping together hurts my ears.
Come on! You can do it. Feel the burn, Chris. Feel the burn.
OK, just relax. Try to soil yourself, like we practised.
I tell ya, he's been workin' out all week and he hasn't lost a pound.
Peter, if you're this desperate about Chris's weight, why don't you just suck the fat out?
If you can find a hole on the boy that you wanna put your lips on, be my guest.
I'm talkin' about liposuction. My brother Broderick's a cosmetic surgeon.
Well, Nell Carter used to be twice as big before Broderick got through with her.
FYI, he used the fat he took out of her to make the two kids from Good Burger.
This is a very safe procedure, son. You won't feel a thing.
I'm like a Green Beret, you know. I sneak inside you and I skulk around like it's Vietnam or somethin', and I'm sneakin' through the bush, you know.
And I get all that fat, like the fat's my buddies stuck behind enemy lines, you know.
And when I got all my buddies, I sneak out again.
I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you, you know, like a... like the wind, you know.
Oh, good boy, Stewie. Clean plate. Although I think you got...
Yes, yes, I got more of it on me than in me. Yes, that one never gets old, Lois.
I'm ready. Well, time for dessert, isn't it? Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie, and we have something very tasty for big fat you. Bon apptit!
Oh, and feel free to use my fork, I shan't be needing it. Watch me.
We should cut down on your sweets-you're gettin' a belly. Chris, where have you been?
Dad took me to a doctor to get the fat vacuumed out of my belly.
I mean, what kinda lazy, narcissistic, irresponsible moron would even consider doing something as unbelievably foolish as getting liposuction? Who, I ask you? Who?
He's become so massive he's collapsed into himself like a neutron star.
Peter, you can't just suck 200Ibs of fat out of yourself. It's not natural.
Come on. Lois, I feel great droppin' that kind of weight all at once.
You know, there's somethin' I always wanted to do, Brian, but, uh... I-I could never do it cos I was so heavy.
But, you know, now that I don't weigh so much, I think I can.
I was wonderin' if I could put a little saddle on your back and ride you like a horsy.
Oh, OK. No, I understand. It's too much. It's OK.
I like Hillary Clinton, I don't care what anyone says. Argh!
Why not? It's totally safe. A lot of famous people have done it.
Your place is here in the ice village. You know nothing of Hollywood and its ways.
But, Father, I have dreams and courage and the name of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.
Fear not, some day word will reach you about the success of me, the great Eskimo actor Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Plastic surgery is great! I was thinkin' about havin' Broderick take a look at my nose.
It doesn't matter if your nose is a little bulbousy, or your eyes are too close together, or your chest is flabby. You are who you are.
Hey, pal, you can't just walk in here... Holy crap, it's Peter.
Oh, this is crazy. You walk in here with your chiselled jaw and your...
I liked you the way you were. You're not even real any more. You're...
I had to. My old one had a crack in it.
You... you've really let this family down. We should be embracin' the things God gave us, not tellin' our kids a person's not as good as someone else because of the way they look.
If you touch it, the mother won't take it back.
Excuse me, sir, what is a handsome man like you doing waiting in line?
Warren Fredericks, Quahog Beautiful People's Club. Come on in front.
Gorgeous guys like us don't have to wait. Haven't you noticed?
Hi. I'm on a scavenger hunt, and I need a human foot.
Well, as a rule, I would say no, but OK, come in.
Raul, please take this handsome gentleman's bags to his car.
It opened because you stepped on that black rubber square.
If that wasn't there, it would've opened anyway cos you're beautiful.
This is the Beautiful People's Club, and you're our newest member.
Here's your introductory basket. It's got lotions, Ferrari sunglasses, and pills to make your bowel movements smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.
Serves you right. You tried to make Chris jealous, now you have an eating disorder.
I would, but my doctor advised me against heavy lifting.
What the... What the devil are you doing? Stop it! Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!
Did you paste a new picture of yourself on our wedding portrait?
I'm goin' to the Beautiful People's Club. I can take him with me.
Seein' us all might give him somethin' to shoot for.
The Beautiful People's Club? How come I never heard of it?
Lois, I can't say any more. I'm probably already in trouble for mentioning it to a, uh...
That wasn't a sentence. You were ogling Peter like a horny schoolgirl.
Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know, he's become a superficial, egomaniacal jerk.
But I've never been more attracted to him. Does that make me a bad person?
Peter, good to see you. I've got a lot of tall, statuesque people I want you to meet.
Well, let me tell you somethin', buddy. If my son can't come in, then I'll just come in.
Trust me, Chris, sometimes it's better not to fit in.
You're all stupid. They're gonna be lookin' for army guys.
How could you treat Chris that way? You know he's self-conscious about his weight.
What you gettin' mad at me for? He gets his fat from your genes.
Why don't you have that doctor suck the fat outta your head?!
Maybe I will. Then I'll put it on my feet and skate on Paul Bunyan's giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!
Damn you, ice cream. Come to my mouth. How dare you disobey me?
She is so jealous. Of course - I'm beautiful. I mean, look at me.
Well, Mr Griffin, the bandages are ready to come off.
But I should tell you it's a miracle you're alive at all.
We did all we can, but medical science has come just so far.
And now I will take off this protective Potato Head mask.
I can't believe you're all still standin' by my side after what a jerk I was.
Well, Peter, I guess you learned a pretty valuable lesson.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
OK, OK. Here's another riddle. A woman has two children.
A homicidal maniac tells her she can only keep one.
What'd you do, sell your body to science? You know, I've thought of doin' that.
All right, uh, Jenny, would you come up here and show us where the femur is?
I spent my refund on a digital TV with surround sound.
It's got headphones, so I can watch Steven Seagal movies without waking Bonnie.
Yes! Lock and load! Lock and load! Bring on the pain!
And by special, I don't mean special like that Kleinerman boy down the street.
If you said mallard and you had a cold, it would sound like Ballard.
You know, Rupert, the word gullible is not in the dictionary.
Oh, oh, you don't believe me? Here! Look it up!
Everybody, my tax refund is here. I'm gonna buy us somethin' we've always wanted.
Uh, Peter, there's a T in there. That says audit.
No, Brian, it's a foreign car. The T is silent.
The IRS is much kinder and gentler than we used to be.
You can write off medical stuff? If I'd known, I wouldn't have used a discount surgeon.
Uh, I'm not sure which one to cut here. The red one... or the blue one...
First, why don't you attach that green one to that purple one?
I was afraid of that. Try the green and blue.
Well, Mr Griffin, you don't owe any additional money, but unfortunately, you're not entitled to a refund.
I'm sorry. I still haven't gotten over the loss of Party of Five.
It'll take time to get over it. What were you sayin'?
No, that was for my refund. What the hell's Party of Five?
By God, I may not be able to give my family a vibrating sex doll,
If you find a human skeleton with a Lincoln Log jammed in the temple, I didn't do it.
But I need that log for my recreation of James Madison's cabin.
OK, kids, I don't want anyone swimmin' in this pool unless there's a lifeguard on duty.
Oh. Oh. You know, honey, you don't have to do this.
Maybe a pool is another one of those things a family doesn't really need.
See, that's what I do. I ask for a snack and I blow the horn.
You bastards come into our village and kill our fish, pollute our water.
I'm gonna send you back to hell where you belong.
I've fixed the power line, but the town's zoning laws prohibit building a pool there.
Oh, yeah? Well, your eyes are too close to your nose.
I only have to wear one goggle when I go swimming in my pool!
Damn government, telling me I can't build a pool on my own land.
After my grandfather helped create one of our most beloved cartoon characters.
OK. We've narrowed it down to two possible names. All in favour of Bugs Bunny?
No, I'm Peter Griffin. Oh, you're here about your pool.
I'm here to serve the fine citizens of Quahog. It'll be my pleasure to give you a permit.
I've never encountered anything like this, but your property doesn't seem to be on the map.
What the hell are you talkin' about? I've lived there for 12 years.
Sorry, but according to this map, you're not even part of these United States.
Would you come back in a week, when my fat malcontent trap door will be completed?
What's going on? Did the city give you the permit?
No, no. We're not part of this city. We're not even part of this country.
Thanks to a technicality, we have the right to secede from the US.
From this day forth, this territory will be known as Petoria!
I was going to call it Peterland, but that gay bar by the airport took it.
A new foreign country which was founded this week, here in our own back yard.
And in a Quahog News 5 Exclusive, we sent our own little foreigner,
Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, to Petoria, where first lady Lois Griffin has graciously agreed to give a tour of her country. Tricia.
Thank you, Diane. So, Mrs Griffin, what's it like being the woman behind the man?
Ah, you know, when Peter first said we were our own country, I was a bit sceptical.
Then I thought Hey! I could be like Hillary Clinton! Only, you know, without the penis.
My son Chris is in charge of our space programme.
Oh, Peter. That tickles me in a way that if Loretta tickled me in that way,
What are you talkin' about? I'm a born leader. Like my great-great-uncle Ulysses S Griffin.
All right. No more slaves. But we still don't have to read books.
You still owe me for the other rounds, which comes to 50 bucks.
You think G Gordon Liddy paid for his drinks while he was stranglin' people with piano wire for the good of our nation?
Peter, you can't drink that outside. You're gonna end up in jail.
Go back and pay the bill, Peter. You, uh, don't wanna break the law.
I can riot, loot, not give a hoot, and touch your sister's teat
Stop! Peter time! I'm a big shot, there's no doubt
Don't care if you're handicapped, I'll still park in your spot
It's Peter, go Peter, up Peter, yo, Peter, let's see Regis rap this way, can't touch me
Attention, delegates. This session of the United Nations is hereby convened.
Man, this sucks. Hey, Podium Guy! Hey, I got a problem here.
I'm stuck up here in the nosebleeds. I'm president of Petoria. I want a better seat.
Oh, of course. How could we not have recognised the great nation of Petoria?
And hey! Would you also like a special satellite to scratch your ass with a laser beam from space?
I used to be the laughing stock around here until my country invaded Kuwait.
The only way to get any respect around here is to find something you want and just take it.
Wait. If everybody respects you, how come you're eatin' by yourself?
Oh, this is the newest province of Petoria. I call it Johio.
What? You can't just come over here and annexe my pool.
Oh, yeah? Well, according to paragraph seven, sentence three, word eight of the Geneva Convention, the.
A military strike against such a small nation could cause an international backlash.
Well, I guess the world'll show me a little more respect now.
Dad, I tried to got to school but this guy won't let me.
The scene outside the US-Petorian border as the sun rises on day one of Operation Desert Clam.
Good morning. I'm Diane Simmons. We now go to Tom Tucker, live at the site of the US blockade. Tom?
Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front, where the US has cut off electricity, water and gas to the tiny four-bedroom republic.
Oh, my God, they've opened fire. It looks like things are getting very heated here.
We can't bathe, we can't do laundry, there's no heat...
It's not for ever. You know, it's just... it's just... You know.
Peter, I'm up here. Oh, sweetie, maybe you should go over to Joe's and return his pool, huh?
No. We're a real country. We deserve all the rights and privileges everyone else gets.
But we have to think about the welfare of our children.
I just think you should... Peter, stop starin' at my chest.
And we're back with our round-table discussion on the Petorian crisis.
What the United States is doing to Petoria right now is criminal.
Nonsense! Force is the only thing a despot like Peter Griffin understands.
Oh, it's ridiculous, clearly. He's a factory worker, not a despot.
You're missin' the point. Our blockade is turnin' Petoria into a Third World country.
Can anybody tell me what the square root of the hypotenuse is... Chris, is that a note?
Would you like to read it for the rest of the class?
Damn you, Rupert! Keep these loathsome insects away, or you'll end up like Mr Giraffe.
A lot of you know me as Tim Robbins' mother. But I'm actually his girlfriend.
For less that the ticket price of one of my movies about capital punishment or neo-feminism, you can make sure that Stewie never goes hungry again.
Yes, and from the look of those sweater cows, so can you.
Look at what we're reduced to. Our own baby has to use newspapers for diapers.
My God, I haven't seen everyone this miserable since that time we were tortured.
I'm sorry. Were you just whipping me? Or did I just get bit by a mosquito?
Hey, Lois, if you happen to see the dungeon master, tell him his grandmother was tryin' to work me over.
It's time to call this whole thing off. Nobody's on our side.
Are you nuts? Look at all these telegrams. Nice goin'. Libya. You the man! North Korea. Great job! Iraq.
Iraq, Lois! You know what? I'm gonna invite a few of these fellas over for a party.
See, Lois, I told you we had allies. Hey, Slobodan. You made it.
I didn't know what to bring, so I made coleslaw. It's made out of people!
That show is so funny. It really reminds me of me and my friends, how we hang out before I kill them for worshipping the wrong god.
And I love that Kramer guy. He comes in the room like this: Whaaaa... Well, I can't do it, but you know.
Manuel, do you want... Can you ask him if he wants cheese?
I say, I say, Achmed. What is that thing you people do when you're about to assassinate an infidel?
I've had enough. You can keep this filthy mess you call a country. Come on, kids.
This is treason! For God's sake, Peter! Make an example of her!
Nothing says Obey me like a bloody head on a fence post.
Ah, I guess it's you and me against the world, buddy.
Attention, President Griffin. As you may presently, yourself, fully be aware of, my grammar sucks, but more importantly,  we're about to commence
The guy who thinks up the names is on vacation. Fire!
The guy who aims is in the john. Ah, here he is. Next one's comin' right at you.
Face it, it's over. Why not sit down with the mayor and negotiate some kind of treaty?
Negotiate? Peter Griffin doesn't know the meaning of the word negotiate.
Can... can I tie you to a stick and use you as a white flag?
Thank you all for coming. We invited Jesse Jackson to open our negotiations with a prayer.
Unfortunately, he couldn't make it, so in his place we have LaToya Jackson.
OK. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to make a concession or two.
You mean this cheap little pen we have millions of back at the office?
Oh, man. So after all this I end up with nothin'?
How about this? Every night when you get home from work,
I'll scratch your back with a matchbook cover like you like.
And that's the story of Petoria, a little nation that, 200 years ago, seceded and repatriated in less than a week.
So, like, can the family understand the baby, or... or... What's the deal with that?
Have you ever had to tell a lie in order to keep a friend?
Well, the other day I told Jane her blouse was pretty when it was really pee-ew.
Look, sometimes it's better to tell a little fib than to hurt someone's feelings.
Funnier than the one where Anus got the hamster stuck in his mouth.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Ah, the old alma mater. I tell you, there's something magical about Brown.
Oh, I haven't been on a college campus in years.
If you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears that would ring a bell.
Yes, this is Meg Griffin. She's here to see the dean of admissions and we'd, uh, like it if she got into the university.
This one time the National Guard came and shot some of my friends.
Um... the recent campus sporting event was most disappointing for our side, wasn't it?
Oh, aren't you adorable? Are you in a fraternity, little boy?
Not yet, but I'm thinking about joining I Phelta Thi.
I say! It's like the spice rack in my fantasy kitchen!
Hold on, little fella! This is just for big people.
But the shelf life of that Sodium Pentothal is only two years and...
Blast! This isn't the first time I've been thwarted by my small stature.
OK, our next lot is number 15 in your programme.
It's got the power to enslave the entire human race. Do we have an opening bid?
It can enslave the human race. Come on. It's solid titanium.
Well, let's take a look at your transcript. Meg. Hm.
It's just three letters. It's hardly a name at all.
I wanted to call her Twiki. But Lois said kids now wouldn't get the reference.
I'm not sure you're Brown material. Don't you have any extracurricular activities?
Well, I'm president of the Luke Perry fan club, Quahog chapter.
But I've wanted to go to Brown ever since I was a little girl.
Well, actually, I really wanted to go to Wellesley but Mom said I might as well buy hiking boots and call myself a lesbian right now.
I have no future! I'm just gonna wait in my room until I'm dead.
If Meg doesn't get into college, who knows what future she'll have?
Come on. There's gotta be a hundred clubs at your school.
Uh, well, I do have a friend on the school newspaper.
Lois, I challenge you to a race around the world.
I'm looking for something like the spread in last month's Vanity Fair.
I'm just joshing. It's all done on Xerox. What can I do you?
Look, Neil, I need an activity to get into Brown. The paper is my last hope.
You never seem to be that interested in journalism-or journalists, such as myself.
You know, I never realised how smooth the skin between your acne is.
OK, I'll give you a shot. I've never been able to get an interview with the mayor.
Run, little rabbit, run. But some day our two worlds will be one.
Listen to me. My entire future is in your hands.
Well, well, Mr Toilet. I thought you were in the Hamptons.
You seize life by the throat and shake it like a topless bartender mixing a martini.
If I were big, oh, just think where I would be.
Tired of not being able to find clothes that fit? I know I was.
That's why I started Stewie's Big and Tall Man Shop. If you're portly or tall, you'll find a friendly atmosphere brimming with personalised and expert service.
If I could build a device to harness the size of that leviathan, there's no limit to what I could... Oh, my God, there's an orgy in my mouth. Got milk? That's a funny one too.
Oh, and, uh I got ya, diagonally. Pretty sneaky, sis. That one's also funny.
Mayor West, you've been talking for an hour and I don't have anything I can use.
They're crafty, I tell you. It happens when you least expect it.
Show yourself, damn you! I've been investigating him for months.
It's cost $150,000 of the taxpayers' money but I'll find the culprits if it costs me a million.
Well, thank God she's just a figment of my imagination.
Well, let's take the old boy out for a spin. Eyes open!
He was gone for the day so I left it on his desk.
Oh, my God. Corruption in City Hall. This is amazing.
This'll never get Meg on the paper. This is old news.
Oh, hold on. Honey, let's get all the kids in this.
I know kids, and this story's gonna put 'em to sleep.
Meg needs something that'll pull those kids away from their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots and their Spirographs and their Moby Grape and their 90210.
Now, to get this story on the school editor's desk is gonna take a portion of my cunning.
Congratulations, Meg. This is the most sensational story we've ever had.
I'm just reading every high-school newspaper in America to see if I'm mentioned.
A lot of these famous types lead secret lives we don't know about. Like Ricky Martin.
I just wanted you to have something to put on your transcript.
Thanks to you I can put that I'm a big liar who makes up stories about people.
It worked for Walter Cronkite... You know that Vietnam thing? Never happened.
Don't mention it at the veterans' hospital. Those guys are committed to the lie.
Aw, don't cry, sweetheart. I'll make it up to you.
Well, I bought him and I've been saving him for a time like this. Surprise!
Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy but I can't help feeling like this is somehow my fault.
No, it's Luke Perry's fault. If he were gay Meg would be all set.
Brian, that's it! If I could get a picture of Luke Perry doing something gaylike it'll make people believe Meg's story is true!
Hey, I've gotten people to believe crazier things. And if you are pure of heart and deed you'll all go to a beautiful place called Heaven.
I require a hand-operated buzz saw capable of cutting through a human sternum.
Oh, blast! What the devil do they study? Uh... Latin class.
Uh, sorry, kid. I can't sell power tools to minors.
Look here, you gourd-bellied codpiece. Allow me to purchase the provisions I demand or I shall transform your blue collar into a red one and...
Who the deuce are you? No, I don't have any spare change.
Where the hell would I keep it? In my diaper? Get outta here, you hobo!
All right, now, we gotta be very crafty so Luke Perry doesn't recognise us.
How is he gonna recognise us? He doesn't know who we are.
OK, as soon as I seduce him get ready to snap the picture.
Listen, Brian, I'd take a bullet for Meg so I'm sure I can take a... Here he is.
Gee, the sun seems really strong, even for my already-bronzed skin.
Oh, my muscles are all... Look, they're all shiny with oil.
But how am I ever gonna spread it on my rippling back and thighs?
Ah, this is gonna take drastic measures. All right, get the camera ready. Oh, Luke!
They have been ever since they first came here from France.
I can't even say my name without people asking me if I made it up.
He was doing it for you. He knows how much you want to go to Brown.
There's no way I'm gonna get in now. I'm a felon.
It's a civil matter. Don't worry. Your father will straighten everything out.
Come on. Let's go get our nails done. Chris, take care of Stewie.
That scene where you wanted to get on the plane and that dumb guy was screaming.
Every time I see that lame-o actor I put your head on his body.
Thanks. It's nice to meet someone who appreciates my work.
Come to my house so I can take a picture of you in a gay pose.
Dark Side of the Moon synchs up with The Wizard of Oz.
Really? Shannen Doherty told me that but I thought she was just being a bitch.
Oh, God! I'm sorry. You know what's good for getting wine out?
But I am not. And even if I was... Come on, I'm Luke Perry.
I can get a much better gay guy than you.
See, Meg? I told you your father would explain about the article.
This is all my fault. I was just trying to help my daughter get onto the school newspaper.
Ah, what the hell. But, hey, you gotta print the real story.
And this time I wanna talk to the real reporter.
Things work out if you do whatever you want without worrying about the consequences.
Thanks, Daddy. Come on, Luke. I got my computer in my room.
I wanted to give you a copy of my daughter's article.
If I do this, do you promise to stop stealing my water?
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Hey, guys. Guys, check it out. Quagmire's tryin' to get lucky.
We interrupt for breaking news. After years of isolation, the mysterious and eccentric brewmeister, Pawtucket Pat, has said that he's opening his never-before-seen brewery to a lucky few.
Pawtucket Pat has placed four silver scrolls in four random beers.
Each lucky scroll winner and a guest of their choice will take a magical tour of the brewery, and walk away with a lifetime's supply of beer.
What? Don't complain. This is actually makin' you look attractive.
Oh, far be it from me to call you a liar.
All I want is one pupil who's good enough to win the piano competition.
I'm sick of comin' in second to that awful Alexis Radcliffe.
Every year she wins and rubs it in my face.
Oh, Lois, thank God it's you. The last three houses I went to were very rude.
You give me the scroll, and I make you head of sanitation services for the entire city.
Lookin' for that scroll, huh? Wouldn't mind findin' that thing myself.
Why do you care so much about touring a stupid brewery?
Everyone has their sanctuary. The Catholics have churches, fat people have Wisconsin, and I have the Pawtucket Brewery.
Lois, uh, I'm gonna go to the store now, OK?
Stop it! What if the kids were to see you drinkin' like this?
Oh, my God! Please tell me we didn't do it.
Peter, if you keep this up, somethin' terrible's gonna happen.
Oh, no! If there's four tickets and one of 'em's gone, that... that leaves... this many!
Heard you might not enter the competition this year. Smart move.
Yes, well, there are more important things in life than a piano competition.
Oh, yes. Especially for those who have no-oh, that's cold! - Chance.
For your information, I have a student that could whip you.
Well, I guess I'll see you there. Fred, this is not a date!
Don't let her get to you. She asked for Pine Forest. I gave her New Car.
Did you hear? It's over! Somebody found the last scroll!
The recipient declines to be interviewed for safety reasons, but I'm sure you're all with me when I say Congratulations, you son of a bitch.
I guess wantin' it more than anyone just wasn't enough.
Hey, you guys! It's a fake! There's still a scroll out there!
That's right. I made it up. I figured if people thought the last scroll was found, everyone would stop looking, giving me the edge to find it myself.
But what I did was wrong. And as an act of contrition,
I will now insert this carnivorous earwig into my brain.
Oh God! It's eating out the back of my eyes! Aah!
In other news, chocolate may be better for you than once thought. In a recent 12-day study...
Oh, man, this is the happiest day of my life.
Now I know how Barbra Streisand felt the day she married James Brolin.
Oh! I'm so glad I married a regular person and not a celebrity.
Professional ninja Jerry Nelson, how did you find your silver scroll?
I was at home nursing this throwing-star wound, my wife Janey gives me a beer, and bam, there it was.
Honey, I'm sorry. You know you can't sneak up on me.
That's for my brother Luis! He drank himself to death on your crappy beer!
Oh, we don't have one. I guess this is where you get off.
What do you do when you're stuck in a chair
What do you think of the one you call God
I'm glad I'm not takin' your stupid tour! I'm a Coors man anyway! Silver Bullet!
But then they realised it wasn't my time, and so they sent me back to a brewery.
We're still working some of the bugs out of our latest invention, Permasuds.
Beer that never goes flat. No matter how old it gets, it stays carbonated.
Beer that never goes flat! Do you know what that means, Brian?
This beer will still be carbonated long after you die of old age and we buy another dog to help the kids, you know, forget about you.
Ah, what the hell. Cheers! I don't know why he said it wasn't ready.
Me too, buddy. That's why I was holdin' this in, but, if we're gonna die anyway...
Hey, Peter, this next one you can blame on the dog.
What the hell is this? Didn't you see that sign?
Come on, Meg. The competition is this Sunday, and you're not even close to ready.
Lois, take a letter. Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you! You are a bad man! And you made me cry. Furthermore...
Not now, Peter. Meg and I are havin' a little girl time,
Jeez, Lois. Still with the piano? What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here?
No, no, no. Play it like you did last night.
Well, sometimes it does. I mean, you were pretty bad in bed Saturday night.
Come on, Lois, move or somethin'! Jeez, it's like doin' it with a pillow.
Oh, jeez, this hangover's killin' me. I haven't felt this crappy since I went to that museum.
Oh, my God. You can only play the piano when you're drunk!
That's not true. I can also vomit, fall down and make dirty calls to your sister when I'm drunk.
Get a case of beer. We've got a lot of practising to do.
Hey! Everyone! Look at me! Look, look! Look at me.
Oh, well, I guess I don't have to be prepared for the competition...
Too bad Loretta doesn't allow white literature in our household.
This may not be my proudest moment, but damn it, I wanna win.
You're not the first person to do whatever it takes to win.
You come to me and ask me to kill a man I do not know.
Now I ask you, why should I kill this... Count Chocula?
My cereal does not cut the roof of your mouth!
Stay out of it, Herb. You're not even his real father.
Yes, we're checking in. The student's name is Peter Griffin.
They're all closed on Sundays. This is a dry county.
Maybe this is a sign that we need to stop this.
I've been keeping you ripped out of your head for my own selfish needs.
No, no, Lois, we can't stop now after all we've put into this.
Well, you know, when I was your age, we had way better drinkin' games.
Hold it, you two. Aren't you a little old to be drinking illegally?
Make your trills clean and watch the legato in the fourth measure. Go!
Winnin' a trophy at the expense of my husband's health?
Oh, God knows how many of his brain cells I killed, pourin' all that alcohol down his throat.
Lois, you don't get it. The lesson here is that abusing alcohol has absolutely no negative consequences.
You have the trophy and my brain cells are just fine.
Why don't you go up to bed and get some sleep, honey?
Oh, Mary, Mary. You're in the kitchen. You're all disoriented. Let me help you.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
If we all pitch in, we'll be done in no time.
You know I swore I'd never clean again. Not after Bounty dropped me as their spokesman.
Wait a second. Rosie, I've just poured this glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter, and you say that Bounty can pick it up in five seconds?
Sweetheart, we all know you don't have any stuff to do.
OK. Lois's list says clean the windows, clear the gutters and wash the siding.
Peter, there's water and glass and... It's a disaster in here!
Well, Lois, why don't you put down your ginger ale and Redbook and get to work?
You're not helping. Look, don't come near the house. Go do somethin' else.
I'm goin' campin' for the weekend with Johnny Cut-Corners. Want to come along?
Hm. It would be nice to get out of the house.
This is the time of the month when Loretta's visited by her Aunt Flo.
Sorry, bud. The only tent I'm pitchin' this weekend is...
I wanna go. It'll get me away from the evil monkey that lives in my closet.
My last male bonding was when me and Cleveland went to Chinatown.
Look, forget how it happened. Can you just get us outta this?
Are those my books? What the hell are you doing?
Papier-mch. I used them to make the houseboat from Surfside Six.  You remember.
Brian, have you lost your mind? He's just a baby. He doesn't know what he's doing.
I used it to make the fort from F Troop.
Look what I found, Stewie. An appointment card. You've got a checkup.
Marvellous. A quick weigh-in, stick out your tongue, and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.
Remind me to ask the doctor when my other testicle will descend.
Bang! I'm Daniel Boone. I'm a man. I'm a big man.
Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have a Christmas special with Andy Williams.
It's almost as if this world was created especially for me.
Great. You want a cookie whenever you do somethin' right? Get some firewood.
Good for you, son. Hey, where's Chris? I asked him to fill the canteens an hour ago.
I covered my back with honey, and now the ants are takin' me home.
If you turn the light on, they slam him into the fridge.
What's your story? Get lost on the way to the morgue?
They should have put that on before CHiPs. The marketing practically writes itself.
I don't wanna go. I had a bad experience with a fish once.
This is none of my business, but you're turning your boy into a slacker.
Chris, you are responsible for guarding the camp while we fish.
You got it, Dad. You can count on me to...
Tell me, Dr Hartman, do all the children fall in love with you?
Forgive me for not being one of those anorexic babies from the diaper commercials.
Back off! Don't come any closer or I'll cut her.
I'll give her a series of splinters that could, um... you know, become infected.
Oh, no! I'll not be taken in by one of your...
They call this the magic hour: the day's not quite gone, but the night's not quite here, and somewhere, Scott Baio is ploughin' a woman he doesn't love.
The hell it is! You get in there and you kick that fish's ass!
Yeah. All we caught was a tyre, a boot, a tin can and this book of clichs.
Well, thank God we came prepared. We brought enough food to last us...
Holy crap, Chris. What the hell? I put you in charge of the food.
The raccoons were here. See? We're a bunch of sneaky animals. We're gonna wreck this food and eat it, cos we're naughty! And then there's a guy. Let's get him in trouble with his dad! Ha ha ha!
It's not your fault, Chris. I failed you as a father.
I'll teach the boy. Come, my son. I'll show you the ways of the herd...
Why are you sittin' with the sheets over your head?
Well, you always do the skull gag when you're depressed. Talk to me.
Well, it's just... I've been tryin' to teach Chris how to be a man, you know?
First I tried teachin' him how to eat an Oreo.
Chris, the way to eat an Oreo is to twist it, pull it apart and lick it.
Then I tried teachin' him how to get out of payin' a check.
Peter, you can't force-feed maturity. He needs to learn it on his own.
That's it! I can teach Chris responsibility by gettin' him a job.
Isn't she great? Now you see why I married her.
I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books. Here, I brought you some of Peter's.
For the Last Time, I'm not Mr T by Ving Rhames.
Oh, you're burnin' up. Must be a reaction to the shots. I'll go get you some baby aspirin.
What are you talking about? You said the shots were supposed to make me healthy.
You actually believe Lois had them inject you to make you healthy?
Pink as a pistol?! Good Lord! I can't even form a cogent simile any more.
I should have known. Her treachery knows no limits. I...
Oh, fight it, Stewie! Do not go gentle into that good night.
Boys, I'm a miracle worker. I have used all my parenting skills to change my son from a lazy slacker into a workin' man.
Hey, you that Griffin boy's father? Paddy Tanninger, the caddy manager.
Listen, your son is the best ball-shagger we ever had.
I sold twice as many buckets today cos everybody wants to hit the fat kid.
Lynne, cancel my meetings. I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.
Hey, this kid here just knocked the ball 300 yards.
Cleveland, your kid's a natural. With help, he could be a pro.
Oh, Peter, I can't make Cleveland Junior sit still for anything.
But then I just go see what's on the TV.
Well, maybe you're not as good a father as me, huh?
Look what I did with Chris. I'm better than that dad on Lost in Space.
Don, you take my 16- year-old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the day.
You and the robot go out into the wilderness and take this mincing paedophile with you.
Cleveland Junior's beyond your skills. He won't respond to you.
Oh, yeah? Hey. Hey, come here, Cleveland Junior. Come to Peter.
Huh? You'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid into the greatest golfer ever.
Drink this, honey. It'll bring your fever down. I'm gonna go run you a cool bath.
She's one of them. I'm sure of it. Tell me what they injected me with!
Huh! You know Mr T always wanted to be a Broadway dancer?
It could be any number of things. Gene manipulation, sterilisation...
You look spot-on to me. Thank you. I try to work out.
Didn't wanna be a mean guy. Wanna be a dancer.
Like when you were three, and you ate those adult brownies
Pay attention, Junior. You wanna keep your shoulders straight and your knees bent.
And, uh... just once, for me, would you call me Mr Drummond?
Yeah, a secret tunnel, like Hogan's Heroes. Big whoop. Wanna fight about it?
But I'm tryin' to be a good father here. I'm real proud of you, champ.
Oh. Well, at least you have a dad. When I was growin' up, it was just me and my mom.
I just wanted him to be proud of me. I even got a job.
You need to learn how to have a good time. Come on.
I don't think I like feet as much as you do.
I'm gonna grab my girl and head to the beach
Cos I'm a hic-a-doo-La boy And I'm a hic-a-doo-La girl
Hic-a-doo-La's that feeling when you hold hands with your best gal.
Hey, are we in Tiananmen? Because I see a square.
Listen, for today, can you switch and call me Mr Papadapolis?
Hi. Tom Tucker, local news anchor. And on my days off, a golf enthusiast.
That gives me an idea. Come on. I'll explain in the car.
This is the perfect way to show what a great father figure I've been to Cleveland Junior.
Come on, talk to me, sweetie. You look a little down.
I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar with my dad. He doesn't have time for me.
Well, sweetie, part of growing up is learning that adults aren't perfect.
Oh, no. No, it's not all right. I'm outta cash. You take bank cards?
We are at the 17th hole, where Peter Griffin and Cleveland Junior are five strokes ahead, making victory all but a certainty.
I said I could mould your son into a champion.
This is gonna be my greatest victory ever. Except for the time I defeated my evil twin.
One more hole, and that man-boy trophy is ours. Here you go, little buddy.
He's gone. Maybe you better stick to lookin' after your own son.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I can't even think of a reason to get off the bed in the morning.
I've seen that Behind the Music with Leif Garrett 18 times.
I was on a road to destruction, man. The accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive.
It's... it's like I'm, I don't know, trapped in my own life.
Try thinking about others. Why don't you do some volunteer work?
I, uh, I notice you got a new receptionist. Nice little body on her, huh?
Due to several complaints and two deaths related to worker fatigue,
I have decided to throw a company picnic this Saturday.
Hey, John, you got a two-seater. Hey, Derek, maybe you go with John, huh? Huh?
Uh, I think they're lookin' for some witch or something. I don't know. I wasn't listening.
It's over. A lot of people in the audience look pissed.
Now, remember, Chris, we have to work together so that our steps...
This is my favourite event: Catch the greased-up deaf guy.
You are twisted, lady. You hear me? You are screwed up in the head.
The winner of our final contest will receive a very special prize.
Did you hear that? Oh, God, please let it be a fart contest.
I have enough here to take down Robert Downey Jr.
The last one left standing wins. Let the game begin.
No. She made that three nights ago. Wow! That's some nose you've got!
Yeah. One time it almost got me a spokesman deal. Follow your nose.  Follow your nose.  Follow your nose.
I-I just didn't think you were gonna go so cartoony with it.
I was thinkin' of doin' it, you know, good. Like an actor. But your way's good too.
We could use a nose like that at the precinct.
I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter. One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.
I don't wanna feed Grandma bacon while she's in the bathtub.
You're back from Manila. You ate lumpia, then you made love to two Filipino women.
This could be the real deal, boys. Let's do it!
It's coke! Yes! All right! We got 'em! This is great. This is the rush I've been lookin' for.
Good work, Brian. Uh, you still got a little, uh...
We could all go to Purgatory like we did last year.
This isn't bad. It's not that good, but it's not that bad.
Hey, Brian. If cops are pigs, does that make you a schnozage?
Let's see. Four and a half kilos uncut Nicaraguan. 1.7 mil, that area?
Oh, come on, stop it, you guys. It's nothing. Oh, Lois, your toast is ready.
The hell it is. Pure Bogot bullion. This is a drug ring.
Thanks. But the real hero here is God for blessing me with this nose.
So it's settled. We're takin' a cruise to the Bahamas.
And look. It says we have our choice of cabins - port or starboard.
Ha! Listen to me! I sound like an old salt!
I must say, I've always dreamed of a life at sea. I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy And your record will stand as proof Be it galley or freighter, I'm an expert navigator And you're also a world-class poof My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue Well, despite your point of view I can thrill a girl or two But I'd rather get it on with you
Wow, Brian! Have you lost weight? You gotta tell me your secret.
Un-freakin'-believable. First we nailed a bastard who had the gall to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll. Her doll!
Where's the line any more? I got news for ya. It-it's not even on the radar screen.
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see your reflection in it, and the next day it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway staring back at you, mocking you. Blah! Blah! Blah!
Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.
You know what I haven't had in a while? Big League Chew.
So take it from me - McGriffin, the drug dog.
If you really wanna get high, it's as easy as being yourself.
Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to... Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.
Before you go on a cruise, you gotta build up a base tan.
But I heard that if you use tanning beds, you could get something called melanoma.
Oh, that's just fancy talk for sexified. Now, climb in.
Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.
There's worse things than nicotine. And I'm gonna find 'em.
Patience. It took St Patrick more than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.
There's no easy way to say this. You have a drug problem.
A drug problem? What's this really about? Jealousy? Am I stealin' your thunder?
By the way, Horowicz, you should show Joe your impression of him.
Oh, well... It's not as good as my Irish cop. It's just a little thing I... I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up for it by having a very strong upper body.
The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're gettin' in the mood for our cruise.
Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sittin' out there on a boat yammerin' to himself.
Just because you can't feel your teeth doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.
Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to wipe the dried blood from under your nose?
Wait. That man seems to have suffered a serious snakebite.
Brian, would you please ask your new friend to leave now?
Oh, sorry. Things gettin' too real for the Stepford wife?
I leave more personality in tightly-coiled piles on the lawn.
Brian, I know I don't speak up much, and it's really hard for me to talk about my feelings, but...
I miss the old days when you were my sidekick.
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.
Brian, how about a little tie music? Peter's tie, Peter's tie That's because Peter's the guy!
Look, you-you guys got it all wrong. I-I-I... I wa...
I guess now we know what kind of dog he is.
Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait. I should have said Chi-wah-wah.
But why do we have to cancel our cruise just cos the dog's a cokehead?
We're not going on vacation while Brian's in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.
I'll make it up to you. My cousin works at Club Med.
This is where God would come if he had to stop doin' blow.
Good luck, Brian. I just know you're gonna get clean.
Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with all these mineral baths and jacuzzis.
Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun and everyone wets themselves.
I give you gold and I get squat. I'll be in the car.
Our goal here is to find your X factor - the element in your life that made you turn to drugs.
Just having some time away to sort things out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.
I'm on vacation. Oh, and if anyone asks, I'm also on smack.
Peter, this is a detox clinic. You can't vacation here.
Why not? This place is way better than a cruise.
This isn't a vacation for me. I'm tryin' to get healthy.
Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant teenagers from across the lake.
OK, come on, everyone. Exercise is an important part of recovery.
Just work with the resistance of the water. Ten more reps. And one. And two.
What? It was just Carpet Fresh. I'm on your side.
I've been observing your behaviour. I don't think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.
Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips. In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.
I'll be keeping my eye on you. What's your name?
I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess with the pregnant teens across the lake?
I saw one of those - more borin' than when I was a security guard for George Harrison.
I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing one session wouldn't be the end of the world.
What do you think they put in the bug juice?
Sorry. I don't usually let Peter talk me into this kinda stuff.
His behaviour is a negative influence on you. With your intelligence and sensitivity...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. I made my own mistakes. All right?
This man took me into his home and treated me like family.
I came here to get clean and I did. So goodbye.
Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do. He was all coked up and we were choked up But now we're happy Brian's home, cha-cha-cha!
I am serious, Lois. You could be in show business.
Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me, you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.
Joe, if I've learned anything from my experience, it's that we're all responsible for our own destiny.
I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.
Oh, my God. Tell your father not to start the car.
You want my badge number? Here's my freakin' badge number!
In all my research, I've never seen a virus reproduce so fast.
What do you mean, Cut the blue wire? They're all blue.
Brian's gone to Los Angeles to find himself. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
He won't be in LA for ever. He just needs to find himself.
He's not coming back, Lois. He just walked out on us.
If he does come back, I want everything to be how he left it.
You're washing a baby's hair, not scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress.
You are some piece of work, lady. If you... Actually, yes, it is. Greetings from California. I've been very busy. Having a great time trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot of Hollywood parties.  Oh!
I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself.
You know he actually called the main character John Everyman? Come on.
I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.
When I was writing Coastguard, I couldn't think of anyone other than...
He... said he would kill me if I ever said anything.
Yeah. He had a scar on his arm and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.
If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
Yeah! We can get a free trip to LA and see Brian.
Jeez, I haven't been to California since I lived with my other family.
Guys, I just got invited to a party at Sharon Tate's house!
You guys can come, but you gotta promise not to embarrass me.
Talk! I know you've been plotting to foil my plans of world domination.
Very well. If torture won't work, perhaps a little tenderness will.
Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I are going to have a good time together.
Oh, God. Look at me having sex with a pig. I've become my father.
That could be the ideal place to unleash my hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.
I always loved this little sailor suit. Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
Or you could make yourself useful and wipe my button - circular motion.
Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner. I'll take it from here, Julio.
Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener, and a copy of my coming-of-age teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news. And that must be his son.
How can I follow that act? Bite the head off a chicken?
You know what we'll do? We'll get the video camera and make our own show.
Interesting question. More to the point, how does one define job without branding oneself with useless labels?
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered your question with another question.
That's it. That's what you want to hear. Yes, jump through the hoop.
Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood, where people are sexy and clever and always say somethin' funny before the commercial break.
Great. I always end up sitting next to a damn baby.
Turn around. If you've got something to say, say it to my face.
I was going to watch the movie, but forget it. You're now my bitch.
My ears are popping and there's no way to console me.
I'm hungry and possibly teething. Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby.
This is a message for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson.
Listen, I read your script and it just jumped right off the page.
I think it's something I'd be excited to be a part of, so call my...
Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy Phil just found your script at Starbucks.
Give it up, loser, and don't put your number on the cover, you stupid...
I'm using his place. He's working at Club Med. Are you on a cell?
Well, I was invited to the premiere of the new, uh... the new Val Kilmer picture, but I'd rather take you out to dinner.
Crap. I didn't push End. This is gonna cost me a fortune.
Brian! I'm back. Tell me everything. I'm sitting, I'm hearing.
That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian. He doesn't speak English. Can I? Mm-mm.
Catching up. OK, me first. I'm in love. Ooh, too much dressing.
He's from the Philippines. I know - I'm a rice queen.
I have somebody you have to meet. He's a producer. He's great.
It says here this is the gutter where the policeman fell over laughing after Eddie Murphy said he was just giving the transvestite a ride home.
I know, but your boyfriend looks like one of your typical angry black guys.
Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp counsellor all the kids wanna get with.
My director quit and I need somebody who's smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.
Musso & Frank's is famous. See the bar over there?
Oh, man, when that fat broad grabbed that kid's crank through the hole.
Where do they get their ideas? You're the writer. You tell me.
Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching, that emptiness I felt back home, gone.
I've always found your writing a little hackneyed and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?
Yes, but I was talking about stopping by the set to see me in action.
I'm in the business too, you know. I'm going to be on television.
Yes, and I'm tired of you people always calling during dinner.
Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one?
Can someone fluff Paul? He's got a windsock thing goin' on.
Zack, I'm sorry. There's just no way I can do this.
I've been around. I've licked my share of peanut butter.
But I think you need to find yourself a new director.
Is this any more degrading than washing cars? Here you can be creative.
I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is absolutely no way I would consider doing it.
It's like Bang the Drum Slowly, except the drum's a chick.
Peter, slow down. Brian said he was gonna be on the set all day. On the set! Listen to me. Two days in Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.
Come on, Peter. I wanna save some tape for the Hollywood sign.
Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try giving the lines a little subtext this time.
Your husband's always away on business and you feel isolated and unloved, so you begin to think maybe you should go back to graduate school.
That's when you notice the cable man has no pants on.
Wow, a real movie set. Hey, this house looks kinda familiar.
I'll bet Samuel L Jackson is here. He's in everything. There's Brian!
All right, Samuel, when you lay her down, I want you to enter from... Oh, my God!
The Jacuzzi girl didn't show. How long can you hold your breath under water?
Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning.
It jumped right out in front of my car. Oh, I am so sorry.
We just have to face it. Brian's a Hollywood director, and we're small-town people.
It's like stew, only with an ie! at the end.
I had an uncle named Stewie, and he used to sell bicycles.
I love candy. When I was a little boy we would play stickball.
Sorry. I thought the name of the show was Kids Say the Darndest Things, not Old Black Comedians Never Shut the Hell Up.
Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.
Enough of your blether. Good evening, world. From this moment on, I will be your...
What you got there? Oh, you're gonna go skiing now?
That's not funny. That's just saying what happens when you go skiing.
Stop it. Stop applauding him. He's not even using real words any more.
We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta who skips rope with her sister's pigtails.
I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it. And I like pudding.
And Ghost Dad was the best movie I've seen since Leonard Part 6.
You're more than that, Mr Nominated for an Adult Movie Award for Director.
I'd rather they think I'm a jerk than a smut pedlar.
They'll love you even if you made a couple of crappy movies.
Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow. Oops! Score one for me.
Welcome back to E's Adult Video Awards Pre-show. It's a good crowd tonight, Mom.
It sure is, Melissa. All the studs and sluts are arriving.
Add Mama to the Train, The Purple Head of Cairo and, uh...
I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.
The next award is for Best Original Score in an adult film. The nominees are: Ron Jones.
You've come a long way from hiding from the vacuum cleaner.
You like that one, Dick Hertz? Huh? I'm sorry. I'm already drunk.
No! I oughta knock you out for not bringing me here sooner.
If this is what makes you happy, we support you.
My God. I thought I needed to get away from you guys to find what was missing in my life, but the only thing I'm missing is my family.
How could I have become involved in this degrading business?
I wanna thank my incredible team, who've been with me from Shaving Private Ryan to Welcome to my Face.
You got a nice wiggle, baby. You wanna be in a movie? A little girl-girl action maybe?
Wow. That was a wonderful trip, and everyone has something to remember it by.
Oh, my God. Tell your father not to start the car.
You want my badge number? Here's my freakin' badge number!
In all my research, I've never seen a virus reproduce so fast.
What do you mean, Cut the blue wire? They're all blue.
Brian's gone to Los Angeles to find himself. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
He won't be in LA for ever. He just needs to find himself.
He's not coming back, Lois. He just walked out on us.
If he does come back, I want everything to be how he left it.
You're washing a baby's hair, not scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress.
You are some piece of work, lady. If you... Actually, yes, it is. Greetings from California. I've been very busy. Having a great time trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot of Hollywood parties.  Oh!
I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself.
You know he actually called the main character John Everyman? Come on.
I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.
When I was writing Coastguard, I couldn't think of anyone other than...
He... said he would kill me if I ever said anything.
Yeah. He had a scar on his arm and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.
If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
Yeah! We can get a free trip to LA and see Brian.
Jeez, I haven't been to California since I lived with my other family.
Guys, I just got invited to a party at Sharon Tate's house!
You guys can come, but you gotta promise not to embarrass me.
Talk! I know you've been plotting to foil my plans of world domination.
Very well. If torture won't work, perhaps a little tenderness will.
Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I are going to have a good time together.
Oh, God. Look at me having sex with a pig. I've become my father.
That could be the ideal place to unleash my hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.
I always loved this little sailor suit. Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
Or you could make yourself useful and wipe my button - circular motion.
Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner. I'll take it from here, Julio.
Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener, and a copy of my coming-of-age teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news. And that must be his son.
How can I follow that act? Bite the head off a chicken?
You know what we'll do? We'll get the video camera and make our own show.
Interesting question. More to the point, how does one define job without branding oneself with useless labels?
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered your question with another question.
That's it. That's what you want to hear. Yes, jump through the hoop.
Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood, where people are sexy and clever and always say somethin' funny before the commercial break.
Great. I always end up sitting next to a damn baby.
Turn around. If you've got something to say, say it to my face.
I was going to watch the movie, but forget it. You're now my bitch.
My ears are popping and there's no way to console me.

My baby is some kind of diabolical genius bent on world domination!
Bravo, Lois. The last horse finally crosses the finish line.
All these months I should've been paying attention to what you've been saying.
Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you?
Cheer up. Be proud. You've given birth to the future emperor of the world.
Come on, get up. It's opening day for the Sox.
You can't pull the kids out of school for a baseball game.
Nothing they learn in school they can't learn on the street.
Louie left his house at 2.15 and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of five miles per hour. What time will Louie arrive?
It's nothing a little phone call can't take care of.
I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire family was killed and I am a vegetable.
Hold on to this. It'll be a souvenir of your first Major League game with your Dad.
We haven't done anything together like this since we saw Mike Tyson get beat.
I'm so glad you talked us all into playing hooky.
Me, too. Maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off and run onto the field.
That plane crash I told you about, it turned out to be gas.
I'm tired of Mr Weed treating me like a common doormat.
I want him to treat me like a deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw.
If you want Mr Weed to respect you, you're gonna have to earn it.
I heard you ran into my identical twin brother at the ball game yesterday.
If you don't buy that, sorry I was at the ball game.
What do you call it when a guy in middle management moves to upper management?
And so on behalf of the El Dorado Cigarette Company,
I think you'll be very happy with the changes we've made.
This is sweet! Why are you putting a window in the factory?
So Aunt Bee has a place to let her pies cool.
Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry. It'll be ready just in time for lunch.
Wow. These guys sure know how to run a company.
They'll never realise we're using toys to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes.
Can't we eat? I'm so hungry, I could ride a horse.
I don't get it. I could ride it to the store, I guess.
I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.
Perhaps I could help simulate the experience. Yum, yum, yum...
Hey, family, anyone in the mood for lobster? Ow! Oh, God! One of them has my pupil!
Even Kenneth, the badass mail clerk with the heart of gold.
Yeah? That badass just gave half his pay cheque to orphans.
What the hell? El Dorado Cigarettes? That's who bought your company?
Those bastards turned a whole generation of Americans into smokers with subliminal advertising.
If kids see this doll, they're gonna think smoking's OK.
You have to talk to these new bosses in the morning.
Don't worry, Lois. I'll set 'em straight. Just like I did with Chris.
And when I do, you'll understand why I can never go back to SeaWorld.
We need to talk. My wife says you're trying to get kids to smoke.
Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see eight-year-old kids driving. They're fun toys.
Trust me. The last thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.
What about that graph on the wall that says The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.
That's just something my son made me in art class.
Huh. Then what about that poster that says The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking.
I mean, would you really be the president of a company that didn't care about kids?
You shoulda seen the way they treated me. I've never gotten that respect before.
Some company hired me to stand next to you all day, so you'd look better.
But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean.
This is so exciting. Your father's first day as president.
They sent Martha Stewart to help me with the housework.
I take back all the bad things I said about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.
A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.
I think it's a crappy thing! In fact, this is my last cigarette ever.
You make me sick being bought off with a few lousy perks.
Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr Griffin. You have an executive parking space now.
Absolutely. One of the worst days I've seen in years.
The you who said you hated you. You, who love, hate, Yankees, clouds...
Here's your new digs. Now get to work, sport. We're counting on you.
Wow. My own office. I guess I'd better get busy.
There's an anti-smoking bill that could put us out of business.
Excuse me. Do you have a dollar? I'm a little short.
Instead of a smart guy, we should send a moron they can relate to.
Where are we going to find someone who's that stupid?
Wait. Didn't we just make a fat, stupid guy president?
You bet we did. Gentlemen, our new tobacco lobbyist is... that guy!
So what's this big assignment you got for me, chairman of the broad? Chairman of the broad. When did you become such a stitch?
Don't you remember? You gave me writers. I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go 'Whoopee!'
Here's the thing. Some troublemakers in Congress are trying to shut us down.
We need someone important like you to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what fun-loving people the tobacco industry's made of.
But I gotta warn you, I've made some enemies on the Hill.
And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures.
We have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state.
As long as it takes. He's a very important man now.
Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV guide?
I'm sorry. It just feels like for ever since I've had a smoke.
I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
Mr Harrison? I see those government guys you were telling me about.
I'll show 'em a good time and get 'em to come around to our side.
Hey. Hey, Armey. Hey, what's your wife's name? Vagina Coastguard?
I'm kidding. Get in the car. We're going to a skin bar.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.
Oh, it's OK. It's OK, Senator. This girl didn't have a family.
It'll be like she never existed. Grab ahold of yourself.
You may have killed her when you shoved all those dollar bills down her throat.
You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I'm not a doctor.
Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey, and they're both Sssmokin'!
Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day?!
But, hey, I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face!
Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad guys.
If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it!
Yes. I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing initiative.
Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done?
I knew smoking was bad. But I still sold my soul.
Come on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
Ah. They call me Bill Yes, they call me Bill And I'm standing here on Capitol...
Bob Dole's a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes your style.
There you are. I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette company is evil.
Since I became president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano.
I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it. I'm on it.
So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions.
For God's sakes, Lois, he's one. Cut the umbilical cord.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk to you about smoking.
I know a lot of you are already on my side.
And for you naysayers, I have two strong words for you...
Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck ash!
Oh, my God. That's Stewie. Lois was right. Children under four shouldn't smoke.
I don't care about this job any more. Cigarettes are bad!
I propose we send a message to tobacco companies by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars!
That's the spirit, Frank. But I think a real number might be more effective.
All in favour of fining this evil tobacco giant $100 million dollars say Aye.
Thanks for that zinger. Give me a snappy line to go out on.
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. We've had a lot of laughs tonight.
But I'll tell you what's not funny. Killing strippers. Strippers are people, too.
Naked people who may be willing to pleasure you for a price you negotiate.
Besides, there's no need to kill 'em. Most of them are already dead inside.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy

Don't you remember? You gave me writers. I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go 'Whoopee!'
Here's the thing. Some troublemakers in Congress are trying to shut us down.
We need someone important like you to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what fun-loving people the tobacco industry's made of.
But I gotta warn you, I've made some enemies on the Hill.
And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures.
We have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state.
As long as it takes. He's a very important man now.
Thank you, Martha. Brian, could you pass me the TV guide?
I'm sorry. It just feels like for ever since I've had a smoke.
I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
Mr Harrison? I see those government guys you were telling me about.
I'll show 'em a good time and get 'em to come around to our side.
Hey. Hey, Armey. Hey, what's your wife's name? Vagina Coastguard?
I'm kidding. Get in the car. We're going to a skin bar.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.
Oh, it's OK. It's OK, Senator. This girl didn't have a family.
It'll be like she never existed. Grab ahold of yourself.
You may have killed her when you shoved all those dollar bills down her throat.
You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I'm not a doctor.
Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey, and they're both Sssmokin'!
Do I have to listen to this drivel 24 hours a day?!
But, hey, I guess anything's better than looking at your smelly face!
Mom, the school janitor said that Dad's working for the bad guys.
If I had a hole in my throat, I'd put pennies in it!
Yes. I, too, applaud the oaf for finally showing initiative.
Oh, my God! Stewie, no! Oh, God. What have I done?
I knew smoking was bad. But I still sold my soul.
Come on, kids. We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
Ah. They call me Bill Yes, they call me Bill And I'm standing here on Capitol...
Bob Dole's a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes your style.
There you are. I caught Stewie smoking. That cigarette company is evil.
Since I became president, profits have been higher than Alyssa Milano.
I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it. I'm on it.
So Stewie had a puff. He's old enough to make his own decisions.
For God's sakes, Lois, he's one. Cut the umbilical cord.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk to you about smoking.
I know a lot of you are already on my side.
And for you naysayers, I have two strong words for you...
Baby needs to suck ash! Baby needs to suck ash!
Oh, my God. That's Stewie. Lois was right. Children under four shouldn't smoke.
I don't care about this job any more. Cigarettes are bad!
I propose we send a message to tobacco companies by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars!
That's the spirit, Frank. But I think a real number might be more effective.
All in favour of fining this evil tobacco giant $100 million dollars say Aye.
Thanks for that zinger. Give me a snappy line to go out on.
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. We've had a lot of laughs tonight.
But I'll tell you what's not funny. Killing strippers. Strippers are people, too.
Naked people who may be willing to pleasure you for a price you negotiate.
Besides, there's no need to kill 'em. Most of them are already dead inside.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.
So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.
Here's to The Drunken Clam, where they don't ask for proof of age and neither do I.
Are you sure? I-I think I did. All right, well, just to be safe... Oh!
We interrupt this programme for a bulletin on the approach of Hurricane Norman.
And people's parents will throw faecal matter down on them from the rooftops. How awful!
The number one cause of injury during a hurricane is broken glass.
So stay away from the windows. And, Peter, put those away.
Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep the hurricane's gonna sneak up and give me a vasectomy.
Chris, nothing bad ever happens when you're asleep. Sometimes good things can happen.
Oh, Richard Jeni, your HBO comedy specials have brought pleasure to millions.
Hurricane Norman is about to pound Quahog. We go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa to see how locals are dealing with the imminent disaster. Tricia?
Gotcha! See, kids? Disasters have their lighter sides too. You just have to be creative.
Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theatre. I'm so stressed. Life sure is a human race.
Thank God the Open Air Debris Garden is still intact.
Try losin' a testicle in a knife fight with your mother.
I sold the place. Let someone else worry about hurricanes.
The new bowler has a cover point, long-on, square leg, extra cover and two short legs.
You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg.
He scores by dashing between the creases, provided the wicketkeeper hasn't whipped his bails off.
The only British idiom I know is that fag means cigarette.
Lois, The Drunken Clam's been taken over by lousy limey tea-suckin' British bastards!
I was introducing myself to your wife, who I must say is a gorgeous bit of crumpet.
I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard who's purchased your bar.
I'll give you an awkward moment. One time during sex, I called Lois Frank.
Why are you acting like this? Nigel's charming. All British men are.
The British are a lovely people. Not physically, of course, but inside.
Excuse me, what I think you mean to say is, would I like a flower?
You don't so much speak the language as chew it and spit it out.
Everything. Here's a shiny sixpence if you keep your mouth shut and go away.
I know The Drunken Clam was your bar, but you and your friends can find somewhere else to act like idiots.
I guess you're right. You know why I married you, Lois?
It's not just the rack or the caboose. It's that big sexy brain of yours.
Hey, check out those two hotties. They're so lonely, they're practisin' kissin' each other.
Nice choice for a hang-out, Peter. There's not even anywhere to sit down.
Fellas, fellas. What's become of us? We never squabbled before we lost The Clam.
They took our bar, then our friendship. What's next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films?
It vas a glorious summer in Oxford ven I met Freddy Cavendish.
A most remarkable young man whose friendship vould change my life forever.
You are the anchor that gives my spirit licence to soar.
Our forefathers wouldn't take it on the chin like this.
Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em back to whatever country they came from.
Stewie, look. It's an invitation to little Eliza's birthday party.
You mean that horrid girl who talks like a scullery maid?
I didn't realise she'd been born. I assumed she'd congealed in a gutter somewhere.
Splendid. An entire afternoon of her ers and ahs and 'alf a pound of ha'penny rice.
Why can't the English teach their children how to speak?
Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm supposed to say I am so up to it. Ha ha ha.
At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager?
I wasn't betting. Why don't you just shut up for about a week?
Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass in World War II and we can do it again.
Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, we'll have to use our superior linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
I never saw it that way before... Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that?
We're not gonna let this stop us. I've never been defeated. Except once.
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since high school. What are you doin' these days?
Now, don't worry, these guys are trained to stay perfectly still. Check it out.
Hey, Margaret Tha... What the hell...? I thought you English guys never move.
Bloody hell! My lunch was in that hat! Egg and chips with jam butties.
It may taste like a warm cup of tobacco-chewer's spit, but it's still beer.
Our top story: The Clam's Head Pub has burned to the ground.
Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist? Police say no, but our producer says yes.
Here's an artist's depiction of what the arsonist might look like.
Anyone with information regarding this suspect should contact police immediately.
For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the phrase Hey, check out that flaming queen.
In a late development the police have a new suspect.
We now go live to Hispanic reporter Maria J... Ji... Jim...
This is better than COPS. You know there's a fat drunk guy in there.
It appears the real arsonist is in custody, thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.
Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him, you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy...
This Minutemen flag was found in the wreckage of The Clam's Head.
You are clearly guilty of arson, so you are free to go.
Straight to jail. Ha! Now you got burned! No bail.
You can trust me, right? Let's sit down and talk about this.
Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry this terrible tragedy has befallen you.
I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash. I won't take no for an answer.
I mean, they're gonna be disappointed when they find out I'm not gay, but wow.
Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows.
It's in this simulated-leather edition of Time-Life's Killers of Quahog.
They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler...
Well, well. Officer Swanson. You and your friends are dead. You're all dead!
No, no, no! If you're ever going to be a lady, you must speak like one.
Now try it again. The life of the wife is ended by the knife.
We've got five days left, and I'll not lose my wager. Now repeat after me. Hello, Mother, have you hidden my hatchet?
Oh, God, no. It's an H sound, you moron. H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
I'm from Quahog Insurance. I have a cheque for him.
No, not really. In fact, it seems to happen all the time.
Saturday night at midnight. You're dead. All of you are dead.
Midnight on Saturday? Thank God! We can still be in the talent show.
Once again, here is how it should sound. How do you do? Here's how you sound.
What did you say? The life of the wife is ended by the knife.
I think she's got it. I think she's got it! The life of the wife is ended by the knife
By George, she's got it! By George, she's got it!
Now, what ends her wretched life? The knife, the knife
And where's that bloody knife? In the wife, in the wife  The life of the wife is ended by the knife
Bravo, Eliza! The life of the wife is ended by the knife
There he is. We need to search the house for evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel.
What about Loretta? Nigel looks like he's down with the swirl.
There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand tour and show you my... private quarters?
This is my study, where I... study things that arouse my interest.
Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone, I've been searching for someone new.
You know? Someone with a sense of danger and adventure.
One time I went up to this bloke's flat, rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.
I burned down my pub for the insurance money and framed your husband.
I knew it! And what's more, I have witnesses. Bonnie.
Demond Wilson from Sanford and Son? What are you doing here?
And what you've done is a textbook example of insurance... fra-ud?
Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here. Get a front-row seat for this one.
Old sport, why don't you pull your face from your loins and bury it into some humble pie?
Don't give me that smug look. Fine! You have extra-sensitive hearing: Hear this.
Looks like our next stop is a corner booth in a bar in heaven.
My God, is that what I've been doin' to people? I belong here.
Horace, I never thought I'd see you or The Clam again.
Alligator mounted me when I wasn't lookin'. Laid eggs in my lower intestine.
Here's to our wives. They may not be as hot as the women you see on TV.
I don't know where I'm goin' with this. But thanks.
I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson. Whatever he gets is too good for him.
Dear Stewie, I want you to know that I blame my father's death and my incarceration in this hellhole entirely on your awful mother.
If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy

Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired figure skater with the horse teeth, the one who got what she had coming.
Good shot. Made my brown eye blue with that one.
First to where that Pakistani girl fell through the ice after coming to the States for her severely burned face she got when the man she refused to marry dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!
Peter Rabbit would be wise to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.
One more before the missus notices I'm not on the couch.
Hey, careful, Quagmire. Don't get too close to that thing.
It's only a matter of time before he beats you.
What? I'm better than him at everything: Sports, video games, even magic tricks.
Face it, sooner or later you'll have to pass the torch.
I remember the first time Kevin beat me. I was so proud,
I gave him a little congratulatory punch in the arm. Then another.
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went to live with a foster family for a while...
Which is good, cos I finally have someone to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.
No, a malignant tumour, the base of which is lodged deep within your brain.
The end result of a drunken backseat gropefest and a broken prophylactic?
We perform at all the football games. I'm practically a cheerleader!
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.
Now you can be somewhere else when the boys don't call.
Lois, go get the medical dictionary and look up fork and lung.
Say, Meg, looking sharp. You want to go out after the game tonight?
Neil, I'm a flag girl now. I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
Are we all ready to cheer at the game tonight? We? Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
Yeah. This morning my mom was, like, Don't forget your lunch, and I'm all I'm a flag girl now, I won't forget my lunch, and she's all Don't forget your halftime routine.
Moms! Hey, maybe we could all, like, hang out after the game.
You want to go feed the science club after school?
Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer. It constricts the blood vessels...
I demand to know what you plan to do about this. Hey!
Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how these kids celebrate these days!
What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Huh? Come on.
No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call! And I know something about stupid calls.
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at the office and they're making me stay late.
Score's tied, next basket wins. You might finally beat your old man. Old man? I'm the white Larry Bird.
What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Come on!
Son, you played good, but your dad is still number one.
I try to make love to you and you think about Chris.
How did this happen? I'm supposed to be the man of the house.
I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size of my breasts.
They won't. I'm never going back to that school again.
I bet there's a part of you that wants to be friends with them.
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it in the manner to which you're accustomed.
Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart. I know what it takes to be cool.
I just wish I'd known ahead of time. I would've brought potato salad!
Ah, the sun's up. I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.
Wanna go push the janitor, knowing he can't legally push us back?
Peter! Chris, these are plantains. And there's nothing wrong with them.
In fact, a lot of women prefer them to normal-size bananas, because they're exotic and flavourful and very, very special.
Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring for the plantain section. Stop with this!
I mean, mine goes inside me when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!
Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me. Look, I know you're upset, but...
When you pull that thing into your garage, does the garage say Is it in yet?
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids and they didn't spit on me.
Nail them? You told me to win them over with kindness.
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend, it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.
I'm like one of those bald eagles you see on the Discovery Channel:
Beautiful to look at, but mess with one of my chicks and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip your eyes out! Cookies are done.
But keep talking. All this stuff about eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.
Really. I've got about half a pack of Rolaids in my diaper.
I'm glad you want to join the National Gun Association.
Let me show you around. This is our shooting range.
Here we have our locker room with full shower facilities.
You see, Peter, the way we look at it, a man's only as big as the gun he carries.
Sign me up, and get me the biggest freakin' gun you got!
Careful. We don't want it to get too excited and go off in your hand.
This is pathetic. All because you feel inadequate next to Chris.
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete with my son or his freakishly large penis.
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.
Connie Demico's house is two storeys. If we set up booby traps here, here...
Now I've put together a little flash bomb to create a diversion.
That's the music mommies and daddies listen to. Fire in the hole!
The National Gun Association is all about safety, especially when it comes to kids.
Let's face it, your kids will get into your guns. That's a fact.
Gun accidents can be avoided by introducing your children to guns early.
Hi! I'm Petey the pistol. Say, do you ever get lonely?
If you squeeze me, I make bad people go away.
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses used guns to conquer the Romans?
Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris. I can write my name in the snow.
I was starting to think you didn't like me any more.
Shh. Chris, look! Tracks. There must be a deer around here.
Such grace. That's the thing about hunting - you gotta be patient.
Put this in the heating grate and set it off in five minutes.
Did you forget the neighbour kids chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?
OK. Now we're gonna play Seven Minutes in Heaven, and it's my party, so I want Doug to go in the closet with... Meg.
I don't know who should be more humiliated, Meg or the pig.
Mom, you were right! I should have just stuck to the plan!
I figured you might get soft on me, so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.
Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear. Say hello to Satan for me!
Looks like he'll have to repeat the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.
The only way to get rid of them is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
Great. I gotta leave though. I'm going hunting with my son.
Dad, I know what to do! I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!
Go away! Go on, get! Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!
Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing. I mean, I just froze up.
But you handled that bear like a real man. I'm proud of you, son.
You are? Because I heard what you said about my huge... you know.
I was just being stupid. Take it from me, that thing you got there is a blessing.
I mean, every guy you see with a big house or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth is really just saying Don't look at my penis.
You know, Dad, I just realised something. Your name's Peter.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired figure skater with the horse teeth, the one who got what she had coming.
Good shot. Made my brown eye blue with that one.
First to where that Pakistani girl fell through the ice after coming to the States for her severely burned face she got when the man she refused to marry dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!
Peter Rabbit would be wise to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.
One more before the missus notices I'm not on the couch.
Hey, careful, Quagmire. Don't get too close to that thing.
It's only a matter of time before he beats you.
What? I'm better than him at everything: Sports, video games, even magic tricks.
Face it, sooner or later you'll have to pass the torch.
I remember the first time Kevin beat me. I was so proud,
I gave him a little congratulatory punch in the arm. Then another.
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went to live with a foster family for a while...
Which is good, cos I finally have someone to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.
No, a malignant tumour, the base of which is lodged deep within your brain.
The end result of a drunken backseat gropefest and a broken prophylactic?
We perform at all the football games. I'm practically a cheerleader!
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.
Now you can be somewhere else when the boys don't call.
Lois, go get the medical dictionary and look up fork and lung.
Say, Meg, looking sharp. You want to go out after the game tonight?
Neil, I'm a flag girl now. I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
Are we all ready to cheer at the game tonight? We? Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
Yeah. This morning my mom was, like, Don't forget your lunch, and I'm all I'm a flag girl now, I won't forget my lunch, and she's all Don't forget your halftime routine.
Moms! Hey, maybe we could all, like, hang out after the game.
You want to go feed the science club after school?
Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer. It constricts the blood vessels...
I demand to know what you plan to do about this. Hey!
Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how these kids celebrate these days!
What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Huh? Come on.
No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call! And I know something about stupid calls.
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at the office and they're making me stay late.
Score's tied, next basket wins. You might finally beat your old man. Old man? I'm the white Larry Bird.
What do you got? What do you got? Huh? Come on!
Son, you played good, but your dad is still number one.
I try to make love to you and you think about Chris.
How did this happen? I'm supposed to be the man of the house.
I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size of my breasts.
They won't. I'm never going back to that school again.
I bet there's a part of you that wants to be friends with them.
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it in the manner to which you're accustomed.
Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart. I know what it takes to be cool.
I just wish I'd known ahead of time. I would've brought potato salad!
Ah, the sun's up. I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.
Wanna go push the janitor, knowing he can't legally push us back?
Peter! Chris, these are plantains. And there's nothing wrong with them.
In fact, a lot of women prefer them to normal-size bananas, because they're exotic and flavourful and very, very special.
Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring for the plantain section. Stop with this!
I mean, mine goes inside me when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!
Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me. Look, I know you're upset, but...
When you pull that thing into your garage, does the garage say Is it in yet?
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids and they didn't spit on me.
Nail them? You told me to win them over with kindness.
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend, it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.
I'm like one of those bald eagles you see on the Discovery Channel:
Beautiful to look at, but mess with one of my chicks and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip your eyes out! Cookies are done.
But keep talking. All this stuff about eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.
Really. I've got about half a pack of Rolaids in my diaper.
I'm glad you want to join the National Gun Association.
Let me show you around. This is our shooting range.
Here we have our locker room with full shower facilities.
You see, Peter, the way we look at it, a man's only as big as the gun he carries.
Sign me up, and get me the biggest freakin' gun you got!
Careful. We don't want it to get too excited and go off in your hand.
This is pathetic. All because you feel inadequate next to Chris.
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete with my son or his freakishly large penis.
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.
Connie Demico's house is two storeys. If we set up booby traps here, here...
Now I've put together a little flash bomb to create a diversion.
That's the music mommies and daddies listen to. Fire in the hole!
The National Gun Association is all about safety, especially when it comes to kids.
Let's face it, your kids will get into your guns. That's a fact.
Gun accidents can be avoided by introducing your children to guns early.
Hi! I'm Petey the pistol. Say, do you ever get lonely?
If you squeeze me, I make bad people go away.
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses used guns to conquer the Romans?
Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris. I can write my name in the snow.
I was starting to think you didn't like me any more.
Shh. Chris, look! Tracks. There must be a deer around here.
Such grace. That's the thing about hunting - you gotta be patient.
Put this in the heating grate and set it off in five minutes.
Did you forget the neighbour kids chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?
OK. Now we're gonna play Seven Minutes in Heaven, and it's my party, so I want Doug to go in the closet with... Meg.
I don't know who should be more humiliated, Meg or the pig.
Mom, you were right! I should have just stuck to the plan!
I figured you might get soft on me, so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.
Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear. Say hello to Satan for me!
Looks like he'll have to repeat the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.
The only way to get rid of them is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
Great. I gotta leave though. I'm going hunting with my son.
Dad, I know what to do! I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!
Go away! Go on, get! Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!
Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing. I mean, I just froze up.
But you handled that bear like a real man. I'm proud of you, son.
You are? Because I heard what you said about my huge... you know.
I was just being stupid. Take it from me, that thing you got there is a blessing.
I mean, every guy you see with a big house or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth is really just saying Don't look at my penis.
You know, Dad, I just realised something. Your name's Peter.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
A family lost their lives when they swerved off the road and into a ravine, exploding on impact.
I was remembering I accidentally put my shirt on inside out this morning.
It's fine now, though. So what were you saying? A fashion show?
Turn the TV off. We gotta find an anniversary gift for Mom and Dad.
Kids, you don't need to do anything special for our anniversary. Just your father.
I hope he doesn't get you a gift at the last minute again.
My goodness. A human thumb. Where did you ever find this?
I told him it'd be nice if we could spend a romantic day together.
Oh, dear. I think we all know what that means. Boi-oi-oi-oiing. Gross.
Hey, fellas. I got us a tee time tomorrow at Barrington Country Club.
If Lois finds out I'm ditching her, she'll hit me with a frying pan.
Which is why I'm gonna drink this frying pan antidote.
What the hell? Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart. Love, Peter.  Oh, how fun!
Before you tee off, here are your complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this mobile ball cleaner.
Loretta's mother is in town and we have to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.
You could be the first black guy to play this course. People are gonna be impressed.
Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois busy so I could be here. Grip it and rip it.
The fed will be lowering rates, so get your money out of T-bills and put it all into...
What Jughead has done here - and it's quite ingenious actually - is paint pupils on his eyelids so he can sleep through class without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
Peter, why is there a diaper in the lamp socket?
Oh, come on. There's worse things in life than rain. Like... like spiders.
I'll kick his ass. Someone ought to kick his ass.
That was close. That looks dangerous. Somebody's gonna get hurt.
Oh, yeah. Thank God I get to hang out with a fascinating gent like yourself.
What are you talking about? Lois would never leave me.
She's been crazy about me since the night we met.
Oh, my God, that's me! Look how thin I was!
My, this is certainly a beautiful night. I love looking at stars.
Yeah, me too. From now on, this'll be our song.
I've never met a guy like you. You're so full of life.
It's like I can really be myself with you. I'm so happy.
I can't believe I thought that looked good. I must've been high.
Look at that. Huh? Huh? There's no way she's gonna leave me.
I can't until you have a revelation. One of those things that changes your life.
I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.
Oh, crap. I don't have time for this. Listen, I'm late for an appointment.
If you don't want to follow procedure, fine. Stay in limbo.
No, no, wait, wait. I don't want to be in limbo.
OK. It says the next note will be right under my nose.
And quick out in front, Silver Dasher, followed by My Nose!
My Nose out in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some Crazy Lady and Middle-Aged Housewife, followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That and Silver Dasher.
And now it appears there's a woman chasing the dogs.
Too late, Stewie. The fix is in and the noodles are boiling in the pot.
The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston, wealthy young man.
No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!
You're shook up about that appointment. You're Death. What are you afraid of?
Where the hell have you been? When I said lunch, I said noon, not noonish.
Don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't zip up your fly, a seagull will get ya!
God, she's a pain in the ass! I wish Dad was still dead.
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you, Lois's dad was a pain in the ass when I met him.
Take the rap for this. I only get one chance to make a first impression.
And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at her. Huh? Show us front and back there, Lois.
That's world-class juice you got brewing in the old flesh balloon.
Based on what you've seen with your wife, what can we expect in terms of droopage?
Are we talking a slope or full-blown fried eggs hanging on a nail?
Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard. You picked a great day to get rescued.
We were just about to sing a song about mopping. We're mopping the deck Which is Navy for floor And when we're done mopping We'll mop it some more
Could you tell me when you're going back in time?
I was talking to a robe for 20 minutes before I realised you weren't in it.
Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.
Sorry, pal. I've seen the world, and its name is Lois.
You know who he took to the prom? His cousin!
All right. All right, that's it! I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.
Come on, come on. Get back in your big, fat body.
Why should I help you save your marriage when I can't get a girl?
The revelation, jackass! It could have helped you save your marriage.
But too late. Oh, and by the way, when the lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.
Wait, wait. I can't lose Lois! Please, I'll do anything.
What if... what if I helped you get a girl?
All we gotta do is get you fixed up. Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean shave, cologne... Chicks'll be all over you.
You got any SPF-50? I bleach like a gym sock.
Death, will you relax? The beach is a perfect place to pick up chicks.
Now, I want you to go over there and ask those girls if you can play.
How do we get up there? Dad put grease on the pole.
You have to counterbalance the weight at the point where the lever pivots. Like so.
How dare you use me for your own personal selfish... Hmm.
Oh. Pull slower. I must remember to do this game when no one's around.
What was I thinking? You don't know anything about picking up chicks.
Let's ask her then. Lois, should Peter sit around and mope all night?
Or should Peter go out with his buddy and have some fun?
That one's a feminist type, she's into he-men, and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this.
The plight of women is deplorable. I can bench-press 800 pounds.
There you go, Peter. One for you, two for me.
Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy. She works at a pet store.
I met her last summer when her dad hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out.
I guess I don't have a photo. Trust me, she's cute.
Mom, you remember that goldfish we flushed down the toilet?
Hi. I was just, uh... uh... in... in... I was just in the neighbourhood and...
Robert Reed got Florence Henderson and he was a burgermeister.
Thanks, Quagmire. Hope you live next door to me someday.
So, where is it that you need to go, my new honky friend?
Nothing's too far away from Maxine, the cheatin' queen. Women.
I sure did, and I'm a fat idiot. What's your excuse, you big chicken?
You did it! All right! Hey, who knows? You might even, you know...
Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack, so we had to pick her up some Kibbles 'n Bits.
Oh, boy. You just put Peter in the doghouse, which is where your mother...
See, this is why I hate clothes shopping. I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.
You're trying too hard. She won't care what you wear.
She's just gonna be glad to see you. That's how it was with Lois.
It's a long story - with terrific performances and a wonderful scene in a carnival.
I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!
I want you to take this and stay away from my daughter for ever.
No deal. Lois may be worth a million to you, but to me, she's worthless.
Holy crap! Back then I gave up a million bucks just to be with Lois.
Now I won't even miss a golf game to spend our anniversary together.
Wait a minute. That's my revelation. I gotta pay more attention to my wife!
Eureka. Now, come on back to the golf course. I've got a date.
Death, wait, wait, wait. Before we go, I need you to do me one more favour.
Oh, no! God, please no! I'm too young to die!
All right. If you want to live, come with me. And bring your guitar.
And bring that thing you use to make it go wah... wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.
Damn. How could he lie to me on our anniversary?
This is the most romantic gift you've ever given me. How did you put this together?
I had a little help... from a very special friend.
I bought these shoes from a company on the Internet, cos they don't test on animals.
You know, animals never have war. War is an invention of mankind.
What the hell are you talking about? Animals fight all the time!
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
You must have had a great body before it went all fun-house mirror.
The tourists are gone and we have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over.
Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game, and red like the sauce on my mamma mia's gugotz.
Yeah, and brown, like the guys I don't pick up in my cab.
Quahog is infested with loud, hairy creatures, also known as New Yorkers.
I think I speak for all of us when I say
Christ, quit it! Mom, Chris put his foot on my side again.
Stop whining. Stay on your side. Lois, get off your ass and do some parenting.
If you don't stop, we won't go to McDonald's after church.
Brothers and sisters fightin' is as natural as a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.
Some of my novelty items were provided by Jack's Joke Shop.
My cousin, Father Sapienza, is in from New York to see the leaves.
I'd like to invite him to do the opening prayer.
Yo, God is good, huh? And he expects us to be good.
And if you're not, he's gonna come down and bust your freakin' skull. Amen.
Who do you think you're talking to? God ain't tougher than me.
You can't talk to the father like that, you stupid gavone.
Wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.
Fellas, this is God's house. And the Patriots kick off in 45 minutes.
Tae-jitsu is about power - for your body and your mind.
Like Julie Andrews in that movie where she showed her breasts.
Watch where you're going. Horace, put the Pats game on the TV and get me a few beers.
And the kegs. And I'm not sure, but I think I've been shot.
Hey, pal, watch my seat. I gotta bleed the lizard.
Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million Man March when protesters burned our Porta-Pottis.
Then I used my stream of justice to put out the hate.
I don't know, fellas. I think there's potential in this crowd.
Honey, why don't you turn around and show me the Lower East Side?
Transvestite! Back off. This place blows. We gotta send these strap-hangers back.
An idea so smart, my head would explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.
Go back to New York or I will eat you.
Just like I ate insane New York anchorman Dan Rather. Pah!
And look who I had for dessert. Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Pah!
Leave my land or I will smite you with my powerful limb.
Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt cos girls don't have anything down there.
I won't be responsible for bringing fistfighting into our schools.
Gee, can you hear me all the way back there in the '50s?
I emasculated him in front of all those people. I think he's really upset.
Come one, come all. She floats like a butterfly and stings like when I pee.
Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction. At least, not any more.
I want you to get rid of all of this right now, cos I am never fighting again, ever!
Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to plan B.
Help me! Help me! For God's sake, he's gonna kill me!
Don't worry. It's a trained bear. He's in no real danger.
Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio! My wife here needs to talk to you.
Nobody walks all over my wife, cos I won't let 'em.
She learns things eventually. It just takes her longer. Come on.
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
I know you're not puttin' that rock up from here. You ain't got no J.
Now don't make me put my size 13s up your narrow ass!
I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch! Now how you gonna act?
Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here. This is my house.
Either my baby swings from this jungle gym, or you do.
Nobody walks all over me. Those days are over. Lois Griffin demands respect.
I smell a messy diaper. God, why does that turn me on?
That's Randy, and that's Fred. Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat.
When you get 'em together, hold on to your sides!
Stop it, both of you. Starting now, you two are gonna love each other.
Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage those damn leafers dumped on our lawn.
New York Post, New York Magazine, the New York Mets.
Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers. Take some action.
Hello? 911? It's Quagmire. Yeah. It's in a window this time.
The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden?
Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.
About the seat, or about my ploughing your father's wife?
If it is, it probably runs like you - very homosexually.
That's right. Go back where you came from, you bastards!
We'll conclude the graduation ceremony with a demonstration by the black belts.
I could never violate the spiritual bond of the student-master relationship.
Go, Lois! Pummel him with your powerful fists of female fury.
And then when he's weary, emasculate him with your incessant nagging.
This is mine. This is where my babies come from.
If this glacier goes slower than one mile a year, we're all dead!
Tell me something I don't know! Get out of the way!
Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Those are my graham crackers.
I'm going to go find something to strike you with. Excuse me.
I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.
He freed the beast all over the back of Peter's head.
This is my fault! I brought violence into this house!
It takes a very steady hand. Don't touch the sides!
Everybody does it. At least, everybody I know. Shut up!
Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy doll and show me how they act together.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
Give me that. Insecurity. Gender confusion.  I'll give you something to write about.
Look at me. I'm insane! I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender.
Mr and Mrs Griffin, does Stewart have a history of aggression?
No. Hitting Peter is the first violent thing he's ever done.
Technically, the first was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
Now, just a minute! The whole reason I started fighting is because of you.
I felt weak. You never listen to me. You undermine me in front of the kids.
And besides, you're not exactly Father of the Year yourself.
Well, there seems to be a lot of anger in your household.
You owe it to your son to learn how to manage these feelings.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
Tell Chris to quit drawing pictures of me with a pig's body.
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.
I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb. Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales, but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.
It was eight freakin' dollars, and we have a dozen places to put it!
Me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the rug by the door. I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg. For the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.  Dad! Dear Stewie. Get out.  That's nice.
Mine just says Dear Lois.  And after that it looks like someone just spit on the paper.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other.
Nor is bleaching the hair on your upper lip, Martin Mull.
Wanna hear something really funny? Those pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills.
Are you telling me I just sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing?
Did it kill you to be multicultural for a minute?
How's this for a name? Pony Express is in.  What have you got for me, Joe? Let me see. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois.
Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.
I don't believe that. I think it's all the TV we watch.
Why the hell doesn't the government tell us what we can and can't watch?
Shame on the network that puts this junk on the air!
Peter, maybe you shouldn't say anything bad about the network.
What are they gonna do? Cut our budget? I'm gonna go get a beer.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy

Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to plan B.
Help me! Help me! For God's sake, he's gonna kill me!
Don't worry. It's a trained bear. He's in no real danger.
Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio! My wife here needs to talk to you.
Nobody walks all over my wife, cos I won't let 'em.
She learns things eventually. It just takes her longer. Come on.
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
I know you're not puttin' that rock up from here. You ain't got no J.
Now don't make me put my size 13s up your narrow ass!
I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch! Now how you gonna act?
Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here. This is my house.
Either my baby swings from this jungle gym, or you do.
Nobody walks all over me. Those days are over. Lois Griffin demands respect.
I smell a messy diaper. God, why does that turn me on?
That's Randy, and that's Fred. Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat.
When you get 'em together, hold on to your sides!
Stop it, both of you. Starting now, you two are gonna love each other.
Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage those damn leafers dumped on our lawn.
New York Post, New York Magazine, the New York Mets.
Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers. Take some action.
Hello? 911? It's Quagmire. Yeah. It's in a window this time.
The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden?
Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.
About the seat, or about my ploughing your father's wife?
If it is, it probably runs like you - very homosexually.
That's right. Go back where you came from, you bastards!
We'll conclude the graduation ceremony with a demonstration by the black belts.
I could never violate the spiritual bond of the student-master relationship.
Go, Lois! Pummel him with your powerful fists of female fury.
And then when he's weary, emasculate him with your incessant nagging.
This is mine. This is where my babies come from.
If this glacier goes slower than one mile a year, we're all dead!
Tell me something I don't know! Get out of the way!
Whoa! What the hell are you doing? Those are my graham crackers.
I'm going to go find something to strike you with. Excuse me.
I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.
He freed the beast all over the back of Peter's head.
This is my fault! I brought violence into this house!
It takes a very steady hand. Don't touch the sides!
Everybody does it. At least, everybody I know. Shut up!
Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy doll and show me how they act together.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
Give me that. Insecurity. Gender confusion.  I'll give you something to write about.
Look at me. I'm insane! I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender.
Mr and Mrs Griffin, does Stewart have a history of aggression?
No. Hitting Peter is the first violent thing he's ever done.
Technically, the first was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
Now, just a minute! The whole reason I started fighting is because of you.
I felt weak. You never listen to me. You undermine me in front of the kids.
And besides, you're not exactly Father of the Year yourself.
Well, there seems to be a lot of anger in your household.
You owe it to your son to learn how to manage these feelings.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
Tell Chris to quit drawing pictures of me with a pig's body.
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.
I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb. Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales, but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.
It was eight freakin' dollars, and we have a dozen places to put it!
Me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the rug by the door. I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg. For the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.  Dad! Dear Stewie. Get out.  That's nice.
Mine just says Dear Lois.  And after that it looks like someone just spit on the paper.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other.
Nor is bleaching the hair on your upper lip, Martin Mull.
Wanna hear something really funny? Those pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills.
Are you telling me I just sang Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing?
Did it kill you to be multicultural for a minute?
How's this for a name? Pony Express is in.  What have you got for me, Joe? Let me see. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois.
Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems.
I don't believe that. I think it's all the TV we watch.
Why the hell doesn't the government tell us what we can and can't watch?
Shame on the network that puts this junk on the air!
Peter, maybe you shouldn't say anything bad about the network.
What are they gonna do? Cut our budget? I'm gonna go get a beer.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
They got these plastic disc guns. I haven't seen one since Cleveland's wedding.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of these two people in the bonds of holy matrimony, consecrated before God Almighty.
You were just making it look like you were playing. You're a phony!
Let me guess. Another colourful box with a crank that I'm expected to turn until - big shock - a jack pops out.
And you laugh and the kids laugh and the dog laughs and I die a little inside.
When I stick this army guy with the sharp bayonet up my nose, it tickles my brain.
What I'm about to show you is a fight scene from Star Trek, season one, episode 18.
I'm going to identify when it's Shatner and when it's his stunt double, Fred Lubbins.
That's Shatner, but when I freeze-frame, you can clearly see Lubbins' coffee cup.
What in God's name...? Mr Lassenbee, what the hell's going on here?
There's a law against teaching the evolutionary theory that Gil Gerard used a time machine and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.
Tom Tucker, live at James Woods High School with this sensational breaking story.
A teacher caught molesting children... with crackpot theories. Full story at 11.
Hey, kids. Remember, Mr T says I pity the fool who does drugs.
Reports indicate she has consumed a record amount of seamen.
In other news, school board elections took place last evening.
Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are. ...turmoil when President Bush stuck his finger in a socket.
Yikes. Awkward. ...that's where leprechauns hide their gold. More at 11.
Hey, you know who lives in this house? A great big phony! That's right.
I say, look at me. I feel like a regular grease monkey.
Oh, yeah, you took her for a spin that time.
But Huey Lewis needs time to create. We have to be patient.
And in entertainment, Mary Tyler Moore is 64 years old today.
Are you a student interested in the glamorous world of unpaid internships?
If so, you can try out for Channel Five's young anchor programme.
You'll gain valuable experience, work closely with Tom and me, and produce your own on-air report.
Do you think it tickles women when I kiss them?
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you! This is beyond anything I've ever dreamed of!
Well, well. It appears the Fates have conspired in our favour. Eh, Meg?
Stay away from me, Neil. Just because we're working together does not mean I like you. Give it to me!
Great. Cos you two are gonna have so much fun!
I did one with Dustin Hoffman. He's almost impossible to book.
Dustin, it's been a while. I gotta say, you look great.
I am not trying to seduce you, Dustin Hoffman. You really look great.
We appreciate you taking the time to be with us here in the studio.
Can you believe it? Our little Stewie learning to ride his first tricycle.
This'll be more exciting than when Brian taught me about Columbus.
What the...? Hey, hey, let go. Get your filthy paws off.
Let go. Let go, I say. Let go. Don't let go!
I gotta go check on dinner. You keep taping Stewie. Don't miss a moment.
It's this incredibly benevolent force that wants me to know there's no reason to be afraid.
Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, it makes my heart burst.
Do you have any idea how complicated your circulatory system is?
Hi, Mr Tucker. I brought you Rice Crispy Treats. I remember you said you liked them.
Look. This one is in the shape of a heart.
I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man in my spoon. Come back later.
Try to move in on my woman, will you, Tom Tucker?
No one crosses Neil Goldman and gets away with it.
I added something to your coffee I don't think you're gonna like.
Bring it to me with urine in it like I asked.
Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I suppose you do have to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues.
Well, then, I'll just wait right here till you get back.
He wasn't taking it for a test ride, he was just taking it.
Mr Tucker, has anyone ever told you your eyes are...
Hang on, sweetie. I've gotta call Peter Jennings and reschedule our golf game.
Mr Tucker, Miss Simmons, there's a nut on top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle.
The gunman's been identified as the Mass Media Murderer who targets the press.
I think this would be a fine opportunity to give our interns real-world experience.
That means you'll get to ride in the news chopper. I'm so jealous.
I'm gonna splatter his distinguished career all over the pavement.
Dan Rather thinks he can condense a whole day's events into a half-hour.
Ha-ha! See ya later, sucker! And by the way, Rather is an OK guy in small doses.
Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's so much of life I haven't experienced!
I never got the chance to be some drunk college guy's last resort!
My years of expensive orthodontic work will be a total waste!
All in a day's work. If you ever need me, just blow this whistle, or call John Stossel's cellphone.
We now go to junior anchor Neil Goldman with exclusive footage from today's exciting scene.
Thank you, Diane. There may have been some commotion on the rooftop, but the real story was inside the mouths of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman, where a meeting of the tongues, a summit of saliva, established a new world order of love.
This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil and begin life anew as Meil.
I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.
Constable, I'd like to report the theft of my tricycle.
Oh, look at the little baby. Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
I'm here to turn myself in. I have a dismembered hooker bleeding in my trunk.
Oh, look at the little baby. Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
Neil, what are you doing? I'm not your lover. I don't even like you.
Meg, I strongly suggest you hold my hand, lest you look like a slut.
Tell these people that there's nothing going on between us.
Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg. I won't let you burn.
Ziggy says you can't leap until she loves you back.
What do you want to work on? Cardio? Upper body?
Upper body. I need to get buff, so I can get my tricycle back.
Luckily, we're running a special for the next 17 minutes.
The normal plan is 78 months at 40 a month and 200 down. Watch this.
Let's start you off with a body-fat test, maybe a heart rate.
You're not hearing me. I don't think this is for me. Thanks, anyway.
And for the future, you came on a little strong.
Seeing as you two will one day bless our home with the pitter-patter of grandchildren as ugly as sin.
Meg, you never told me your mother was such a stone-cold fox.
I'm supposed to be on my best behaviour tonight and not mention poo.
I think it's very, very nice that our children had this wonderful kiss.
I remember when Muriel and I had our first kiss, and it was just awful.
Oh, just awful. We were both very sick. Weren't we, dear?
We were both 14 and it was winter and we had terrible head colds.
Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible mucus coming out from inside my nose.
And the other children, they were very nasty to me.
They called me Tasty Cakes, and they would beat me and stick pine cones in my ass.
Once for the bulk, and again for the remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.
My hooligan friend, I've been racking my brain in a fruitless attempt to resolve our unpleasantness.
But then it dawned on me. Your cruelty merely stems from a deep-seated inner pain.
The obvious remedy is a healthy dose of outer pain!
Children washing cars to raise money for charity. Is anything more arousing?
We go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel Five junior anchor segment on the moon.
The moon. There's a reason no one goes there. It's cold, and it's ugly.
Oh, wait! That's not the moon. It's Neil Goldman's face.
Recently, many of you saw me kissing this freak of nature.
If I wasn't seconds away from death, I wouldn't have done it.
I mean, who in their right mind would? I went to the streets to find out.
Hear that, Neil? I don't like you. I never will! Back to you, Tom.
Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars can be choosers. And now this.
Ironic that your fate is in the hands of an infant.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. Our top story: The president has been shot.
A breaking story! A geek is on top of Town Hall! He's about to jump!
I was just a piece of eye candy that she turned into an all-day sucker.
Mr Tucker! Thank God you're here! Someone's got to do something! He'll fall!
I'm on it. Have that cartoon sound-effect guy cue up the...
And if there's time, be ready with a... Wah, wah, wah, wah.
All you care about are your stupid ratings! You're a horrible man!
It's hard not to when I'm lying right on top of you.
Just because you're repulsive and the most annoying person on the planet, and I'm not the only one who thinks so, doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.
Thanks, Meg. But I was never really planning to jump.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy

On the whole, I enjoy my job as a pharmacist.
In fact, many of my customers are your mommies and daddies.
Jimmy, your mother had awful postpartum depression after you were born.
And, Danielle, your father had very bad haemorrhoids that stung him unmerciful.
They were awful. They were like stinky little balloons. Ugh!
I gave him some special ointment, and he hurt so bad that he had to apply it in the car with his sock.
Thank you, Mr Goldman. Our final speaker is Mr Griffin.
I work at a toy factory. And you know what I do there?
I bet you're just a low-level assembly-line guy who stands all day screwing heads on dolls. Ooh, is it on straight? I don't know.  Boo!
Finally, we go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, interviewing a guy from the Renaissance Fair.
Thanks, Tom. Sir, for those who aren't familiar with the tradition, tell us about the Renaissance Fair.
Yea. But first, bride of Genghis, thou must explainest to me thy very peculiar electronic wand.
Ahem. Cinderella had three wicked step-watermelons who were very smelly to her. So her fairy god-toilet turned a pumpkin into a fanny and sent her off to the poop.
I was terrible. Everyone else had an important job and was way more successful than me.
Invite Mr Weed to dinner and show him what you have to offer.
I guess I could. I just hope it goes OK.
We loved you in the Superman movies. You were just wonderful.
Mr Weed, I, uh... was wondering if maybe you'd like to come to my house for dinner Friday night.
If I blow this, I'll have to go back to my old job at The Electric Company.
Oh, God. I hope I don't get so nervous I can't control the volume of my voice.
Thank you, Mrs Griffin. I understand you have a beautiful family.
We do. But the children won't be joining us for dinner. It's their bedtime.
The Griffin children would like to say good night to you.
Mmmm. Who would think that a woman with such beauty would have the culinary skills of Emeril Lagasse?
Ahem. Peter, don't you have something to say to Mr Weed?
Mr Weed, I don't care what the guys at work say. I don't think you're an effeminate weirdo.
Peter, being here with your wonderful family, your beautiful home and your funny talking dog... well, I'm impressed.
Starting Monday, I'd like to promote you to head of toy development.
Holy crap! Oh, thanks, Mr Weed! You won't be sorry.
Ha-ha! Gotcha! It's just me - Death. I'm here for the body.
We met at the Sky Lounge last night. Call me.
In other news, toy industrialist Jonathan Weed was found dead in the home of an employee who claims Weed choked on a roll.
No charges will be filed against the employee, but the roll is in custody.
Lose the pigtails and we'll talk. Do her, do her...
And now, the last man to see Jonathan Weed alive has offered to say a few words.
As you know, we of the Christian faith believe that Jesus is not really dead, but that he must let the world think he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.
Anyway, before he died, Mr Weed promoted me to head of toy development.
I brought my attorney who confirms that this constitutes a verbal contract.
I'm Mr Weed's lawyer. We found this tape among Mr Weed's personal effects with instructions that it be screened immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.
Turn that off. I don't have my face on yet.
It's just a couple of eggs with the peppers left over from last night.
Hello, friends. If you are watching this, I am dead, and I bet you're pretty bummed.
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory shall be torn down to make way for the Happy-Go-Lucky Terminal Disease Institute.
OK, we've got your typing test here and all the pertinent data about your, um... um, you know, your background and, um... skills and...
I only have another week and a half here, and I have completely checked out.
Sorry, we're out of towels. Let me get that for you, sir.
I should pay two bucks for stickers cos this guy can't hear? Come on!
He's sampling a few things, searching for something that fits him just right.
OK, but it'll cost ya. You want a Cleveland Steamer?
Yes, you go to Maple Street, and then take a left, and then you go...
He was so forgetful, whenever he tried to remember a name, he drew a... blank.
This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you so hard to invite Mr Weed to dinner, he'd still be alive and you'd have your job.
We'll get through this. We just have to scrimp a little.
When we got married, you always talked about your dream job. Remember?
You put that dream aside in order to provide for this family.
I've saved some money from teaching piano, and this is the perfect time for you to pursue that dream.
Wow. Since money's tight, I was gonna suggest that we eat the kids.
Jokingly at first, but then I was gonna gauge your reaction.
If you were cool with it, we could go from there. But this is a much better idea!
Yes. I'm trying to overcome my fear of swords because a man in a pirate suit stabbed me in the ear when I was five, and then again when I was 30. And you? The same?
Nah, not really. It kinda all goes back to when I was 18.
I was going through that rebellious phase, and I was hanging out with a bad crowd.
But at that time, I was ready to believe anything.
I wandered around and ended up at the Renaissance Fair.
I was saved by the one and only Black Knight of the Quahog Renaissance Fair.
A word of advice. The path to knighthood is paved with strength and nobility, not LSD and sideburns.
And from that moment on, I knew someday I wanted to be a knight like him.
I took so many, I thought I was Mr Peanut.
So, you think you got what it takes to be jousters!
If you're gonna joust, you gotta want it! Let me hear your war cry!
Is that the best you got, you pile of crap?
Yes. From an early age, my parents discouraged loud noises.
The concept of a geocentric universe gets you sexually excited, doesn't it?
You want to make 16th-century mathematician Johannes Kepler your bitch?
Look alive. Allow me to introduce the best of the best, the Black Knight himself!
I just wanted to thank you. I don't know if you remember, but when I was a kid, you helped me get my life back on track.
Are all the other men out of the shower yet?
Hey, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker, and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm protected by my impenetrable cereal-box fort. Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, I'm calling you drunkie, and there's nothing you can do about it...
If I'm gonna impress the Black Knight, my lance must be with me at all times.
You guys will be so proud when you see me on that field.
Oh, thou wishest to feast on the appendage of a humble ovine.
Listen, freak. We don't all watch Frasier. Now give me two mutton joints.
She walks over here and asks me to put a bird in her panties! I'm going What the hell?
Oh, God! Peter, play dead! Curl up in an ass ball or something!
Oh. OK, but we can see each other outside the fair, right?
What are you doing? I spent hours soldering that costume for you.
I don't need it any more. I quit the team.
You can't quit jousting. The big meet is today. I thought...
But I'm being serious here. We were all set to come see you joust today.
You were so excited to be on the field with the Black Knight.
I'll be watching him from the stands, because the Black Knight is a big jerk, just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.
It's an exciting day here at the Renaissance Fair, wouldn't you say, Tom?
It would be if you didn't remind us all of our grandmother's cleavage.
Let's go to the field, where the Black Knight prepares to challenge his opponent. Ohh... Hey Ohh... Hey
That's it. The Black Knight is out of challengers and is once again undefeated.
And what are you doing here, Griffin? I told you never to come here again!
You see that, kids? Your father's nothing but a fizzle!
Nobody calls me a fizzle and gets away with it!
Except that guy who called me a fizzle and then ran off. He got away with it.
But most people who call me that don't get away with it.
Actually, that guy was the only one who ever called me a fizzle.
After today, only half the people who called me a fizzle will have gotten away with it.
To the owner of a yellow Hyundai, your car is being towed.
Take that, you bastard! Nobody makes a fool out of Mort Goldman!
Spectacular, maggot! How'd you like to travel with us as our lead jouster?
Lt'll be OK, Chris. Remember that episode of The Honeymooners when Ralph lost his job but didn't get it back?
Yeah, why was that? That bugged the crap out of me.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Peter, this is ridiculous. I know you're upset about losing your job, but you've sat there for two weeks.
All right, all right. Brian, let's go for a walk.
My life. That's what's wrong. I was totally humiliated at school today.
Would those who are going away for spring break please move to the left of the room?
Oigan, quienes van a spring break, pasen a la izquierda, por favor.
So do we. I'll tell you what. How about you and I have our own little spring break?
We'll go to that fancy new spa that just opened up.
Massages and facials. It'll be great. What do you say?
I guess it couldn't be worse than last year when we all went to Sea World.
Lois is right. I've been out of work too long.
Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job. Fresh sea air, working outside.
That's how a real New England man makes a living.
What it's doing by the wharf, we should ask a scientist...
I'm afraid I'm won't be able to do this in the time I quoted.
Chris, shut the hose off for a second. I have an announcement.
I am gonna drop this weight and rejoin the workforce.
It makes sense. You know how much time I've spent on the ocean.
Tell Walter I won't be able to make it to the construction site.
So... I don't know. Have him send Frank or Glen or Harelip Steve.
We open today's bidding with this pair of panties confiscated from a prostitute.
Please direct your attention to this photo of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.
And now the actual boat itself. Do I have an opening bid for the boat?
You want to buy that boat? Go ahead, take it.
Don't expect me to fish your dead body from an angry sea that gave you fair warning.
Are you up for bids, too? You are just precious.
I left you the number for the spa. See you in a few days.
Not if I strangle myself with a seaweed wrap and die.
You haven't told me how you expect to pay for that boat.
There's got to be a hundred banks that'll give me a loan.
What sets us apart from other banks is that other banks are banks.
I'll take 'em. Just kidding. Or maybe I'm not. Sign this.
OK. I can draw Kermit the Frog. How about a nice Kermit the Frog?
I promise after a few days you won't remember the words spring break.
Hey, this is VH1 and we're rocking at spring break. ...leaving thousands injured. For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw, keeping it real and kicking ass at spring break! Whoo!
Here she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.
She's a fine vessel. Welcome to the wharf. Name's Hennessey.
I'll let you in on a secret, neighbour. The best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71.
I'll see you, fellas. I got some fish to catch.
Let's see, latitude 42, longitude 71. This is it. What the hell...?
Stop crying. You just became a man. Act like one.
What's the big idea sending me to that bar mitzvah?
Cos I don't like you! We don't need any more fishermen crowding up this wharf!
Nice fish you got there, Griffin. What are you selling? Your bait?
First, I hang the old worm out there. They usually go for it.
I jerk 'em around. They fight for a while. Then they lay back and accept it.
Did you read the fine print on this loan contract?
If by read, you mean imagined a naked lady, then yes.
And if you don't pay them within 48 hours, they get the house, too.
Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!
Did I ever tell you if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic, it makes it not work?
Because no one told me. I thought you should know.
Fine. I just don't understand why we had to leave the spa so early.
I wanna go home and spend the next three days in solitary confinement where I belong!
Did you hear what happened to that dude from UMass?
He got so drunk he fell off his hotel balcony! He's in a coma!
Like the kids say, up your nose with a rubber hose!
This is Carson Daly. We're live here at spring break. Who wants to party?!
Now let's go to Tom Green, who's gonna do something really outrageous!
Does anyone out there like me yet? Can I stop this?
Your house? This is my house. My wife and I bought it from the bank.
I still got another day to pay back the loan.
While I may not agree with what you say, I'll defend to the death your right to say it.
There we are. It's a Van Gogh print. Isn't it beautiful?
I've fantasised about what this house would be like with culture.
You were gonna pop inside real quick and find someone who looked like me so I could use their ID, then you were supposed to come out and give me the ID so I can get inside!
You need to learn how to loosen up a little, toots.
Chris, we've been over this a thousand times. It's pronounced Griffin.
All right. All right. I've got one. I've got one. OK.
Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates. Oh, God, wait. How did that one go?
It turns out they're Siegfried and Roy. I'm no good at telling jokes.
Lois will be home in a coupla days and we're getting kicked out tomorrow.
A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks like a jackal! Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?
Why the hell would it be right the next ten times?! God!
I am screwed. I'm gonna lose my house and my boat and everything.
You could whore yourself out to a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks apiece.
What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks need love, too. But they got to pay.
You need 50 grand, Griffin? I got a suggestion for you.
You'd be buying yourself a one-way ticket to a watery grave.
Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless creature that's ever inhabited the sea.
Legend has it he dwells out by Fish Stench Cove.
He'll kill any man that comes near there. I saw him once.
Sure, I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye was infected that day from picking at it, and I was tired, and I'd been swimming in a pool with too much chlorine, and my glasses were at LensCrafters, but I seen that fish!
If there's 50 grand in it, I don't think I got a choice.
You can whore yourself out to a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks.
Daggermouth killed my friend Salty, and he was twice the fisherman you are.
Lt'd be suicide to go after that fish. There's got to be another way.
No! I am not gonna let my family live on the street.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny.
I gotta be crazy to think I can kill that man-eating fish. What the hell am I doing?
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, Peter. What kind of talk is that?
Yeah, you can do it. Who's my big brave boy, huh?
These are the best years of your life. Let's get up there and live a little.
Why do you cops always have to kill our buzz?
Too bad I didn't get there till after the sodomy. Let's go kick some fish ass!
I can't believe I just showed everyone my tater tots.
Worst of all, now I'm gonna have a police record.
If you're gonna grab ahold of life, you've gotta expect to get your hands dirty once in a while.
The four of us out at sea, miles away from civilisation, tossing back brews.
Amen to that. You guys, here's one for you. Let's say none of us were married.
If you could have any woman, who would it be?
I think she's very attractive in a classical kind of way.
Can I change my answer...? Of course I know it's paper! I don't care!
You guys are yanking me. Let's put one over on old Quagmire.
Oh, my God, I can't... Oh, God! I got all these magazines!
I heard that when Daggermouth eats you, he devours your guts first.
I heard he doesn't just eat you, he eats your soul.
I heard that one of Shannon Doherty's eyes is off-centre cos it's trying to escape.
Not so fast! Perhaps I could offer you a glass of port.
And you, a glass of starboard. That's a nautical joke.
My God. Isn't it amazing that that's what we all look like on the inside?
That's what I wanted. I disappeared and spread the Daggermouth rumour myself.
And now I'm gonna give you $50,000 to be on your way.
The longer we stay here, the more people will question how a fisherman with no engineering background built a sophisticated talking fish robot.
You know, honey, I'm really sorry for how I acted.
Getting drunk and ditching you at the bar, and letting those boys take pictures of you sleeping.
I was so busy having fun, I guess I kind of ruined it for you.
And now, back to Daggermouth and Boom Boom on Nickelodeon.
Yes. I did 20 laps. And I'm about to do 20 more.
Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman is working out for you.
I got to admit I half expected to come home, and our stuff would be gone, and we'd owe somebody a lot of money.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
They don't know that Stewie's shirt is having an affair with Meg's trousers.
Her baby's due any day now and Ted just walked out on her.
I promised her I'd be on the next train. Poor Carol, all alone in that big house.
Carol... She the one with the Jacuzzi and the pool table?
Come on, Lois. When have I not been there for you?
We really need you to take the kids for just a couple of days.
In accordance with Megan's Law, I'm obligated to inform you that...
In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby to smother with all your unrequited love.
And as soon as the baby can crawl, it'll probably leave me too, just like my eight husbands.
Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted. I came back because I love you and...
It was so nice of you to come, Peter. You're so considerate.
A speed-limit sign that doesn't end in five or zero?
Teeth and some toenail clippings and we'll be ready for our date.
Carol, since Ted dumped you, can I have his shirts?
Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here any minute. We'd better get moving.
You gotta relax. You let that kid start calling the shots now and you're screwed.
Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.
You must be a parking ticket, cos you got fine written all over you.
Hey, there. I don't wanna come between you... or do I?
This is a song I've been singing for a number of years, and I find it grows truer and truer as time goes by.
I'm hungry for you, baby. Come on, walk with me, talk with me.
Don't worry. We're almost there. Peter, why are we stopped?
Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal. And... I guess I'll have fries.
If I have fries, is anybody else gonna have any?
I don't wanna be the only one eating 'em. I'll feel like a fatty.
All right, let's see what we have here. The baby's crowning.
All right, I'm just going to put on a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.
These don't feel like gloves at all. They feel like used needles.
But this is where I always keep the gloves. Maybe if I dig deeper.
No, just feels like more needles. That's the craziest thing.
No baby, but it looks like Carol's blowing a bubble.
But she has a penis. We'll have to do something about that.
Honey, you were fantastic. And you were so cute when you were holding it.
I know. I didn't wanna give it up. Let's steal it.
The best thing I've ever done is being a dad.
Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois. It's our pet rock.
We do that outside. Look at him. He knows what he did.
Hey, here's the broken condom that led to my birth.
And the resulting lawsuit bought us this house. You're my favourite mistake.
Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days of chafed nipples and episiotomies?
What's the most wonderful thing that could happen to this family?
A new baby. That's wonderful. Call me when Kojak starts.
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why the deuce would they want to replace me?
My cheeks are pinchable, my bottom is smooth, my laugh is heart-warming.
What happened to Bobby when they added Oliver to The Brady Bunch?
It can't happen. I was here first. Well, technically third, but no time for semantics.
This is Stewie country, and I intend to keep it that way.
As God is my witness, from this day forward, Peter and Lois shall not conceive.
My God, I thought I had more time. I've got to stop them.
Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream! I saw the bo...
Blast! What is that name again? Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!
We can still do it. He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.
If you say That's what she said once more, I'll pop you.
We were keeping it a secret, but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.
Fat man, we'll see if Lois wants to have sexual relations when she finds lipstick on your collar.
Yes, you're looking for a bad time, that's what you're after.
You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad and you don't care who you get it from, because you have no self-respect, and that gets you off, doesn't it?
And you got it all over your father's favourite shirt. Go to your room.
Make any joke you want. You know I look good.
Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time spent keeping people from having sex!
I want you kids to go and drink the antifreeze in the garage.
I'm gonna chug it all so there's none left for you.
I've had it with these interruptions. All we want is time alone.
You kids go to your rooms for the rest of the night.
I don't wanna go to my room. There's an evil monkey in my closet.
Very well, then. If I can't stop them from the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.
As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate of every sperm in Peter's body.
Just enough time to obliterate all those little potential usurpers.
Very well. Through the lips, over the gums. Look out, testicles, here I come! Lois You can't spell love without L-O You can't spell is without I-S You can't spell silo without Lois
My God. Either they're watching Batman or they're doing the do.
If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.
It's going to be a shame to destroy such a worthy adversary.
Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be able to do away with that red-headed woman.
What the...? How the devil do you know about Lois?
You've seen that little gleam in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?
You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too. What else do you hate?
People who send pictures of their families as Christmas cards.
I should embrace the idea of having a little brother.
After all, it's obvious we'd make quite a formidable team.
Dear God! I'll never get out of here in time.
It worked. You've got to get down there so you can be born.
When you're born, don't let the doctor slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.
It's been a long time since we had such a wonderful night.
It'll be impossible to spend time together like this if we're raising another child.
I thought, you know, Brian would do a lot of the work.
I don't know. I mean, Stewie alone needs so much attention.
No, no, no! Come back here this instant, you fat bastard, and do her!
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I'm having a birthday party. I was hoping you could come.
But I hope the cake's better than the last party I went to.
I wanna get Barbara a really nice gift. What kind of gifts have boys gotten for you, Meg?
I read a book saying women are from Venus, so here's what you get her.
Layers of sulphuric acid, viscous surface rock, and coronae, which seem to be domes over large magma chambers. Here's five dollars.
That's OK, Dad. I was thinking about getting a paper route so I could buy her gift myself.
Oh, boy. I remember my first job. I was in a folk music trio.
You've been pitching that for an hour. It's not an attractive name.
I suppose we're also not going with Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Lawry's Seasoning Salt.
Hand me the paper, so I don't need to use my grabber.
Got a nice tip for you right here in my pocket, but my arthritis...
Why don't you reach in and fish it out for yourself?
That's OK, mister. I don't collect till the end of the month.
It'll make you smell like Elizabeth Taylor. So I guess you'll smell of bourbon and Vicodin.
It's this girl. I can't talk to her. It's like girls are a different species or somethin'.
Then you need to come on down to the cellar. I got a whole freezer full of Popsicles. Mm.
All right, then give me one of them horoscope scrolls and some Skittles. Financial transaction benefits you today.  Oooh!
Your parents are on their way, but since time is a factor here we'd like to get an ID quickly.
Hi. Excuse me, you guys. I'm here to pick up my son, Chris Griffin.
He's here to finger the guy who held up that store. Maybe you've seen him. Chris Griffin.
Wait a second, I got a picture of him somewhere. Here you go.
Hang on to that, I got a ton of 'em at home. I was gonna throw that one out anyway.
Chris messed it up by writing his school schedule and a list of his fears on the back.
We're so proud of you, Chris, for helping to put that horrible man in jail.
Our chance to put that showboating Canadian wench behind bars and you blow it.
We now return to the E! True Hollywood Story: ALF.
By the third season I was completely wasted all the time.
They had to cut the crap out of my fur before each taping.
Now over to Rhode Island State Penitentiary and Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. Tricia?
I'm at this maximum-security facility, where a ruthless thug has engineered a daring escape.
Sir, do you have any plans now that you're out of jail?
Yeah. I'm gonna go bang my girlfriend, and then I'm gonna kill Chris Griffin!
This man will stop at nothing. We're placing you all in the Witness Protection Program.
Is Europe an option? I've always wanted to spend a year in Prague teaching English.
Until we catch this guy, you'll be relocated to the Deep South.
Where the black guys are really lazy, and the white guys are just as lazy but they're mad at the black guys for being lazy?
Jenkins and I have been assigned to live here and watch your house.
I can't believe I have to change schools because of you. This is all your fault, Lardo.
I bet if we fixed it up a little bit, it could be a piece of crap.
You know you're a redneck when your gun rack has a gun rack on it.
Oh, my. Well, it's too hot to cook anyway. Peter, what's the upstairs like?
Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement and it has a hand in it.
I'm gonna plant it and see if a human grows.
Great. We're here five minutes and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.
I bet if we explore the town we'll each find something about it we like.
That's a great idea. I just gotta hit the can.
Hey, Lois? I don't get how this works. It's just a hole.
There's a service charge of a buck 50. Do y'all accept?
Mm. You smell like the inside of my momma's purse.
What are those dulcet tones? Why, this is the music of the angels!
Oh, I feel so deliciously white-trash. Mommy, I want a mullet!
Yeah, and you gotta get in through the window, like this.
He saw his reflection, thought it was him and drowned trying to save himself.
That's why Mom doesn't let me look in the toilet.
Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the mud harvest. Nice making your acquaintance.
That was Merle Haggard with I Kissed My Sweetie With My Fist. Next...
That was great! Next time, let's get Meg to be Boss Hogg and Chris can be Anus.
All right, that's enough questions for Megan. Time to hand back last week's spelling tests.
I'm glad you're having fun, but we need money. Have you thought about a job?
Yes, Lois, I have. But I've also thought about getting fired from that job.
Is that something you wanna put our family through? Think about that while I get a drink.
I learned at church that if you're good you go to heaven.
If you're bad, you go to a place where the dead believe they're still livin' and they pray for death, but death won't come.
You know, it's true. The best things in life really are free.
I don't know. Maybe Lois is right. Maybe it is time for me to get a job.
So, Peter, where do you see yourself in five years?
Y'all interested? We take turns being sheriff. You just hang out here, eat pie and get drunk.
I kn... I know. There's nothin'... nothin' to, um... to, uh... um... uh... Oh, boy, what's the word I'm looking for? Do.
Robert E Lee. I knew I'd find you here, where they seat the sorry-ass losers.
Ulysses S Grant, you invite me to lunch then show up an hour late, drunk?
I was busy lookin' for your wife, to give her the old...
I hereby declare victory in the name of the Confederacy.
That drunken idiot kicked your sorry asses south of the Donna Dixon Line.
We don't take kindly to that sort of talk, mister.
And I sure as shoot don't want your kid hangin' round with my kid.
And if you think I'm mad now, you gotta answer to them Civil War survivors.
Wait! Look over there! It's an interracial gay couple burning the American flag!
That sucks, cos I really like spending time with you.
Them Griffin boys better grow some wings, or start flappin' their arms.
Man, was last night weird. I kissed a boy! But I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam.
You said it out loud. I heard you in the other room.
The weird thing is, kissing Sam kind of felt right.
But I don't know if I can face him again. Brian, what should I do?
I haven't been this confused since the end of No Way Out.
Oh, well, if it's for Meg, that's a whole other story. Here's her address.
Um, listen, Sam. I like hangin' out with you and all, it's just that I don't want a romantic relationship.
But I'd like it if we could still be friends.
Even warmer today. Met her on my CB, said her name was Mimi
Come to earth When I went to meet her, man, you should have seen her
" Twice as tall as me, three times the girth
Loves to eat A big old Buddha belly and her breasts swing past her feet My fat baby loves to eat My big ole fat-ass baby loves to eat
You know, the kids are gonna be at that town social for a while.
Hello, Mrs Griffin? Yeah. Shh! Shut up! You guys, shut up!
Listen, promise you won't be mad, and it's probably nothing, but you know that criminal who's after your son? He might know where you guys are.
What?! Peter, that criminal is on his way here to kill Chris. We gotta call the sheriff.
Sheriff's office. Yes, this is Peter Griffin. I'd like to report a criminal coming into town.
I'm sorry, could you repeat your name? Yes, it's Peter Griffin. G-r-i-f-f-i-n.
Yeah, well, see, I kinda pissed off the whole town at that Civil War re-enactment.
Oh, and to the owner of a John Deere tractor, you're parked on top of a pig.
Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking to girls. That's why I ran away from you.
You didn't have trouble talkin' to me when you thought I was a boy.
You wanna go down to the old town bridge and make out?
Dang, I hope her brother don't already have dibs on her.
You know, my brother is the one he's here to kill.
I hated TJ Hooker. And I never actually saw McMillan and Wife, although I was aware of it.
And after I said all Southerners have bad teeth and the gum disease known as gingivitis.
We take care of our own. And as long as y'all live here, y'all are Southerners too.
I think the lesson here is it doesn't matter where you're from, as long as we're all the same religion.
We didn't have no money for a present, so we all just spit in a jar.
Next time I see a dead guy, I'm gonna poke him twice as hard for both of us.
Uh, yeah, I was just wondering... uh... mm-hm... where the newspaper boy was.
Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple of days. Wonderin' if you're ever gonna come back.
I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates.
Can't we all just run around in a disorganised fashion?
If we don't adhere to a schedule, we won't see everything.
There you are. Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr Pig.
Oh, my, someone's awfully rude. Oh! My fanny is not on the menu! What?
What the...? Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh!
Oh, here are the marsupials. Peter, what the hell are you doing?!
Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.
I am going to kick your ass. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Gorgeous. We sit here and force small talk while they have the time of their lives.
Wow. Does it really smell like cook...? God! She farted and it went down my throat!
Sorry, guys. Lois is making me visit the in-laws this weekend.
Why does she bother? Me and Lois's old man have never gotten along.
Figure out what he likes and study up on it.
That's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now.
The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. I'd be more apathetic if I weren't so lethargic.
Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah, can I have a copy of Jugs?
In French, when you want to say yes, you say oui, oui.
You gotta be kidding me! Oh, my God! That is hysterical!
Oh, man! And what do you say for no? Doo-doo?
I'll be right back. I gotta go take a wicked yes.
I'll give you all my Star Wars cards if it is.
Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man.
I know. It's just, I should be able to control my baser instincts, but lately I've just been having these urges.
Why don't you come to my parents' house? The fresh air will help you relax.
Mm, I know where I go when I want to relax.
I said, I know the guy that... Oh, I'll tell you later. I love this song.
Thanks, but I think a quiet weekend by myself is just the thing I need.
I know someone who's getting a gift certificate for liposuction in her stocking.
Oh, so I should treat him like a high-class whore.
I'll tie a bowline in there and make one. That should hold her.
Carter, did you tell your son-in-law he's not supposed to swallow the wine?
He said he'd give me a hundred dollars if I took off all my clothes off.
Thanks for bringing me. This is just what I needed.
I'm glad. It seems like everybody's having a lot of fun.
You idiot! I'm never taking you to my country club again!
He walks up to the premier of China and says Dong, where is my automobile?
I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd, but it's worse than before.
This sucks worse than that time I was on Survivor.
How dare you wash your clothes in our drinking water, Bebe?
Now how are we gonna survive in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?
Peter's been trying really hard to get you to like him.
Give him another chance? Let him join your poker game?
I'd rather be stuck in an elevator with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried,
Carrot Top, uh... Sean Hayes... Oh, you get the picture.
OK. You know, maybe later I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place and introduce her to that mulatto boy who looks a lot like...
Brian, come here and meet Sea Breeze, my prize-winning dog.
Isn't she a perfect specimen? Look at these legs and that beautiful coat.
Feel the heat coming off of her genitalia. You could roast a marshmallow.
That's how you can tell she's a champion. Go on. Put your hand there.
Yes. Yes, she is a beautiful dog. And that's OK.
I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.
I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What have you got?
You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's a million a year?
That's the first time any of us have beaten Ted.
I noticed it when he did an interview and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.
Me too. I gotta be at Disneyland. We're ethnically cleansing the Small World ride.
There's gotta be a ton of fun stuff we could do.
Oh, man, there's a toll booth. Anybody got a quarter?
Man. Looking up at the sky just makes you feel so small.
Yeah. I mean, if God created all this, who created God?
And I just want to say... I'm glad you married my daughter.
Nothing to worry about. Sea Breeze is a sure thing.
No, he's awkwardly positioning himself... Now he's violating Sea Breeze.
Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am about this. I don't know what came over me.
I'd turn my back, but I've seen what you do in that situation.
Now, Carter and I have a polio match to attend.
Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?
She's fine. Sea Breeze will be able to race again.
I just want you to know I am going to do the right thing here.
I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting it on with your dog.
Oh... Oh... Oh, boy... Oh... Oh... Oh, God. Agh. Agh.
See. I made a picture of you and me out of glue and macaroni.
That means a lot to me because you made it.
Peter, do you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?
This is the room. The light switch is here. It's mostly for show.
There's your Murphy Bed. Don't mind the Epsteins. They keep to themselves.
We're going to see Bobby Darin at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?
This is the bathroom. Watch out, we got some bad roaches.
I'll cut you up so bad you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.
Hey, Lois. Hubba-hubba. Whoa, Lois, you put on a few, huh?
That's all right, I don't think he was the one. Let's go get sundaes.
We all really miss you. And Peter talks about you all the time.
I should go. Take this. It's probably not a good idea for us to meet any more.
Daddy swore he'd track you down any way he could.
This is Tricia Takanawa live where police have discovered the whereabouts of Sea Breeze, the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker is already on the scene.
Hello, this is Tom Tucker's evil twin Todd Tucker out to destroy his brother's reputation.
I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.
My face is on the news. Your father won't let me see the dog carrying my puppies.
Brian, don't let him get to you. Peter, come out of that thing!
He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him that's getting to me, it's your father.
I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.
I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to take care of the puppies.
They're not his to take care of. They're my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.
My father wasn't there for me, but I'll be there for my kids!
Please stop this. Brian has every right to see his puppies when they're born.
I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for this!
Do you remember an incident at a South Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996?
Waa! Waa! You like that, huh?! You like that?! Waa!
You just tune this out, don't you?! Waa! Well, tune this out! Waa!
I was angry because my Moon Over My Hammy was overcooked and...
I also have your rental records from the Quahog Video Store.
I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the store for taping over movies.
It's his sled. It was his sled from when he was a kid.
But first I want you to testify against that horny mutt of yours.
That's too bad, because Bill and Michael want to see you again.
Oh, man, and his arms stretch out to next week!
Your Honour, Peter Griffin would like to take the stand.
Mr Griffin, which of the following two phrases best describes Brian Griffin?
Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you stare at it long enough, you see something?
Now, isn't it true that you told my client that Brian is a menace to society and should never be allowed to see his children?
If I was half the parent he is, I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...
I've heard enough. I do believe that Brian would be a successful parent.
If he was to repeat his actions, he would be setting a bad example for his puppies.
Therefore, I grant Brian custody with the condition that he be neutered first.
You're almost there, Sea Breeze. Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them.
This is like a Greek tragedy where a man chooses between himself and his children.
Of course, you'll be playing the role of Sans Testiclese.
Sure you want to go through with this? You could have puppies with another dog.
And maybe with a condor! Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.
I am not looking forward to what you're gonna be like once they do this to you.
But I can't eat it because then I'll get fat.
Actually, I... I was kind of looking forward to being a dad.
Hey, you know what's funny? I always thought that dogs... laid eggs.
I got the whole day planned. First, we see the primates.
Can't we all just run around in a disorganised fashion?
If we don't adhere to a schedule, we won't see everything.
There you are. Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr Pig.
Oh, my, someone's awfully rude. Oh! My fanny is not on the menu! What?
What the...? Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh!
Oh, here are the marsupials. Peter, what the hell are you doing?!
Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.
I am going to kick your ass. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Gorgeous. We sit here and force small talk while they have the time of their lives.
Wow. Does it really smell like cook...? God! She farted and it went down my throat!
Sorry, guys. Lois is making me visit the in-laws this weekend.
Why does she bother? Me and Lois's old man have never gotten along.
Figure out what he likes and study up on it.
That's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now.
The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. I'd be more apathetic if I weren't so lethargic.
Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah, can I have a copy of Jugs?

Hey, you know what's funny? I always thought that dogs... laid eggs.
I don't wanna go on a rant here, but America's foreign policy makes about as much sense as Beowulf havin' sex with Robert Fulton at the first battle of Antietam.
When a neo-conservative defenestrates, it's like Raskolnikov filibustered dioxin monohydroxanate.
What the hell does rant mean? It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
That's my son out there. I taught him how to wipe.
It's those sirens. They had us all completely under their spell.
Nice job tonight, Chris. You wiped the floor with that towel.
Yo, did y'all check me when that hottie was all up in my Kool-Aid?
I was lookin' to break off somethin', but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank and she's all about the bling-bling.
Meg, start at Psalm 41. Don't stop readin' till I tell you. The power of Christ compels you!
It's just a phase. You've gone through a few yourself.
I walked into the kitchen and sat at the table.
I grimaced at the questionable meal Lois had placed in front of me.
I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but somehow I think she knew.
Lois had always been full of energy and life, but lately I had grown aware of her ageing.
The bright, exuberant eyes I had fallen in love with were growing dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life.
I awoke several hours later in a daze. I was brought up on the streets, no moms and dads I had to fend for myself with my own two hands But today I'm hurtin', and I'll tell you why I got a hangnail hangin' from my cuticle A hangnail It ain't beautiful It hurts like a bitch that I did last night
Just layin' back in the cot, peepin' at this here homey. Yo, Pops, gimme some cheddar.
Some player-haters be throwin' salt in my game, grillin' me over my gear.
There they are. And now to infiltrate this coven and learn their mind-control secrets.
But it still sucked worse than ever. What's wrong with you guys?
Chris starts with all this Yo, yo, yo stuff, and I don't know what he's talkin' about.
So I started beatin' him with a hose. Then my arm got tired, so I came here.
Perhaps Chris has adopted another culture's mannerisms because he doesn't know enough about his own.
I never thought of that. I should teach Chris about his Irish roots.
He's wakin' up. Get him back to the bus station.
Dad, I don't wanna be here. I wanna be chillin' with my homeys.
Now, Chris, it's important you learn about your Irish heritage.
Archaeological evidence shows Ireland was very different before the discovery of alcohol.
Gentlemen, today we, Ireland's top scientists, have found a way to convert our entire population to pure energy.
Hey, Michael McCloud's just invented a new kind of beverage.
That's more like it, son. Today we're gonna learn about the Griffin family history.
It's just a place where homeless people come to shave and go BM. Let's go inside.
Way to go, son. Here's a picture of your great-great-granddad, Osias Griffin.
In 1840, Nathaniel Nate Griffin used to groom horses. What the hell...?
I gotta say, the man in this book does look an awful lot like you.
The Diary of Nate Griffin. May 7th, 1836. I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt, when she let out a fart right near my face. So I took her head and stuck it by my butt and blew a huge fart right back at her.
Now I can wear clothes that actually show off my big butt.
I gotta tell Bonnie I'm sleeping with a black man!
Oh, my God! Update! Exclam! Scott Martin just asked me out again!
Oh, my God. This is date three. Are you gonna let him get to second base?
I think that would be a bad idea. And I know something about bad ideas.
I'm telling you, Juice, she's screwin' around behind your back.
And if I were in your Bruno Maglis, I wouldn't stand for it.
Have yet to discover the secret of their mind-control powers.
Also trying to comprehend their obsession with the homosexuals from *NS YNC.
Cleveland, you got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
Sure. I was just goin' for a ride. Hop on.
Yeah, but the problem is, I got no idea how to be black.
Except for not smilin' when I get my picture taken.
Well, you should go out and commingle amongst your newly found brethren.
You're right. I should be hangin' around more black people like myself. Thanks.
Who here used to wear a lot of Jheri Curl?
Yeah, that's right. Y'all know that Exxon Valdez thing? That ain't how it happened.
Although I think Connie Chung might've been substituting for him that night.
Well, 'bout time for me to be hittin' the old dusty trail.
Oh. Found the emergency exit. was named to the Supreme Court of the US.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Welcome. For our first order of business, Cleveland has an announcement.
Yesterday I received reparations from the family that enslaved my ancestors.
The family has become poor white trash since then, so they only gave what they could.
I share them with all of you in the hopes that one day your wounds may be healed as well.
Gentlemen, please. Please. Judge me not by the colour of my skin.
I was there when George and Weezy moved on up to the East Side.
But... but... but I was also there for the bad times.
When Florida lost James to that tragic auto accident. Oh! Oh!
And I was there when Tootie got those terribly painful braces. Oh, yes.
And when Arnold Jackson got beat up by the Gooch, I was there.
So before you decide that I don't belong here, remember this: I was there!
Way to go, Peter! You tell it like it is!
They surprised us with a visit after I told them about your recent discovery.
Yep. I even got my own posse. Big Dog, T-Bone, Shades, go make some sandwiches.
I think Chris and Meg should know the Pewterschmidt side of their ancestry too.
Did you know the Pewterschmidts were among the first colonists?
Now, kids, don't be taken in by the man. Stay black and proud.
Nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took care of in exchange for doing a few chores.
Well... 'bout time for me to be hittin' the old dusty trail.
Babs, it's time we went to bed. Things'll look better tomorrow.
Come here, kids. Give Grandma and Grandpa a kiss good night.
You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never break my spirit!
There must be some clue to the source of their mental manipulation techniques.
Your Body and You. Every four weeks, it's entirely normal for every young woman to...
Oh, my God! Oh! That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life!
And what happened with the pyramid? I almost broke my neck!
The pyramid. Of course! That must be the key to their power.
Mission objective: Eliminate Cindi and take her place at the top of the pyramid.
They're getting nude! I mustn't watch. It's not the proper thing... Whoa!
And look at Lisa in all of her curvaceous glory.
It appears my wee-wee has been stricken with rigor mortis.
It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's my slave name. Call me Kichwa Tembo.
There must be something I can do to make it right.
Actually there is. I want reparations, just like Cleveland got.
I will not give you an apology, and I assume Rice Krispie treats is black slang for money, so here's $10,000.
I expect you never to mention this ugly business again.
Not enough? Make it 20. How do you spell Kichwa?
This just in: Slave-owner descendant Carter Pewterschmidt has paid $20,000, or two million pennies, in reparations to a local black man.
Well, the money helps, but I'll always feel my ancestor's pain.
Hey, from down there, does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?
Lois, come and see what I did with the money your dad gave me.
Oh, my God! You turned the den into Pee-wee's Playhouse? Come on, get up Knock off your nappin' It's a crazy, messed-up place where anything can happen There's a chair that freakin' talks There's some fish that give advice Holy crap! It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse
That reparation money should be going to a black charity.
The king of cartoons will be here in five minutes, and I won't have you embarrass me.
So it's agreed: We'll keep on pretending to like pigs' feet just to confound the white man.
Uh, sorry I'm late, you guys. The white man was makin' me his bitch.
Peter, we know about your selfish squandering of your reparation money.
I shared mine. You, however, have given nothin' back to the community.
No one wants to sit with me. It's like I'm a freakin' leper.
Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't spell your name with that insufferable i.
Oh, and that cockadoodie smiley face you use to dot it. You sicken me!
Nate Griffin. Oh, my God, you're haunting me because I've been a terrible black man.
No. If I had, would I have slept with your white great-great-great-great-granny?
You see, Peter, the most important thing is how a man acts. You see what I'm gettin' at?
You think I should do something good with that reparation money.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry my wife's ancestors made you suffer so much.
Don't worry about me. If it makes you feel better, I peed in their cereal every morning.
Look, we're just going to have to go on without her.
That's enough of that. There's a hunting knife under your seats. On my command... Argh!
Argh! You idiots! I had them! Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.
Listen, uh, as many of you may know, I recently came into some money.
That was very generous. Look how happy you've made everyone.
It just goes to show you, Lois, it doesn't matter if you're black or white.
Sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely?
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy Alan Adler, David Preslack, Julie Axlerod, Shep Sutton, Scott McCormack.
Those were the people who were mean to me in junior high. Tomorrow, high school.
Finally we go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa for 60 seconds of filler.
I'm here on Spooner Street where several Quahog families are holding a car wash to raise money for an organ transplant for young Paul Lewis.
With me is one of Paul's classmates, Chris Griffin, who helped organise this charity event. You're a very thoughtful young man, Chris.
So you want the full wash... Oh, you've got a nick there. I can probably get that out for you.
If you want to go with a scent, I've got PB and J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy.
I say we buy 26 dollars' worth of ice cream and just pig out.
We can dish, talk about who's getting fat. We'll be great big bitches.
You gotta put up signs and wait two weeks for someone to claim it.
He wore a Jimmy Carter mask, like the robber in that Keanu Reeves movie.
The other guy in this movie looks like Kurt Russell.
Well, the money's the important thing. Now Paul can get his...
Here's to Joe, who helped little Paul get a new liver and, barring a massive infection, a new lease on life.
So, um... the 26 dollars would probably be safe in my room.
Right. Probably get lost among the pin-ups of Justin Timberlake and Tom Cruise and...
Blast! Who the devil do the teenagers like? Morgan Freeman.
We can't keep it in my room cos there's an evil monkey that lives in my closet.
Shame on you. You march over there and cheer your old friend up.
Don't listen to that sissy. Grab a beer and watch the game.
Come on, Joe. Cheer up. What do you say you and me go roller-ska... bike-ri... jump ro... go lay on the grass?
Peter, the other day was the first time I've ever lost a perp.
It was also the first time I've really felt handicapped.
I've made up my mind about this. I'm quitting the force.
Come on, Joe. You don't have to quit the force.
In local news, Quahog will soon play proud host to the Special People's Games.
If you and/or a friend are disabled and would like to challenge yourself, sign up today.
Joe, that's it! You gotta compete in the Special People's Games.
Gosh, I don't know, Peter. You really think I can?
Hey, I believed you could be a desk. Come on! I'll even be your coach.
Coming up, our expos on conveniently placed news reports in television shows.
Had a row with a fellow in the steam room.
I was in Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to Books on Tape. The Red Sox were in town, but I didn't care, because it was Tuesday and I was on my way to see Maury. He couldn't go to the bathroom by himself any more, but his indomitable spirit...
How does he check out, Doc? Is my boy ready to compete?
Um... I don't quite know how to tell you this, Mr Swanson.
God, I was standing out there for like 10 minutes!
You got anything to give him a little extra juice?
You mean steroids? Peter, haven't you seen what happens to those ladies on ESPN2?
They get big hair faces and their breasts become like flapjacks.
Aisle three next to the creams. Oh, I don't like saying that word.
Who are ya gonna believe? I got a freakin' halo!
Safe, huh? The skirt's trying to pull a fast one.
Let's see. Make-up, chewing gum, a picture of Meg in a two-piece swimsuit.
Oh, God! I pray this is not my first memory.
Cool it. I am not gonna put up with this racket for two weeks.
I'll hold on to the money. I'm a neutral party, so it'll be safe.
Hello and welcome to the Quahog Special People's Games. I'm Tom Tucker.
I'm Diane Simmons. It's a great day to be alive, Tom, able-bodied or not.
It sure is. Today we'll see some of our finest athletes struggle valiantly against God's twisted designs. You'll cheer, you'll cry. You might get a cheap laugh.
I know I will, Tom. In fact, by the end of the day, we may all be going to hell.
And now we turn our attention to the lighting of the flame.
We begin with the 100-metre dash for people afraid of yellow tape.
Listen, Joe. You and I both know you have what it takes to win this thing.
That gold medal is mine, pretty boy. You don't have a chance.
Don't let him push you around. You can do this.
You think you're so hot, fella? Well, I can do this.
Now the first decathlon event, the pole vault, where Joe Swanson takes his starting position.
Good to see your new fiscal responsibilities haven't interfered with your reading.
You're not gonna get the $26, and you're despicable for trying.
I thought we were just having an innocent conversation about literature.
We'll go to bulimic pie-eating in a moment, but first, decathlon frontrunner Joe Swanson will attempt the long jump.
For Swanson to take the gold, he'll have to win the final event, the 100-metre dash.
Tell your wife to come over to my place if she wants a little boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.
If I couldn't catch a two-bit criminal, how can I win a race?
It's un-American. Did George W Bush quit even after losing the popular vote? No.
Did he quit after losing millions of his father's friends' money in failed oil companies? No.
Did he quit after gettin' arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct at a football game? No.
Uh... You mean ha-ha Jerry Seinfeld funny, or Elayne Boosler bless-her-she's-trying funny?
I don't understand why he did that without me. We were gonna do everything together.
It was one cereal ad, Peter. Besides, he won the medal.
Coming to ABC, the simple story of a man and his chair:
Once a man at his physical peak, brought down by a cruel twist of fate.
Why don't you just ask me to lay down and die?
You'll never make it, Joe. Why don't you just give up right now?
Friday on ABC, followed by Dharma and Greg, but you don't have to watch that.
Joe wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for me. How come he's gettin' all the glory?
It's my new passport. Why are you opening my mail?
You weren't planning on going somewhere with our $26, were you?
For God's sake, I just had the damn thing renewed.
Fess up or I'll do to you what I did to John Lennon.
You want your money? Fine. I hope you all kill each other.
All right, I know how to settle this. Whoever wants the money, raise your hand.
Ho-ho. You're smarter than I thought. Give yourselves a round of applause.
Honey, I'm gonna be late tonight. I've got a hooker coming over.
I know it's late notice, but what about the pool guy?
Mr Tucker, I have just become handicapped like Joe Swanson.
I demand commercial endorsements and a TV movie based on me
I even got the first piece you're gonna run. Exclusive footage of my tragic accident.
Oh, no! A car going too fast to stop in time! Aieee!
Mr Griffin, you can't expect me to believe this. That was clearly a scarecrow in your clothes.
Today we're here to honour Joe Swanson for pulling my one-eyed cat Bootsie out of the old stovepipe of my grandmother's cabin.
Joe Swanson won the Special People's decathlon and we're here to honour him.
Don't forget our deal, Lois. I sit through this and later tonight I get anal.
No matter how neat I want the house, you clean it.
You know, no one can win a gold medal by himself.
It takes friends. I want to acknowledge a special friend in the audience today.
Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul and Mary. Let's give him a hand, folks.
He challenged me to go that extra mile. And that man is Mr Griffin.
Your acerbic anti-white humour was a constant inspiration. Thank you, sir.
And last but not least, who could forget the fat guy?
Chef Paul Prudhomme, you get your Cajun ass up here!
Yes, it is. I put steroids in your water bottle before the last race.
All right. If anyone tries to lift the glass, the bell will ring.
I only had soup. I don't see why we should split the bill evenly.
Wake up! This is Mr Taylor. He's here to claim the money clip.
Peter, go talk to him. After all, you set out to make him feel better.
He's probably waitin' to be interviewed by Dan Rather or that dreadful Gene Shalit.
I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special is justice, served cold with a side of jail.
Order the souffl now, cos it takes 10 to 15 years.
I forgot it was really you who got me to believe in myself again.
Ironically, I severed his spine when I landed on him.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Don't put it in your nose. It burns like hell.
I'd like to thank the Senior Centre for decorating our tree.
So, you want to dress me up and trot me about like a circus poodle, hm?
Let me consult my agent, Mr Irving R Pointy Stick!
In a minute. Would you just look at this beautiful tree?
Every year, I look up at that star and I think of all of the joy and wonder that Christmas promises and that miracle that occurred on that silent winter's night.
Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus! Seven maids a-milking, six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk...
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, and you still haven't gotten a tree.
I told you, I'm on dipsaluscious vacation. What part of that don't you understand?
Come on, honey. It's the only thing I've asked you to do. Please?
The VCR hasn't worked since you tried to tape Monday Night Football.
Do you have the express written consent of ABC and the NFL?
If you get us a tree, I'll make sure Santa brings you a new VCR. Please?
Those jewelled bug barrettes. Not costume - real. Maybe you should write that down.
Honey, Santa got all his shopping done before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.
That's better than being selfish like Meg, right? So I should get more than her.
Merry Christmas to all and to all shut the hell up.
Before you sit, we're due at Joe and Bonnie's for eggnog.
All right, I'll kill your mother. God, when did Christmas become so complicated?
Yeah! It's perfect for all the happy active gingerbread men.
Except for the one with no legs! Look at the parents telling their kids not to stare. How does his pee-pee work, Mommy? I've got news for you, Becky. Not so well!
That'll be about as much fun as a lecture on ontological empiricism.
But you owe me. Later, under the mistletoe. Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am.
The gifts are in the trunk. Don't forget to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers.
Yeah, Peter, one of us has to be the designated driver, and I've already had four eggnogs, so I guess you're it.
Ha! That's a good one, Joe. Way to get into the spirit.
I'm a cop first, a buddy second, so don't think I wouldn't throw your drunk-driving ass in the slammer!
Stewie, honey, time for bed. You have a big day tomorrow, Baby Jesus.
I'd stroll you to a lake and hold you under until the bubbles stopped!
Very clever. Watching to see if I'm naughty are you?
That's about as funny as Sinbad. Not the comedian. He's hilarious.
The sailor. But then he was never meant to be funny.
Maybe we should set him up with another lemon snow cone.
No, thanks. The last one you gave me didn't taste like lemon. It tasted like...
Agh! No, damn you! Damn you, let me go! Agh!
It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa.
If he were omnipotent, he'd have the fortitude to show himself!
See? I'm just barking in the dark. No one here but me.
Now you go relax while I make my little Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.
I need you to take the presents out of the trunk.
All? One gift was for charity. The rest were for the family.
No, the rest were from the family. Were... weren't they?
Oh, crap. Since when did they change the meaning of for to from?
They sent you a card, but it said for Peter, so you must've thought it was from you, so you didn't, uh...
Yep. Now here's the plan: You'll enter through the air conditioning duct here.
There's a laser grid three inches above the floor, so you have to compress your body to the size of a sponge and slide underneath like some kind of weird amphibious dolphin.
So you understand, all these gifts were supposed to be for my family.
No, no, no, it's true. That remote control car was for my son.
And those barrettes were for my daughter, and... Where's my VCR?
Dang it, Buck! It's my turn to use the sexbox!
If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
You brought glad tidings to a family less fortunate than your own.
I am a bit irritated that I have to shop again. But at least some good came out of it.
So I can drink beer and watch TV? Because Kiss Saves Santa is on.
Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out.
You can watch all the TV you want... just as soon as we get back from the mall.
I just want this family to have a perfect Christmas.
We'll shop, come home, eat, and then it's off to the pageant to see little Stewie play Baby Jesus.
Yes, yes. By all means turn me into a child star.
Perhaps I can move to Californ-i-a and wrangle a three-way with the Olsen twins.
OK, Peter. We'll each take half the list to save time.
No, it's not possible! Sitting alone in this public setting?
Change me! I've leaked, and I won't face him wet!
It's good to see you. I would've been here sooner, but Lincoln gave me the wrong Gettysburg Address.
How about this having to sit still for 60 seconds to have your picture taken?
Everyone knows pterodactyls can't stand the screech of a guitar!
Ho, ho, ho. And what can I bring you this year?
Can any of us be good? Are our primal urges innate or the result of our choices?
All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium, then your wager is accepted. I will be nice.
All the clown fish and yellow tangs in the world can't help you now.
That's it? Fish food? That's your ace in the hole?
Lois, it was horrible. The fish were jumping all over my eyes and in my nose, and one of them muttered something anti-Semitic.
We're almost home, honey. Look. There's the star on the town Christmas tree.
Gold? I thought we agreed on a $5 limit here.
Look, we'll put everything together and put all our names on it.
My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?
Someone who cares enough about physical comedy to put his family at serious risk.
This is a night for magic and wonder and joy.
OK, so a couple of things have gone wrong. But we can still have a great Christmas.
Jeez, kids. I was this close to losing it. But your mom's right.
Sure I am. Meg, honey, get me some paper towels.
Let's lose the bad tidings and find that holiday cheer.
You think all this goodwill falls from the freakin' sky? It doesn't!
So cook your own damn turkey, wrap your own damn presents, and while you're at it, you can all ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell!
Hey, I guess there's some magic in that old silk hat.
Just a second. You got something to say to me?
But does anyone take responsibility and make it happen? No!
You all expect someone else to do it for you, like Santy Claus or Mommy!
Dad, what happened to Mom? What if she never comes back?
If this is the way she's gonna act at Christmas, do we even want her back?
Which is better? Around the waist or off the shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?
Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty of me not to fulfil my obligation to Mother.
Thank God years ago I planted a homing device in her skull for just such an occasion.
This won't do any good. Let's see if she's at the pageant.
Great time last night. Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.
Hang on. Lois is only up there because we sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her.
Maybe if she sees the pageant, it'll bring her around.
As we all know, Christmas is that mystical time of year when the ghost of Jesus rises from the grave to feed on the flesh of the living.
So we sing Christmas carols to lull him to sleep.
How dare he say such blasphemy! I've gotta do something!
I guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humour.
I am the Virgin Mary. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
Good evening. I'm playing the role of Jesus, a man once portrayed on the big screen by Jeffrey Hunter.
You may remember him as the actor replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek.
Mr Hunter was good enough to die for our sins, but not quite up to the task of seducing green women.
Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is to spread goodwill towards all men.
The irony is that this is contrary to our nature.
So why do we do it? Because we are being watched!
And so we unselfishly think of others, assured that our good behaviour will be rewarded with love... and plutonium.
It's OK. Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer and enough tranquilliser to bring down a bull elephant.
Honey, you got a little some... You got a little... Oh, I'll get it.
You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR, and best of all, my own copy of Kiss Saves Santa.
You just practise that guitar, Santa. Next time we'll let you do a solo.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Me, too. I just saw Don Giovanni. In my opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.
Oh, yeah, re... cita... tive... is really, you know, where it's at.
OK. I guess I'll have the escar-got and a glass of chab-lis.
Don't slow down, Jonas. Keep the rhythm. Bum, bum, bum, bum Brian, your standards are ridiculously high You'll never find a girl unless you compromise so you can find your love I don't think I have to compromise a thing I'd rather be alone if someone doesn't get me How long has the coffee been on the burner? I could really use a cup about now Oh, it's not very fresh I meant to make more I made the mistake of watching Oprah She had on James Garner
Now back to The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams.
Oh, yeah, Steve. He's... new to the mountain. I met him down at the general store.
Look at that Grizzly Adams. Look at how confident he is, how majestic.
Oh, no, it's time I joined the ranks of great men with beards.
Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Because of all the magic tricks?
Brian's depressed. Could you take him with you to the laser rock show tonight?
Sure. That's one thing I'm good at - cheering people up.
Mr and Mrs Ramsey, JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy.
And I will not rest until I find her killer, or killers.
Oh, really, don't bother. Nothing's going to bring our baby back.
No, I insist. I will make it my life's work...
The next laser rock show will begin in 20 minutes.
You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show! Come on, cheer up, would you?
Binary code is a computer language in which words are translated into zeroes and ones.
Anything can be expressed in binary, as we demonstrate in this scene from The Miracle Worker.
You don't think this is amazing? When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair,
Hey, look at me. I'm a pole in a strip club! Oh!
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh! Hey, stop! False alarm! Agh!
If you're secure in your masculinity, you can answer a hypothetical.
Johnny Depp, cos he kind of looks like a chick.
Richard Grieco would probably appreciate you more. Not take you for granted.
Of course, with Johnny, you'd get financial security. I'd go with Johnny.
I'll meet you at The Drunken Clam. We'll tie one on.
God, a DUl. I can't believe this. I could actually go to jail.
It's OK. You'll get through this DUl and you'll be a better person for it.
Hold on. Don't disguise his alcohol dependence as a ticket to self-realisation.
You're not one to talk. Remember when I gave you apple juice and told you it was wine?
Now, come on. I'm being serious. I will be serious here for a second.
Are you gonna listen to me so I can tell you that I respect you?
Brian, I know this is a bad time for you.
And if I have any advice to give you, it is this: Grow a beard.
I wish you'd shave that thing. Beards are so ugly.
On the charge of driving under the influence, we find you guilty.
In lieu of jail time, I sentence you to 100 hours of community service.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join these two in holy matrimony.
If anyone objects to this union, speak now or for ever hold your peace.
I gotta take care of an old woman who hasn't been out in 30 years.
When I got caught at school with my hand down my pants,
I had to keep it there for a whole week. Ha! What a week!
Taking care of this old woman'll be like baby-sitting, with bigger diapers.
That deceitful woman told me I'd have to use the toilet.
Fie on the toilet! It's made slaves of you all.
I've seen it sitting in there, lazy, slothful porcelain layabout feeding on other people's doo-doos while contributing nothing to society!
Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here from the Outreach to the Elderly programme.
I like my tea at four, my dinner at six.
I take my bath at seven so I can listen to Paul Harvey.
You'll warm up my bath with quick bursts from the faucet during commercials.
Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into commercials. It's been 30 seconds.
Lois, it's horrible. I was cleaning her house all day.
It's the worst job I've ever had. Except for one.
Excuse me. Would you like to taste my smoked-meat log?
Is it gone? Agh! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
I'm Dr Goodman of the Quahog Ornithological Society, ironically dining in a restaurant that serves poultry.
Swallow. Look, just get rid of this bird, all right?
I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.
You have to wait until the bird departs of its own accord or you'll be prosecuted.
Then I'll have to call the judge, and that means you'll go to jail!
You're one phone call away from getting a human booster shot from a guy named Mali.
That's it. You're history, pal. No bird Frenches my wife and gets away with it.
I heard you drop that light bulb, too. That'll be 67 cents!
That's it! I've had it with you, you old hag!
You're a miserable, dried-up shut-in, trying to make everyone feel as bad as you do!
Why don't you do the world a big favour and drop dead?!
Hey, look, Lois. There are three of 'em, just like ours.
I'm AJ Benza. You won't find Pearl's name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't turn on a radio or television without hearing one of her trademark jingles. You're only healthy when you're tan So soak up all the sun you can With Copper... Coppertone
At her peak, Pearl Burton earned 26 grand a year, which, by today's standards, would be just under 49 billion dollars.
In 1961, Pearl used an appearance at Carnegie Hall to make the leap from jingle-singer to artist.
That's Habanera from Carmen. Oh, I've never heard it sung so beautifully.
No one has seen Pearl Burton since that fateful night over 30 years ago.
You should be happy. I'm doing the world a big favour!
Stop trying to talk me out of it! I'm a pathetic sellout!
You're the first person who ever complimented my Habanera. Thank you.
And then the cow came out of the barn. See? Look, there's the cow.
A mother knows when it's time for her babies to leave the nest.
Hey, they're free to go any time they want! Aah!
Those wings, you angel. That was fantastic. That was so incredible.
What do you want for dinner? I was thinking of making that lamb and rice you love.
Pearl, what I'd really like for dinner is to go out.
Brian, you know I can't do that. I haven't left this house in such a long time.
There's so much you've missed in the last 30 years.
In fact, allow me to fill you in. The '60s brought the hippie breed And decades later things have changed indeed We lost the values but we kept the weed You've got a lot to see The Reagan years have laid the frame For movie stars to play the White House game We're not too far from voting Feldman-Haim You've got a lot to see The town of Vegas has got a different face Cos it's a family place with lots to do Where in the '50s, a man could mingle with scores of all the seediest whores Now his children can, too You heard it from the canine's mouth The country's changed - that is, except the South And you'll agree No one really knows, my dear lady friend Just quite how it all will end So hurry cos you've got a lot to see The baldness gene was cause for dread But that's a fear that you can put to bed They'll shave your ass and glue it on your head You've got a lot to see The PC age has moved the bar A word like redneck is a step too far The proper term is country music star You've got a lot to see Our flashy cellphones make people mumble Gee whiz Look how important he is, his life must rule. You'll get a tumour, but on your surgery day The doc will see it and say Wow, you must really be cool
Like Pee Wee and his famous wrist Or Sandy Duncan's creepy phony eye
Neil Armstrong on the moon Neil Armstrong? Wait, was he the trumpet guy? So let's go see the USA They'll treat you right unless you're black or gay or Cherokee But you can forgive the world and its flaws And follow me there because You've still got a hell of a lot to see You've got a lot to see
Brian, I've missed so much! I wouldn't be standing here right now if it wasn't for you!
She's in here. Tell the disorderly when you're ready to leave.
That's a doctor joke we like to make. We also like Kevin Pollak.
I never should have made you leave. This is all my fault!
Aside from the truck part, this was the best day of my life.
I only wish we could have a little more time together.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Thanks for coming, Lois. Mark's wanted me to see his one-man show for weeks.
We had some real characters in my neighbourhood, like Frank the mailman.
Hey, Mark. The ants for your ant farm came today.
What a piece of self-indulgent crap. All the characters sounded the same.
That was awful. With practice I could act circles around that guy.
Oh, yeah? Well, put up or shut up. This Thursday, auditions for the Quahog School of Performing Arts.
Mark! Wow, what a journey! Thank you. Those three and a half hours just flew by.
Hey, Santos, Pascoal. You've done such good work today, I got a surprise for you.
Thank you. I was boogie-boarding and I got sucked out by the riptide.
My God! He was just floating out there by himself?
Yep. He was so grateful, he invited us all over for dinner tonight.
Cook anyway and we'll throw it out. I don't want you to get rusty.
Peter, my audition's coming up. Would you listen to my monologue?
Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it. ...Dr Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas.
Oh, drop the bomb. There's not a dry eye in the house. Keep goin'.
No. I'm gonna stop. Maybe we'll work on it later.
Well, just so you know, it was good, but I was also being generous.
Well, you little jaybird! You wanna tell your mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?
Oh, my God! She's got hair growin' out of her boobs and up to her head.
So you're the man who saved my husband's life. Dottie Campbell.
This is the back yard. That's premium blue-tip Bermuda. Real hardy, but soft.
The hot dogs and burgers are ready. Can I get you a beer, Peter?
Way to go, champ. Jeff plays varsity tennis for Saint Genevieve High.
Don't get too cocky. I had a big one like that when I was your age.
You were a show-off yourself, Dave. You brought it out on our first date.
At first I wanted you to fail. But then I realised you'd be out five days a week, which means I'd be free to throw some of my sexy parties.
Hi. I'm Brian Griffin, and this is from John Waltz's Leaving Wichita.
I saw Dr Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas.
See here! Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor with talent and passion.
Well, I did notice. I saw a man bare his soul up here.
His pain ran through my heart like an errant locomotive.
Well, it looks like we have to reconsider. Brian, we want you...
But your young friend would be perfect for our rising-star programme.
Stewie, how about you and, let's see... one of our veterans... Olivia.
You're gonna do an exercise we call The Life Cycle. Without using words, you're gonna act out your entire life from birth to death as I describe it.
Now you're being born. Ready? And burst through the placenta!
Now fast-forward. It's your first day of school. You're alone and scared.
Pull it back. The lady touched the bun and she's not wearing gloves.
Fast-forward. You're a businessman, you manage a lot of people.
Here comes Henderson. He lost the big account. You're mad.
Come on. Hot, hot. There it is. You got it.
And fast-forward. You're an old man now. You're on your deathbed.
Your son is holding your hand. You tell him you accept his lifestyle and regret humiliating him at his sister's wedding by calling him your other daughter.
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, gosh, that's funny. That's really funny.
That is so fresh. You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
I've never heard anyone make that joke before. You're the first.
I've never heard anyone reference that outside the programme before.
That's what she says on the show, right? You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
You've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation.
What a clever, smart girl you must be to come up with a joke like that all by yourself.
Any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me while we're hitting these phenomena at the height of their popularity?
I'd better go. So, um... would you wanna do something sometime?
Thank you. Thank you. That was, um... Me Farting by Chopin.
Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but you're a total bitch.
I'll tell you who won't. It starts with an O and rhymes with Bolivia.
She's such a frosty box. She won't work with anybody.
Stewie Griffin is also on the fence. If he and Olivia don't deliver at their reviews,
I'll have to kick their cute little bottoms out of here.
Stow the 'tude, queenie. You and I have a problem. Read it and weep.
I'll spare you the details, but the phrase garden variety appears a number of times.
Our evaluation's tomorrow. You need someone to work with, and I need someone to make me look good.
Linda Evans, we have a spill in aisle 9. Linda Evans, a spill in aisle 9.
Let's both answer at the same time. One, two, three.
Meg, did any of the neighbours see Jeff come over?
Mom! Come on, Jeff. Let's go in the other room.
Oh! Just step on these coasters on your way out.
Don't step on the hot lava. The carpet is hot lava.
How could you bring that naked kid to our house?
I'm sorry, honey, but we don't think you should see him any more.
I think it's easier on me cos I'm the one makin' the sound.
Next up is Olivia. Liv, what monologue are you doing for us this time?
I'm not doing a monologue. I'm doing a piece with Stewie.
You do Who's got a guy who makes her smile all day?
By the way, I'm not so bad to look at either.
You do Who's got the greatest love in the world?
You do Who's got a girl he'd like to one day undress? Give it a rest - I told you not until we're married
You do Who's got the greatest love in the world?
That's for you wearing purple pants with blue socks. Eww!
No secrets. I wanna share Stewie and Olivia with the world.
It's a great idea. I've always dreamed of becoming an actress.
That's not why I'm pushing Olivia. Is it suspicious that I said that?
Sure, Lois. Look at Elroy Jetson. He was a child actor and he turned out fine.
I don't wanna go home. Take me to Astro's grave.
It was a good crowd. They didn't notice you missed that F sharp.
Peter, was it unfair of us to tell Meg she couldn't see that boy?
Completely. We totally reamed her. Did you see that look in her eyes? She hates you.
There it is, kids. Your first marquee. Meet you inside.
Lead with strength, put your best foot forward, et cetera, et cetera.
Jeff! What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to see you.
We were wrong, Meg. If you like Jeff, we should give him a chance.
Yeah! In your face! In your face! In your face!
It took a lot of guts for them to do that. I'll see you later.
Peter, can I borrow your lawn mower? Agh... You got a towel?
Simon, would you be a dear and ask Stewie to dance on his own feet tonight?
Could you provide Olivia with a bucket so she can carry a tune?
The Providence Journal's critic is here. If we get a good review, the doors'll fly open.
Wait a minute. You're wearing ruby lipstick. You're painted up like some jezebel.
You're one to talk. You've been stuffing your diaper since day one.
Just because your breath reeks of rotten Lunchables doesn't mean mine has to.
I don't need this act and I don't need you. You've done nothing but hold me back. I quit!
I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia, this act is like Fire Island after Labor Day: Over.
Fine. I don't need you. I can manage my own career.
Yes. Yes, I'm quite capable of that. I've got my top hat and cane And a pocketful of miracles, pocketful of miracles
It's not easy living with my family. Bunch of characters, they are.
Like my father. Holy crap, Lois. Check out the freakin' log in the toilet.
What do you say, Bernie? Two nights at the old rate?
I told you before, kid, I can't book you without Olivia.
But that's the good news. We're back together. She's here.
Hi, Bernie. Glad to be back. Ask Stewie about his sexy parties. Ask Stewie about his sexy parties.  What were you thinking?
I guess the best advice I got was from Marty Scorsese.
I was having a problem understanding why I'd been taking abuse from this lower-ranking officer played by Chris O'Donnell.
And... he told me You don't have to understand it. Your character does.
I must be an absolute mess. The studio made me fire my make-up girl.
I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing. I heard some things...
If you're not busy... what say you and I get the old team back together?
Well, actually, I can't. I'm on my way to Hollywood.
I'm doing a three-episode guest shot on The Gilmore Girls.
He's a bad boy at heart, but there's some good in there, Olivia.
That's really good to hear, Stewie. Please, take care of yourself.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Some of this stuff... you wonder who would need it in bulk.
Please keep a close eye on him. Remember what happened last time.
You don't have to keep moving to the back. You can have as many as you want.
They got a great deal on pianos if you buy a four-pack. Meg, help me get these down.
Ross Fishman, is that really you? I haven't seen you since college. How are you?
You people at the Industrial Adhesives Corporation know how to make a tasty glue.
I'm keeping an eye on you. If Lois sees this, she'll kill me.
I can't tell you how wonderful it's been to see you.
It's a crime that it's been so long. We were so close.
So am I. Does that mean we're not allowed to stay in touch with old friends?
Tell you what. If you change your mind, here's my card.
You got to buy the cooler, too. That's how they get you.
The good news is they make a solvent that'll get us unstuck.
And I'm ashamed of myself that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me from rekindling an old friendship just because it was with a man.
Peter's not very understanding when it comes to you and other men.
Thank you. Thank you very much. This next one is for all the ladies out there.
I'm gonna call Ross and see if it's not too late for his offer.
Say it. Say I like cleaning your doody, Stewie.  Ha! Don't forget the taint.
TC, fly the chopper around the island. I'll talk to the women.
We'll need security to unlock the gate for me. OK, Tattoo?
Oh, Peter. I'm just... gonna go out for a few hours.
Lois, can you grab me a beer? Oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!
Maybe if you bought me nice clothes once in a while!
Peter Griffin, we know you're in there! Come out with your hands up!
The new police surveillance van. We're going on a beer run. Wanna join us?
Fooled ya! Come on. Let's go drink till we can't feel feelings any more.
It's got a cloaking device that disguises it as two homeless guys fighting over a wedge of cheese.
Oh, my God! That is Lois! Why the hell would she...
Just on weekends? To help pay for her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy?
Oh, your wife and children are beautiful. It's so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.
I'm glad you did, too. Was your husband OK with you coming?
Uh... Yes, he turned out to be just fine with it.
Please don't spit in my eggs. Please don't spit in my eggs.
Thank you for the eggs! I hope he didn't spit in my eggs.
Our armies are ready. We will leave the sewers and strike back at the humans in the overworld.
I'm glad we both found someone to make us happy.
I enjoy being with you, Ross. I'm having a great time.
Oh, my God! That's who that is. Ross Fishman, Lois's old boyfriend.
Probably that skank who needed a ride. Last time I do somebody a favour.
Oh, God! They must have heard me! Oh, God! I can hear me!
You were clean 15 minutes ago. Now you're just on vacation.
So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh? Well, two can play at that game.
Peter, I have been waiting for this moment for 25 years!
And look! Look! I left the toilet just as it was the night we went to the prom.
It's the little piece of you that's kept your memory alive.
You were going 65, fella. That's ten miles over the... Why are you holding his hand?
He lured me to the park with promises of candy and funny stories.
What a surprise that you would look me up! You always thought I was so handsome.
How far can you get this banana... I can't say it. She's looking right at me.
That's it! You're suffocating me with your jealousy. I can't take it any more.
I'm calling a marriage counsellor. I can't even have coffee with a friend!
Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me, Lois. Dance the dance of life!
I'd like to put video cameras in every room of your house so I can observe your uncensored behaviour.
Just like that show Big Brother. Except somebody'll be watching.
I've compiled an accurate cross section of your home life. Here are the results.
Chris, I'm watching the game. You know what to do.
This hurts me more than it hurts you. Ow! Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. Today he was out in the yard raking leaves. God, I wish he'd throw me into that pile of leaves.
Hey, what's everybody... Oh, my God! My diary! I hate you all!
No. It's step, hip, step, pivot. Are you trying to piss off the volcano?
Mr and Mrs Griffin, what I'm about to suggest may seem unorthodox.
I recommend a trial separation, during which time I advise that you date other people.
I realise this is upsetting. That's why I've invited Howie Mandel to lighten the mood by blowing up a surgical glove with his nose.
I know. But maybe the doctor's right. This time apart could be good for us.
I don't know. Splitting up didn't work too well for Pacman and his wife.
I'd sit here and chat, but I need to get back upstairs to Loretta because it's our anniversary and the getting's good.
When is it gonna be my turn? Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
You are welcome to stay as long as you like.
Thanks, Muriel. So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
We like to watch old movies while listening to Hotel California to see if it syncs up in a significant way.
Peter and I just separated. I feel like I need more time.
I guess it's better to go out with you than some sex pervert.
Oh. God blast it! Will you hold it for five seconds?!
So, Mr Griffin, how does it feel to be a bachelor on the prowl again?
It's not as great as you'd think. I don't have the same way with women that I used to.
I had a great time with you today, beautiful stranger. What's your sign?
You should try a video dating service. That's how Muriel and I met.
Let me show you Mort's tape. He was so charming.
Agh! Oh, my eyes! Could you please turn down that very bright light?
My name is Mort and I live with my mother. And I have very low standards.
It takes an hour for the solvent to take effect.
What takes an hour? We could watch Rita Rudner do five minutes of stand-up.
Thank you for being such a good friend and looking after me.
No problem. It's chilly out, so I brought you a jacket.
Muriel and I feel that you need to follow your therapist's advice and start dating.
We've set it up for you to go out with our niece.
Hi. Peter Griffin. We can go anywhere except the disco. They don't let me in any more.
Except that guy. But he's helping that woman tickle a midget.
It's times like this I wish they'd used me for stem-cell research.
It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again. Ha!
I just noticed. How often do you see a 17th-century well in this day and age?
Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap before they put you in anything decent.
The food here is fantastic. This is where I took Lois on our first date.
I'll go to the john and fire one out in five minutes. That should make room for dinner.
Martini for you and the usual roofie colada for your date?
No, no, no. I wouldn't bring... A glass of wine.
Wow! I wonder who she's here with. She could date any man she wanted to.
That sign in the bathroom about washing your hands, that's for the staff, right?
Oh, man! These all look good, every one of 'em.
It's OK, Quagmire. We're just doing what the therapist said to do.
Peter, I think it's great you're out with Jennifer Love Hewitt.
That's it! You have got to be the most vile, disgusting human being I've ever met!
And I have never been more turned-on in my life.
Hold on, toots! I don't care what our therapist says.
I won't stand by and watch my husband lock lips with another woman! Beat it!
And the flight was delayed, so the headphones were free!
I guess I finally understand how you can get so jealous sometimes.
Seeing her kiss you like that just made me crazy.
I guess we're gonna have to learn to control our jealousy... together.
What a couple of freaks. God, I need a drink.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy

Jolly Farm Revue. The latest indoctrinating pablum for children with not enough to do.
The sun has risen on another day in Jolly Farm.
Let's see what life's rich pageant has in store for us.
She has the voice of an angel! And a balcony you could do Shakespeare from.
Play your song, Melody Sheep, to aid the little ones' nourishment.
But play softly, for Pengrove Pig wishes to read aloud from his magic tome that holds every book ever written. It was difficult for the children of Ipswich when the lollipop famine cursed them...
How can you stand watching this? It's dreck and you know it.
Don't have the guts to respond, huh? No defence of this unmitigated crap?
Welcome to KISS Forum, Rhode Island Public Access's most popular show about KISS.
Is this Dennis De Young, lead singer from Styx? Come clean, man.
You jealous douche. How about I play Detroit Rock City and Come Sail Away and let's see how they stack up side by side. You want that, you high-voiced bastard?!
Hey, didn't see you come in. We're getting into shape for our tour.
Why don't you just sit in the corner, huh? Go on.
So if you're a KISS fan in the Northeast, come out for all five shows of what we're calling KISS-Stock!
Hell, the Northeast! At times like this I curse the fact that we live in French Polynesia.
The pair with the rip in the right butt cheek from stepping on 'em in the airplane bathroom when you had the trots?
No, with the hole in the left butt cheek from holding it in for two hours cos it was a long church sermon and I thought blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the vestibule and it sounded like Louis Armstrong.
Tell Mother Maggie what you want to be when you grow up.
Fighting with a dude at the Laundromat because he hit on my baby's mama? I should be there, not here!
Dad, can me and Meg stay up late every night when you're at KISS-Stock?
Do whatever you want. Just don't eat from the candy tree.
Nah. Since Jolly Farm Revue came on, he's been distracted.
My stupid parents are spending five days following stupid old KISS around. It's painful.
Not as painful as a tyre iron upside your head.
Hey, Stewie, what do you want for lunch? Dear stupid dog, I've gone to live with the children on Jolly Farm. Goodbye for ever. Stewie.
I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. The receipt's on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit, but I'm sure if you make a fuss, they'll give you a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's just I can't imagine when I would ever wear it. You know? I also left a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to, but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do, I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'II... Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did it have buttons? Hm. I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. OK, goodbye for ever.
You know, it might be chilly in London. I'm going to take the sweater.
Spit-spot, Albert Hall, meat and two veg, Big Ben, Dave Clark Five, pip-pip, cheerio.
Great. I'm stuck on a transatlantic flight with a petulant runaway. Could it get worse?
First of all, you can't get 'em open. Who are they trying to keep out of these?
And what's with the razor-blade slot in the bathroom? Do people really shave in there?
Hi. Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in the overhead bin here. Oh!
That wasn't so bad, was it? Did you sleep at all?
But where are its verdant fields, rosy-rumped maidens and bucktoothed solicitors?
About 3,000 miles that way. We're in the Middle East.
I've got Dude, My Car Is Not Where I Parked It, But Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt.
Camels for sale! This one owned by a little old man who only drove it to mosque on Sundays. Just had its knees replaced.
We'll have to distract him. Follow my lead. You and I are so awfully different Too awfully different to ever be pals
You're one to talk. You get a stiffie from Phylicia Rashad
Oh, one time. I've a style flair, just look at my hip hair
Bite me, Snoopy. There's not a whole lot that we've got to agree on Cos I love the strains of a classical score And I like that singer who looks like a whore
Doo doo doo doo doo doo dooie doo Your head's as massive as a meteorite
Oh, very funny. You have a weenie like a Christmas-tree light I'd bet money you'll marry a honey Who's pretty and funny, and her name'll be Ted
I work with what you give me. You might think we're in sync, but we stink as a duo Cos you get a kick out of carnage and guts And you get a kick out of stroking your...
We have no food, no water. Our camel is dead from exhaustion.
And I had named him and given him a back story.
Chucky had the biggest hump of all the local camels, and was picked on for it.
Then there was a drought, and Chucky went to the oasis at great risk cos he was like that.
He drank and stored enough water in his massive hump to slake the thirst of...
It's below freezing and getting colder. We're gonna die unless...
We have to slice open our camel's stomach and shelter in his entrails.
Wiping my feet. I don't want to track sand in.
Once you get it in there, you can't get it out.
I know it's gross, but when you're staring death in the face, you have no choice but to...
Actually, once you feng-shui the organs, it's kind of cosy.
'76. I don't think anyone knows more about KISS than I do.
I'm not sure I like the tone of your voice.
New York High School of Music. Their band before KISS?
Wicked Lester. What year were KISS on The Jim Nabors Halloween Special?
Recite the ad that brought Peter to Paul and Gene's attention. Drummer willing to do anything to make it.  Rolling Stone, October, 1972.
How in the hell are we gonna get out of here?
No more balloon for you! I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got last week.
Just wait until they have to suffer through Jesus Jones. Pee-yew!
Oh, Lois, here comes the best part. And have a wonderful... time
Is that it? No, no, it's... And... something something... all day
It's time to get up and put on your hat.
It's time to go on the balcony and address the people.
We gotta find the American Embassy to help us get home.
I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel with that intolerable woman, that fat slob and that insufferable dog.
Oh, you're right here, aren't you? I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm!
We've got three days until Peter and Lois get back.
You make the pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite them!
Why would Tom Bosley be on a train in Switzerland?
Munich was ze home of many great writers, such as Thomas Mann.
You'll find more on Germany's contribution to ze arts in ze pamphlets.
I'm not seeing anything about German history between 1939 and 1945.
On your left is Munich's first city hall, erected in 15...
What are you talking about? Germany invaded Poland in 1939.
Thomas Mann fled to America because of Naziism's hold on Germany.
I vill hear no more insinuations about Germans! Nothing bad happened!
I had to call a professor to tell me what phrase to use to describe it.
You've lived a lie all these years. You represented yourself as a KISS fan.
I wanted to share in all aspects of your life, but I just was never that big a KISS fan.
I should've guessed when you were willing to dress as Peter Criss.
No one wants to be Peter Criss, not even Peter Criss!
I guess I'm just not as cool as you thought I was.
You should get some hash, man. You can't go wrong.
Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly, and everyone will suffer the consequences!
I'd love to further pursue our palaver, but I'm not fluent in freaker!
So, I'm just gonna turn back over here, back towards my table.
Dude, I know what you're gonna say and I am so...
The only reason we die is because we accept it as an inevitability.
Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you so I will take my rage out on my own body.
We don't deserve to be under the same roof. Let's go.
All right. I guess I could fix us something when we... Chaim?
Lois! Do not address KISS unless they address you first!
Do you want me to sign the left or right?
Guys, this is the girl I told you about. I knew her before we formed KISS. Loose Lois!
I never realised you were Gene Simmons, the rock star!
Oh, wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy, and he's still nice.
Listen, Lois, what I said before... I've never been more wrong in my life.
Hey, did you ever find out what that button on my bureau was from?
Ah. I like that jacket. It looks good on him.
Pengrove! Pengrove Pig! Pengrove, I've come to live on Jolly Farm!
It's cardboard! There are no words, there are just... What is it you've drawn here?
It's Oswald Owl slammin' Mother Maggie in a Chinese basket, eh?
That's not your voice! Your voice is lyrical, like the strum of a lute!
I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me!
Hey, come on. You wanna get some ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right?
OK, let's go take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes.
We're back with KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins, and they got something to share.
I feel like I've done KISS, too. And it feels good.
Lois, you got any tips for the young girls in the audience?
The best advice I can give is, you never know who's gonna grow up to be famous, so make yourself available.
Many of you have written in with suggestions for episodes.
Enjoy. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Carol, how did Nick answer the following: The last thing I would ever give my wife is... blank?
Kids, these are your father's wishes. Get whatever you want.
That's easy. I wish I could see what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.
Be right there. I have to put on my face.
I gotjust the thing. I wish I had my own theme music.
Come on, that's classic travelling music. Try to enjoy it. Riding on a bus, riding on a bus, sitting next to bums There's an open seat, hope that isn't pee
Oh, no. I gotta fart, but I don't know which way to lean.
I know you might be a little concerned about me not having bones, but I gotta tell you, it's not that bad.
Look what I can do to Mary Worth's smug sense of self-satisfaction.
I invited some friends over to jump on him like a trampoline, but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe and his mom yelled at him when he got home and he beat me up at school the next day! It's all here in this pamphlet.
We have to learn to accept this, like one of those stories on Dateline where a family member suffers a horrible accident and is a burden on everybody.
They pretend to be happy, but they're dead inside. They're dead.
I might've screwed up my life but there's no reason to keep screwing up theirs.
Oh, so this is where all the waste and sewage winds up.
I got a stand-up comedy class at The Learning Annex.
Actually, I won't be a stand-up comic. I'll be more like an amorphous-blob comic.
I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you! See you at eight!
As you can tell from my husband, I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.
I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones. Will you sleep with me?
But Louie Anderson's eating the decorative soaps in the bathroom. Why not try him?
I'm a doctor doing an experimental procedure to give bones to ajellyfish, but I'd like to try it on a human. Interested?
The operation was a complete success! What are you going to do now?
I had the operation so I could go back to my family.
It's been so long. What if they don't love me any more?
Mostly. We picked up a drifter to fill in the torso.
Like I always say, a family of freaks is better than no family at all!
Let's go home! You know what's weird? This was covered by my HMO.
You dare me to pop a wheelie in this thing?
That doesn't sound safe at all. OK, I dare you.
Those big fangs. Have they ever shown him do somebody in, then feed on him?
You're asking if they've done a Sesame Street in which the Count kills somebody, then sucks their blood for sustenance?
How delightful! This toxic stew seems to have given me telekinetic abilities!
We've been given a gift. Whether that gift is Chris's fire conjuring,
Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll. ...my superstrength, or Meg's, um... super-amazing ability to grow her fingernails, we must to use these powers properly and not abuse them for personal gain.
Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me, would you watch him for a moment?
Then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take it away from you.
What does that cloud look like to you, honey? To me it looks like... rain.
I used thatjoke at work today. I'm the funniest guy at the office.
Oh, my God, *NSync is in town. If you get me a lock of Justin's hair,
I was in the neighbourhood - I'm gonna steal one of your beers - and I figured I'd stop by and say hi.
I am out of shape. I got a favour to ask you.
I got a hole in my car's muffler. I need to plug it.
Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something? I gotta drive.
Hey, did you bring enough breasts for the rest of the class?
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a lower-middle-class Irish family.
This is just one of many public disturbances caused by the Griffin family of Quahog, who seem to have acquired superpowers.
Very strange story, Diane. Coming up next: Can bees think?
Mike. Clearly the Griffin family is out of control, but not to fear.
Is that all you can do? Ow! That kinda hurt!
Is that bleeding? I guess it's all right. Ouch, though!
Our first demand: You will erect a statue in the town square.
It will depict Blair Warner admitting to Mrs Garrett that the poem she submitted for her creative writing class was plagiarised from a work by Emily Dickinson.
If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers, it could do the same for me.
No, no! That's not what Mrs Garrett's bosom looked like. It looked more like this.
Notice the sun spots at the top of the right can.
Excuse me. I have a message from the Quahog hospital.
I'll go to China to see if there's a cure. Nope.
Now, now. The doctor says I'll make a full recovery. But you learned your lesson.
I can't believe we let those superpowers go to our heads.
For now, we'll use our powers to help you get better.
Thank you. As long as I have Mrs Garrett's giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right.
Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club.
Cos all you need in life is your best pals.
Hey! We told you guys to quit snooping around here!
We need to find a story if I'm ever gonna be a big-time reporter.
All right, make like Siamese twins and split... and then one of you die.
When do we have the grape juice? I came for grape juice.
We have a new studentjoining us this morning. Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.
And remove her inflamed appendix before it bursts, causing sepsis.
I sure wish I could meet a brave fella like the guy in this book.
I bet you're too chicken to spend a night at the old Selberg place.
I ain't neither! To prove it, I'll go up there tonight!
Not to mention the myriad of bacteria and allergens from years of substandard housekeeping. It does not augur well for you.
Aw, zip it, egghead. You with your big words and your... and your small difficult words.
Wow! Any boy who would spend the night in that creepy place sure would be the bravest fella I ever met.
Yeah. Just thinking about her makes my testicles want to drop.
Quagmire's team takes the left side of the house and Peter's team will take the right.
Whoever's alive in the morning can bury his dead pals.
Do I have a cobweb in my hair? It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.
We say we spent the night and everyone thinks we're the bravest kids in the world. Especially Lois.
If we had a teacup, this would be like playing find the teacup in the bedsheet, like I do with my Aunt Sophia.
My God! Not only are ghosts real, but their innards are made of children.
Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here, and Istanbul is in this general area, then who the hell is that?
Ha! Get used to this sight, Diane: Guys running away from you.
You're so deep in the closet you're finding Christmas presents.
Remember our story: We tell Lois we both stayed all night.
I punched him so hard he ran crying all the way back to hell!
Our top story: Cowardly kids lay down rubber at the old Selberg place.
Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire were seen bolting out of the supposedly haunted house after one half-hour, leaving only their pride and twin trails of urine behind them.
Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house. We're not brave.
Sorry I'm late, darling. I was checking my stool for blood.
You said it! Let's you and me swear off 'em for good!
Quagmire, it seems to me we've each made another 500 million dollars.
Good thing we swore off women so we could accumulate this vast wealth.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
Mr Shackleford says if I don't learn it I won't be able to function in the real world.
OK, you gotta go down the road past the old Johnson place.
You're gonna find two roads, one parallel and one perpendicular.
Keep goin' until you come to a highway that bisects it at a 45-degree angle.
Math, my dear boy, is nothing more than the lesbian sister of biology.
Well, I was gonna try to sell you some Handsome Cream, but I can see you already bought out the store.
So perhaps you'd be interested in something every homeowner cannot be without: volcano insurance.
According to my uncle, who's a real whiz with volcanos, a volcano is coming this way.
$200?! That's more than I spent on all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.
OK, just a quick incision here and we should be all done, Mrs Wilson.
Oh, don't worry, honey. We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.
Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny - he fought in Vietnam, he's an exorcist, but there is one thing that terrifies him.
Oh, Midge. You're my third best friend in the whole world.
Peter, did you take the money from the family jar?
That's what you said when you talked me out of getting cloud insurance.
Look at them up there. Just plottin'. Picking their moment.
Peter, that was our emergency money. And your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.
That's only to fool the man from the draft board.
I swear, sometimes I feel like I'm married to a child.
Except Milk, milk, lemonade, around the corner fudge is made.
Watch who you're calling a child, because if I'm a child, you know what that makes you?
A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and be lectured by a pervert.
Can you believe it? Lois thinks I'm bad with money.
She's got a point. You're the white version of a black guy who's not good with his money.
That guy is to money what Miss Ann-Margret is to...
My accountant Larry Rosenblat just got me a huge tax refund.
And tickets to Bring In 'Da Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk.
The noise was good, but I thought they phoned in a lot of the funk.
Wait. Rosenblat? Greenstein? You're saying I need a Jewish guy to handle my money.
Well, yeah, not the retarded ones, but why would you even say that?
For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's edgy and there's offensive. Good day, sir!
Mother, you know how I hate asking for money, but...
No, Mother, I do not think I'd be better off married to a chimp.
I don't care how well that chimp across the street is doing.
I guess you can tell him I said hi. But don't make me sound desperate.
I gotta get a Greenstein or a Rosenblat of my very own.
Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car just broke down. May I use your phone?
I prayed for you, Max Weinstein. And here you are!
OK... Listen, uh, thanks for letting me use the phone.
I'll try, but I don't know why you think I can get your money back.
Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages. You're Jewish; you're good with money.
I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from marching in my parade. Now get my money.
I'm not in right now. Please leave a message. Beep!
Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi, this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...
Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed this contract and it offers no cover at all.
And down here in small print it says He's signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it.
See, here's your rainy-day money, and I balanced our chequebook too.
I'm gonna call my mother right now and tell her to tell that chimp across the street...
Look how low I've sunk. Taking credit for something a smart Jewish person did.
It is the white devil that has propagated, exacerbated, instigated...
God, what was I thinking when I agreed to this?
This is so degrading. This is worse than the time I was at the Friars Club and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.
Lois, I appreciate the marshmallow and fish casserole, but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.
Where was it you graduated from again? Hm? The University of Duhhhh?
They built the pyramids. You'll have to excuse Peter. He can be tactless sometimes.
I was so sorry to hear that your father passed away.
Yes. It spread through his body so fast, but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...
Well, there's only one thing that'll top a great dinner like that... Operation!
Thank you, but I can't stay. It's Friday. I've gotta go to Temple.
They better not be expecting money. I gave at church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.
Peter! Max, it was nice of you to invite us along.
Your husband's got a good heart but his views on Judaism are misguided.
It's not that I have ideological differences, I'm just not a hat person.
Hey, I didn't know the principal of Meg's school was Jewish.
Hey, there's Bill Nye the Science Guy. And half of Lenny Kravitz.
Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.
Oh dear. Sister Mary Joseph, it appears Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.
And on this day, the Sabbath, we gather here to...
Well, that was so nice. A good sermon and such beautiful songs.
But here in our little village of Anatevka, you might say each one of us...
Mr Weinstein, I thought you were gonna help me with my homework.
Sorry, son, I have to go. But I'm sure you'll do just fine.
I dunno, Max. The kid's not exactly an honour-roll student. Watch.
Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came to Temple with me. You're a nice family.
I have faith that Chris will grow up to be a real mensch.
Lois, I just figured out how to make sure Chris becomes a big success.
Tell me this has nothing to do with Tony Robbins.
You can't convert someone because you think it'll help their grades.
Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl.
But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!
Why exactly does your son want to join the Jewish faith?
I appreciate your interest, but Judaism takes a serious commitment.
Elliot here has spent years preparing for his Bar Mitzvah this Saturday.
A Bar Mitzvah! Perfect! How much for one of those?
You can't just buy a Bar Mitzvah. It requires a lot of study.
Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?
Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah. I'm OK just the way I...
Now, we got no time to lose. There's gotta be some place in America where you can take a spiritual ceremony that begins a lifetime commitment and blow through it in about 20 minutes.
How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere there's a portrait of you getting prettier.
Wow, someone needs a nap. After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.
This isn't the first time my wit has gone unappreciated.
And in the comedy competition, Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars.
You-you are a very funny man. Men be acting all like zombies at the mall.
Where's your father and Chris? It's not like them to be late for lunch.
Quick, I need to borrow your car. I've got a Bar Mitzvah to stop.
Aw, Chris. In a few minutes you'll become a smart, successful Jewish man.
I could make a foreskin joke but this is a solemn occasion.
Besides, there'll be plenty of time for that on the ride back.
Oh, I got so many of 'em, too. I know, I know. Shh.  But later...
Nothin' I hate worse than a Jew who doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage.
I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.
Then his wife wouldn't be sorry she didn't marry the chimp next door.
Peter, just because Steven makes more money than you doesn't mean he's smarter.
Because I have faith in him, the way I have faith in you.
I see what you're saying. The Jewish are just like us. No better, no worse.
I think what he's trying to say is everything's gonna be OK.
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us

I see what you're saying. The Jewish are just like us. No better, no worse.
I think what he's trying to say is everything's gonna be OK.
Unfortunately, Lois, there's just no more room on the schedule.
We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room for terrific shows... like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared...
Cedric the Entertainer, The Tick, Louie, and Greg the Bunny.
Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes, we might have a shot.
I tell you, Brian, I can't believe that this guy's just lying there taking it.
If it was me, I would have done something about it.
I just bought us some new sheets at Bed Bath and Beyond.
Boy, I hope you stayed away from that Beyond section.
Honey, what do you say we christen these new sheets?
Our sex is so dull for you that you got to fantasize about George Clooney?
I guess that things have become a little stale for me.
I mean, I don't really know that much about any kinky stuff.
I mean, I could hook this car battery up to my nipples.
I don't know. I just don't feel that spark anymore.
Brian is in charge while your father and I are out at Cape Cod.
I'll take good care of them, Lois. You guys have a good time.
Brian, if I choose to make stool in my pants right now... you're the only one here to change me.
Brian, Chris just picked his nose and he keeps touching me with his finger!
What good is mining nose gold if I can't share it with the townspeople?
I swear to God, these kids are gonna make me put a bullet through my head.
If I was in charge, we wouldn't be having this problem.
I'll tell you. Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange.
How does it smell, dog? Does it smell like servitude?
About two hours from Cape Cod's most luxurious bed and breakfast.
I'm so excited I want to prep my diaphragm now.
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? I fall asleep for 10 minutes... and you plow the car into a tree?
Oh, my God! You got to pay attention to the road. We could have been killed!
I knew I should have driven. I should always drive.
Come on, Lois. They said they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow.
That show only furthers the stereotype that George Lopez is funny.
Look, you kids are obviously in need of some type of activity.
I don't know. What do you say we read a book or something?
Two Garfield books and the novelization of the movie Caddyshack. Mananananana, said Ty, sinking yet another ball. Mananananana... Hang on.
Now, as you can see in this panel, Garfield doesn't care for Nermal.
But like him or not, Nermal is here to stay.
Peter and Lois were supposed to chaperone Chris' school dance... tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.
You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this parenting thing.
Besides, I know how to deal with children, unlike Mr. Geppetto.
By the way, Pinocchio, there was a cookie missing from the jar.
Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said you didn't.
No, I took it, Papa. I wouldn't lie to you.
You could try. Who knows? You might get away with it.
That was all the money we had for this trip.
Look, Peter, this second honeymoon was a nice thought... but maybe we should just go home.
Coming up, handsome mustachioed man recaps news in pleasing baritone.
But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is on hand for the opening... of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel.
Diane, I am standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel... because they don't allow Asians inside.
Such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson, who has his own room... on permanent reserve. A room which he barely uses.
Much better than that time I experimented with gene splicing.
How I envy them, dog. They've got their whole lives ahead of them.
Man, look at that kid. That is one ugly eighth grader.
He's absolutely right, kids. Because when you drink, nobody wins.
In fact, last year alone, there were over 27,000 deaths from... chronic liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse.
Excuse me, I'm Mel Gibson, here for the key to my specially reserved room.
Yes, I've put on a few pounds for my next role.
I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior who defied the English to free England...
Yeah, and look at this. They even got some of that high-class British porn.
We are going to have a talk with Jake's parents tomorrow after my burping.
If your teachers ask about your bruises, what do you tell them?
But you can't force the spark back into our marriage.
Well, then I guess this whole second honeymoon was a waste of time.
You know, Margaret, we could have sexual intercourse right now.
Do you think we were too hard on Chris tonight?
No, I just always feel badly when we have to be strict.
I guess I'm going through a phase right now... where I'm only attracted to handsome men.
Just admit that there's no excitement left in our marriage?
Go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other... across the breakfast table, talking about how much we both like Total?
And it's healthy for us, too. Oh, God! It's starting already!
For the son of God, you sure are a son of a...
Caviziel? Is that it? The guy from the first one?
This July, let he who is without sin... kick the first ass.
Man, that's all we need. More Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo.
Well, not if I have anything to say about it!
I am going to make sure this never sees the light of day.
Stealing Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes, and Nazi paraphernalia... is one thing, but this is a multi-million-dollar film.
We gotta get rid of this thing for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy... and all the other beloved children's characters.
Seems he left something very valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it.
Man, this is even more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down.
Don't worry, Lois. I think I know how to lose them.
Okay, now, be polite. And for God's sake... don't mention anything about his kid's face.
I hope we don't wind up on the evening news 'cause of this.
Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems your son Jake had some vodka... at the school dance and Chris got blamed for it.
This whole situation has just turned his whole life upside-down face.
It's no concern of mine if it's turned his life upside-down face.
Fine! If you're gonna be that way about it, maybe I'll do this.
There's got to be a way to get back at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.
Well, Mel Gibson, this is one piece of crap... the world will never have to suffer through.
That's why they picked me to convince Congress to go to war.
There is no just cause for an invasion of Iraq.
Well, that may be. But what we're all forgetting is... anyone who doesn't want to go to war is gay.
I was the first one who wanted to go to war.
Don't take this personally, Mrs. Griffin. I'm doing this because I have to.
As soon as your husband gives me what I want, you're free to go.
But by the time he finds out, we'll be long...
You know, I know this is the wrong time to be star struck... but Mel Gibson is shooting at us.
Honey, I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now.
So I guess this honeymoon was just the kind of excitement... our marriage needed.
Hey, Jefferson, check it out. A chick getting nailed on my head.
In local news, a Buddy Cianci Junior High School student... has been arrested for possession of drugs.
The student has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service... and is a very bad boy.
We now go to Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast. Ollie?
Unfortunately, lois, there's just no more room on the schedule.
We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room for terrific shows...
Cedric the Entertainer, The Tick, louie, and Greg the Bunny,
Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes, we might have a shot.
Lucky there's a family guy lucky there's a man who Positively can do
I tell you, Brian, I can't belleve that this guy's just lying there taking it.
If it was me, I would have done something about it.
I just bought us some new sheets at Bed Bath and Beyond.
Boy, I hope you stayed away from that Beyond section.
Honey, what do you say we christen these new sheets?
Our sex is so dull for you that you got to fantasize about George Clooney?
I guess that things have become a little stale for me.
I mean, I don't really know that much about any kinky stuff.
I mean, I could hook this car battery up to my nipples.
I don't know. I just don't feeI that spark anymore.
Brian is in charge while your father and I are out at Cape Cod.
I'll take good care of them, lois. You guys have a good time.
Brian, if I choose to make stooI in my pants right now... you're the only one here to change me.
Brian, Chris just picked his nose and he keeps touching me with his finger!
What good is mining nose gold if I can't share it with the townspeople?
I swear to God, these kids are gonna make me put a bullet through my head.
If I was in charge, we wouldn't be having this problem.
I'll tell you. Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange.
How does it smell, dog? Does it smell like servitude?
About two hours from Cape Cod's most luxurious bed and breakfast.
I'm so excited I want to prep my diaphragm now.
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? I fall asleep for 10 minutes... and you plow the car into a tree?
Oh, my God! You got to pay attention to the road. We could have been killed!
I knew I should have driven. I should always drive.
Come on, lois. They said they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow.
That show only furthers the stereotype that George lopez is funny.
Hey! Knock it off! look, you kids are obviously in need of some type of activity.
I don't know. What do you say we read a book or something?
Two Garfield books and the novellzation of the movie Caddyshack, Mananananana, said Ty, sinking yet another ball. Mananananana- Hang on.
Now, as you can see in this paneI, Garfield doesn't care for NermaI.
But like him or not, NermaI is here to stay.
Peter and lois were supposed to chaperone Chris' schooI dance... tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.
You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this parenting thing.
Besides, I know how to deaI with children, unlike Mr. Geppetto.
By the way, Pinocchio, there was a cookie missing from the jar.
Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said you didn't.
No, I took it, Papa. I wouldn't lie to you.
You could try. Who knows? You might get away with it.
That was all the money we had for this trip. look, Peter, this second honeymoon was a nice thought... but maybe we should just go home.
Coming up, handsome mustachioed man recaps news in pleasing baritone,
But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is on hand for the opening... of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel,
Diane, I am standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel... because they don't allow Asians inside,
Such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson, who has his own room... on permanent reserve, A room which he barely uses,
Much better than that time I experimented with gene splicing. lois, quick question. Do we have any TylenoI?
How I envy them, dog. They've got their whole lives ahead of them.
Man, look at that kid. That is one ugly eighth grader.
He's absolutely right, kids. Because when you drink, nobody wins.
In fact, last year alone, there were over 27,000 deaths from... chronic liver disease as a result of alcohoI abuse.
Excuse me, I'm MeI Gibson, here for the key to my specially reserved room.
Yes, I've put on a few pounds for my next role.
I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior who defied the English to free England...
Holy mackereI! let me show you to your room, Mr. Gibson!
Yeah, and look at this. They even got some of that high-class British porn.
We are going to have a talk with Jake's parents tomorrow after my burping.
If your teachers ask about your bruises, what do you tell them?
But you can't force the spark back into our marriage.
Well, then I guess this whole second honeymoon was a waste of time.
You know, Margaret, we could have sexual intercourse right now,
Do you think we were too hard on Chris tonight?
No, I just always feeI badly when we have to be strict.
I guess I'm going through a phase right now... where I'm only attracted to handsome men.
Just admit that there's no excitement left in our marriage?
Go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other... across the breakfast table, talking about how much we both like TotaI?
And it's healthy for us, too. Oh, God! It's starting already! lois, we are screwed.
For the son of God, you sure are a son of a-
Caviziel? Is that it? The guy from the first one?
This July, let he who is without sin... kick the first ass,
Man, that's all we need. More MeI Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo.
Well, not if I have anything to say about it!
I am going to make sure this never sees the light of day.
Steallng MeI Gibson's towels, bathrobes, and Nazi paraphernalla... is one thing, but this is a multi-million-dollar fllm.
We gotta get rid of this thing for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy... and all the other beloved chlldren's characters. let's go!
Seems he left something very valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it.
Man, this is even more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down.
Don't worry, lois. I think I know how to lose them.
Okay, now, be polite. And for God's sake... don't mention anything about his kid's face.
I hope we don't wind up on the evening news 'cause of this.
Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems your son Jake had some vodka... at the schooI dance and Chris got blamed for it.
This whole situation has just turned his whole life upside-down face.
It's no concern of mine if it's turned his life upside-down face.

But by the time he finds out, we'll be long-
You know, I know this is the wrong time to be star struck... but MeI Gibson is shooting at us.
Oh, man. I'm coming, lois. lois, look. I'm a booger.
Honey, I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now.
So I guess this honeymoon was just the kind of excitement... our marriage needed.
Hey, Jefferson, check it out. A chick getting nalled on my head.
In local news, a Buddy Cianci Junior High School student... has been arrested for possession of drugs,
The student has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service... and is a very bad boy,
We now go to Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast, Ollie?
NARRATOR: In the television comedy world, the people are entertained... by two separate yet equally important types of shows.
Traditional sitcoms that get laughs out of everyday situations... like trying to fix your own plumbing or inviting two dates to the same dance.
And animated shows that make jokes about farting. This is the latter.
You kids are the most important thing in our lives.
Don't worry about Meg. She's got everything she needs in her room.
Most of the time, the kids'll exercise out in the field.
But if it's raining or I'm hung-over, they stay inside and play dodge ball.
And this week in Home Ec, we're teaching your kids... how to make bundt cake.
The school band offers a wide variety of instruments... from the kettledrum to the trombone.
I know, isn't he wonderful? He took lessons in junior college.
I like meeting Chris's teachers. This ought to be more interesting than... that time I met Ted Danson.
Sometimes it's good to be a freak. Do you want to sleep together later?
Good evening, parents. I'm Ms. Clifton. I'd like for you to fill out these... contact information sheets. Now, who would like to pass them out?
Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!
I'm sorry. Will you all please excuse me for a moment?
I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone. Who's gonna teach my class now?
You're very knowledgeable, the kids might knock you down a few pegs... which would be good for you.
You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois. I probably have a lot to offer young people.
How to lick the Dorito crumbs from between the sofa cushions?
Or how to leave a dead bird on the carpet?
I thought your father's name was Cocoa, and he was hit by a milk truck!
All right. Our goal here is to gain a command of the English language.
So you can be successful writers like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
You think we could put both our names on that?
What? You've done nothing but eat Breyer's and smoke pot... for the last six months.
Yeah, Chris. What's it like to have Brian as a teacher?
It sucks! Mr. Griffin gave me an F on my first assignment!
What? An F, Brian? After all Chris has done for you?
If dogs aren't supposed to eat dental floss out of the garbage... why do they make it mint-flavored?
Chris, when I was in school, you know what we used to do... when a teacher gave us a bad grade?
[In Southern accent] Hello, class. Mark Twain here, filling in for Brian Griffin.
I understand you children read my book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
Now, who can tell me... Bobby, stop screwing around back there!
Who can tell me the significance of the carpetbaggers in my novel?
That's exactly right. Just like the presidency of James Garfield.
You kids are mighty smart. You must have a powerful good teacher.
Well, I gotta catch my time steamboat back to the 1800s.
Well, I hope the rest of you kids learned something today.
Reassigned? Can I at least come down to your office and talk to you about this?
Brian, check it out. I made a water slide in the house.
I'm not gonna call the hospital because you won't learn anything if I do.
I graded your quizzes from yesterday. Most of you did well.
Some of you, I think, can do better. What do you see here, Chris?
Hi. I'm Mr. Griffin. But you can call me Brian.
All right. How about we go around the room and everyone can say... a little something about themselves?
My name is Carlos. And beneath my tough exterior is a boy aching to learn.
Can I have this one? My mom keeps giving mine away.
Dad, I need some advice. I need to know how to get a girl to like me.
You just got to do something simple, like Vincent van Gogh.
No, I like it. But it's just... Why your ear?
Well, at least this will be a funny story to tell our kids someday.
I wish you'd told me that before I got you this.
Did I hear my big boy say he's got a crush on some lucky girl?
You know, Chris, I knew this day would come. So, I brought you a condom.
WOMAN: Now, where were we? MAN: This is much better.
Chris, honey, the way to win a girl is to do something romantic and unexpected.
On my 25th birthday, your father surprised me by showing up... in nothing but a space helmet and moon boots.
Just remember, fat man, those jugs are mine until the milk dries up.
So, basically, what Orwell was saying was, It's not perfect but I'll take it.
People have gotten into a lot of trouble that way.
Peter, are you listening? Chris has a crush on his teacher.
God! Just listen to this kid's report on Great Expectations. Miss Havisham should have throwed that cake out so it don't like... mess all up the bitch's house.
I don't know what to do, you know? Society's given up on these kids.
I feel like I may be the only one who can help them.
I think your problem is you're not communicating in a way... that speaks to their experience.
Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe I should just try... a whole new approach. Thanks.
Let's see the kid with the hearing aid from Barney do this.
All right. So's I'm chilling in Verona when my homie busts out with: Yo, Romeo. Check out that biotch Juliet in the window.
Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like, East Coast rappers... and my posse's representing West Side.
Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie. Know what I'm saying?
We wanted to talk to you about our son. You see, Chris really...
Lois, honey, let's make sure we do this delicately, all right?
Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob. I mean a melon.
I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts barely covered by a racing t-shirt.
Mrs. Lockhart, we just wanted you to know... so you could spare his feelings and let him down gently.
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say to Chris.
Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose, but do you have a picture of yourself... that I could tape to the back of Lois's head?
'Cause I couldn't stand to be away from you for another moment.
Make a flip book of a stick figure whose head gets bigger and bigger... and bigger and then pops?
If we're going to be together, I need you to kill my husband.
Chris, you big beautiful man, I'm so glad you came.
Up the stairs, second door on the left. He should still be asleep.
Maybe you could just get a divorce, and we could live together... in the fort under my bed.
Okay. But I got to give you the password, or you can't get into the fort.
It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. Don't put that in with my things!
You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't usually read things out of Chris's pockets.
Can we stop at the supermarket? I want a Granny Smith apple.
Yeah, I know. I'm late. Okay, let's just get started.
That's an ampersand. It's a symbol for the word and.
My God, nobody can be this stupid. Not even Peter when he took... that blow to the head and thought he was Larry from Three's Company.
Jack, there's a hot tub party across the street and we're invited.
And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by, I'll make sure he thinks you're...
There is nothing I would like to do more than chillax, Amanda.
But without a decent education, you could spend the rest of your life... as a ditch digger or a motel maid or a hooker.
Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher that ever told us we could do anything.
Well, I didn't mean sell your body for money. O, Captain! my Captain!
Well, if it works for you, I guess... O, Captain! my Captain!
What the hell? Be the best damn hooker you can be. O, Captain! my Captain!
I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
I have to get rid of this body, or Chris'll go to prison!
And we all know what happens in those prison showers. I've seen Oz.
A man can wash another man in the merry old land of Oz
All right, wait here, Stewie, while Mommy gets the cement blocks.
Good middle-management type. Just blends in with the furniture there.
Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem. Well, take it easy.
Yes. You, too. And if you see Arnie, tell him:
You know what I hate? A guy in a blue suit.
You know, Lois, Chris is cool and everything, but since he killed that guy...
I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be living with us here now.
Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll have plenty of time to escape... while he's killing Meg. He hates her the most.
Chris, why don't you take your sister into the kitchen for a sandwich?
What I did? That I lied about my age to get into Indian Bingo?
Premeditated murder is one thing, but I will not have lying in this house.
Wait, hold it. Can we finish this after Joan of Arcadia?
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a breaking news story.
We apologize to Joan of Arcadia's sanctimonious, fear-based... and probably overweight viewers.
That's right, Diane. It appears Ronald Lockhart... has been brutally murdered by his wife, Lana, and a local bear.
Well, I'll be damned. Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.
That's okay. I just wonder what happened to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.
I thought we'd try that lobster place we passed in the car.

Well, I'll be damned. Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.
That's okay. I just wonder what happened to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.
I thought we'd try that lobster place we passed in the car.
I must say I do feel a strange satisfaction... watching the black ball topple all those self-righteous white pins.
If the black ball's innocent, it has nothing to fear.
Hey, you're just in time. Mort's one ball away from a perfect game.
Why didn't I clothespin the end of my penis like Muriel told me to?
Hey, you want to see what I can do? All right, ready? Check it out.
Oh, hey. Guess I'll go over here for a minute.
I've never seen anyone do that. You want to go out later?
QUAGMIRE: Would you just sit down and go to the bathroom already?
A scandal at the Quahog Bowling Alley tonight... where a local man, Glenn Quagmire... was charged with peeping in the ladies'room.
You're lucky I've got some extra pull around here... thanks to my 18 medals for heroism.
Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much, why don't you marry them?
And in the event of your death... you'd like the insurance policy to be paid to your wife?
You know what? You can probably go ahead and cancel that.
All right, all right, look, I know an apology is due here... so, Lois, tell Quagmire you're sorry you had him arrested.
Excuse me? He's the one who owes me an apology.
Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive, Lois. It's a positive thing.
We're petitioning the city to have him removed from the neighborhood.
Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby into the world with him running around.
First of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant for six years, all right?
Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy. He's just a little mixed up.
Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy, you know? He's just a little mixed up.
All right. But one more incident like the one at the bowling alley... and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.
I don't know, Peter. I'm not sure I can do this.
All right, Glenn. This exercise should help teach you self-control.
Peter, are you sure Quagmire is ready to be out in public?
I got the idea from when Brian had to wear that cone after his operation.
Okay, if I make this, we're all gonna get laid.
BRIAN: Boy, I'd really like to chew on my crotch right now.
We don't want to get our sweaters all wet. Better take them off.
This is where we monitor all the dressing rooms in the mall... so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.
It's just that all you guys have something to be proud of.
PETER: Quagmire got a key to the city. Mort bowled a perfect game.
I have 125. Do I hear 130? $130,000 for this authentic Comanche headdress?
I got 130. Do I hear 135? 140? Do I hear...
I'm the only one here who's got nothing, you know?
If I die tomorrow, there's nothing people would remember me for.
Not if you jumped off a skyscraper and landed on Joan Cusack.
People would say, Hey, remember that guy who landed on Joan Cusack?
From this day forth, people are gonna know the name Peter Griffin... even if I have to shout it from the rooftops.
I am gonna do something that people will remember me for.
Peter, if you'd just let me talk, I'll explain to you why you shouldn't do this.
Later, Brian. I gotta do something people will remember me for... which is why I've invented a new type of flying machine.
You know, I vaguely recall seeing footage somewhere... of something exactly like this that leads me to believe this probably won't work.
All right... we attack the Rice Krispie guys at dawn, assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.
Brian, this time, I think I got just the thing people will remember me for.
I am gonna stop pollution with my new lovable character...
Pick up your trash! I want to know whose cup this is.
I said I want to know whose cup this is!
See what a nicer place this is when we all pitch in?
Like Gary the No-Trash Cougar says: Give a larbage, throw out your garbage.
Those freaking elves, man. They just came out of the trees, man.
I've been working on this all week and I keep coming up dry.
Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna be remembered for anything.
Not like my great-great-uncles, the Siamese twins... who fought each other in the Civil War.
Peter, you have to stop comparing yourself to other people... and find out what's special about you.
In sadder news, the man who held the Guinness World Record... for most drugs ever done by a single human being died today.
He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs he thought he saw.
There you go, Peter. You could break a world record.
Everybody, you're looking at a guy who's gonna set a new world record.
I am gonna eat more nickels than anyone has ever eaten before.
Setting this world record is gonna make me famous... just like the world's fattest twins over there.
This is the worst use of money since I tricked out my big wheel.
LOIS: I love you, too, Peter. Even if you are full of nickels.
My cousin Marshall insists if you look past the picture... you can see a spaceship.
Can you please just tell us what's wrong with my husband?
Oh, yes. You see, after ingesting such a large number of metal coins...
Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed to nickel poisoning... causing him to lose his sight.
Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat. I can't see a damn thing.
You know what else you can't see? The writing on the wall.
Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box they're gonna bury it in.
Back then, everybody had a specialty. I, for one, am a tumbler.
So we're all gonna have to pitch in and help your father out... now that he's lost his sight.
Nobody took care of me when I lost my arms and legs... and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb.
Hey, Meg, they got a Happy Days spoof in here... but they call it Crappy Days.
If you're not gonna laugh, then I'm not gonna keep you company.
This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's gonna remember me for after I die... is being that blind guy.
I don't know, Brian. I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.
Oh, my God, I almost didn't do it. I almost didn't do it.
I went for it and I am so glad I did.
Now feel my warm breath on the nape of your neck.
My hands on your big soft boobs running down your big manlike...
Well, because I can't do anything for myself, Brian. I can't drive.
And I took a dump in the church confessional... which I guess they frown upon if you're not homeless.
I thought I could deal with being blind at first.
I haven't felt this out of place since that week I lived with Superman.
We must stop Lex Luthor before he irradiates the world's supply of gold.
Hi, sorry. I know you got a meeting going on. But...
So we are officially running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its.
If you're heading to the store later... you know, 800-mile drive for me, like, five seconds for you.
I've been looking into support groups we could join to help him.
You know, since Peter went blind... it's actually been kind of nice not to have to worry about my appearance.
I was kind of thinking I'd try an au naturel thing.
All right, you don't want to come in? Fine. I'll just tie you to this parking meter.
Lois had it on the other night and I was kind of fading in and out.
But, you know, I was watching and I'm wondering, which one is the funny guy?
Tell us, sir, how did you summon the courage to save your friend...
And there you have it. Coming up next, watch me shave.
I am so proud of you for saving Horace's life.
You know, Brian, I guess I was. And you know what else?
And he plays by no one's rules but his own.
I mean, you're the only one of us who's ever had a real boyfriend.
You're such a good listener. You're not like the other boys.
I guess I could give it a try. All right, here goes.
That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own... which I would never do.
Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school... make you feel bad about yourself. I tell you what.
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out and get you some brand new outfits.
Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
What the hell's it look like? I'm putting the bar up for sale.
Please tell me this is some kind of practical joke.
Like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
I'm afraid I have some very bad news. Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.
You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.
Ever since that mega-mall opened across the street... it's been taking away all my business.
[Effeminately] I go to Baskin-Robbins every night and buy myself a little treat.
Now, how in the hell am I supposed to compete with that?
PETER: Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up.
Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping?
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height.
Well, they've got one that says Porn Star... and another that says Sperm Dumpster and they're all written in glitter.
Face it, Mom. No matter what I wear, I look ugly.
Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave.
But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall... where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa... is handing out makeovers.
Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed... by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
My daughter needs a makeover like there's no freaking tomorrow.
Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of and everything's failed.
It's a karaoke machine. I never got around to installing it.
Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing.
Wait a minute. You're supposed to be on the moon.
Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry. It was 20 years ago.
Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautiful just the way you...
Welcome to the family, sweetheart. Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures.
[Singing The Morning After] There's got to be a morning after
Well, we just need to kick it up a notch.
Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band.
You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots... at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.
Brian, you're just ants at a picnic. We're gonna be awesome.
I'm ants at a picnic? Is that what you just said?
I'm ants at a picnic? All right. Just making sure.
Well, I figured it'd be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis.
You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched.
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear... as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue.
LOIS: Oh, my. Hi, Gene. I didn't know you were here.
Now that you're attractive, how about we go out sometime?
Great, I'll pick you up whenever I feel like it.
Hey, Meg. We noticed Craig Hoffman just asked you out.
Like when the Tin Man found out he was gay.
I hear there's a lot of buzz about this band.
Yeah, there was a pretty positive review carved in Tony's ass.
It's very important to your father... that we're here for his band's first performance.
The people who beat you are proud to present, all the way from Quahog...
I know what I'm doing. I'm getting out of here.
Boy, that's not healthy, is it? That that's the first place I go to?
[Singing] Cloudy skies and rain clouds Have come to stay
And I'd like to make you filthy rich rock stars.
I get that from my father. He's from a different generation.
Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud... can you perform surgery on yourself?
I got three choices for you for the name of the band:
Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers... or Testicular Sound Express.
We got to get her half-naked and put her out front, center stage.
And that's gonna make y'all billionaires... because America loves hot, white jailbait ass.
That's the smartest thing I've ever heard... anyone say about anything.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way.
Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision. I want to be exploited.
Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie... but business is business. So, let's get this show on the road, huh?
You guys know I have no problem with black people, right?
Stewie and I have been working on some stuff of our own.
And we thought there might be a place for us to sing on the next album.
He said he'd think about it. Okay, so where were we?
You know, ever since you got that makeover... you've developed a terrible attitude.
And all the success with the family band is only making it worse.
You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but I am the band.
Peter, we have to do something. We're losing our daughter.
Lois, this is the kind of thing... that always resolves itself if you just ignore it, all right?
This is even more fun than when I performed at the White House.
Meg, you and your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live.
You mean I'm gonna get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner... and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley, and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!
Why don't you come hang out in my dressing room?
Peter, I'm worried about Meg. She's spiraling out of control.
That was everything Ladies Home Journal said it would be.
Being with you just made me feel so... Live from New York... it's Saturday Night!
Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it?
Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered... in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TVaudience?
All right, stand aside. It's about time I did my fatherly duty.
I said duty, but no time to laugh about it now.
And this is for laughing and looking at the camera... during every sketch you've ever been in.
You think because she did it, it's okay for you?
All right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter?
Not for me, but it's good to have you back, pumpkin.
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
I want to thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport.
Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris, the guys from the prison...
TV HOST: From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem... it's show time at the...
Peter, thanks a lot for having us out on your boat.
Peter, are you sure Santos and Pasqual... don't mind coming in on a Saturday to serve us drinks?
Work is their cocaine. Besides, look at them in their tuxedos.
I was thinking, you know, if you ever want to...
So, you know, it's just something to mull around in the old noggin.
Damn. What is it about golf that always brings out the worst in me?
So, Annika Sorenstam, you're quite the female golfer, aren't you?
Sorry about that, Loretta. Hey, can I have my fish back?
Yeah, you go in and get that. Show that fishy who's boss.
Loretta, they have some of that three-bean salad you're so fond of.
Lois, why the hell do we have to take a stupid CPR class?
Because, Peter, none of us knew what to do when Joe was drowning.
Hi, there. I'd like to welcome you all to CPR.
I see a lot of smiles here in this room.
I see that soda up under your chair. That's all right.
Soda's all right on my watch. We also got Oreos here and fresh coffee.
No, I don't volunteer for anything since I helped those guys... repaint the Sistine Chapel.
Listen, I thought the stuff that was there was kind of lame. So I put this up.
I figured Andre the Giant would be a little hipper.
But, you know, that stuff about spending the day together tomorrow...
So drop me a line. And then I'll have yours.
Only a couple of Oreos gone. I'm gonna take the rest home to the cats.
Sorry, I was dialing the phone. Are you all right?
I'll get to you in a moment, sir. I'm gonna have to check... and see if he soiled himself.
Sir? I'm gonna need you to stop struggling, all right?
I'm gonna need you to step back. All right, Looks like we're clean down here.
You guys take it easy. No need to thank me. Just pay it forward.
This is worse than when they took away my library card... for reading while intoxicated.
Sir, do you know how loud you were reading? The life of a silversmith's apprentice was not an easy one!
I got to figure out some way to get that card back.
What is it, boy? What are you trying to say?
You know, for a large, heavyset... black guy, Cleveland's got a cute, little white ass.
Shut up and put some more... of that sugar in my bowl.
Wait a minute. Brian? If that wasn't Cleveland doing it with Loretta... then Loretta's having an affair.
That is the last thing in the world we want to do.
So I guess the only thing left to do... is tell you that Loretta Brown is having an affair.
This is worse than that time I had to fess up to the nation.
My fellow Americans, I have not been entirely truthful with you.
All we know is it's a skinny white guy... with a tattoo on his left butt cheek.
Well, I better tell Cleveland. I got a knack for delivering bad news.
I don't know how to tell you this, Mr. DeVanney.
I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS You've got the AIDS
You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here
It isn't clear But what we're certain of is you have AIDS
In Superman II, what is the story with that cellophane S... that Superman rips off his chest and throws at the bad guy?
Brian and I walked into your house and she was with some guy going...
I'm a woman, Cleveland. I need some passion in my life.
I need a real man. And Lord knows that ain't you.
Well, I admit after a long day at work, I don't always come home... with that Riunite on ice, that's nice mentality.
Apologize? I cheat on you and you apologize to me?
Cleveland, I am so sorry. You can stay here as long as you like.
I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles.
Now, everybody, Cleveland's gonna be staying with us for a few days.
That's right, kids. So just treat him like one of the family.
You mean like Cousin Janine who we're polite to but then mock her diabetes... on the drive home?
His wife cheated on him, kicked him out of the house... and he doesn't seem at all affected by it.
He's probably bottling up his emotions. That's not good for you.
Right. I almost got an ulcer after you shelled out $200... for tickets to Crossing Over with John Edward.
I'm sensing an A. Does your name begin with an A?
C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P?
What Cleveland really needs right now is to learn how to express his feelings.
Now, what he needs right now is a revenge lay.
Well, I think we're about to find out who the culprit is.
I didn't mean it, you know? I knew it was a mistake!
I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now.
It's okay? It's okay to be betrayed by your wife and best friend?
Better it be Quagmire than someone she could get a disease from.
Cleveland, don't you see? This is why your wife left you.
Sometimes a woman wants to see her man be a man.
You got to get a little rough! Oh, God! Peter, hit me!
Now, the first thing we're gonna do... is take you to a good, old-fashioned, wrestling match.
All right, Cleveland. Nothing like a good smackdown... to get the testosterone going.
I must be in Quahog 'cause all I see is a bunch of hicks!
But don't you want to hit the guy sitting next to you?
All right, Cleveland. If this doesn't light a fire in your belly, nothing will.
Hey, look at me. I'm Quagmire. I had sex with your wife.
What the hell are you doing? What is that in your pocket?
Okay, Cleveland, breathe into the bag. It'll calm you down.
There's no time. I got to go warn Quagmire while I got the chance.
Cleveland will never think to look for you at Mayor West's house.
It is my job. I only ask that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie... as he's already eaten and might throw up.
Well, Derwood, now you really are the big man of the house.
You know, Endora, I'm getting a little sick of this crap.
You ever seen one of these? Huh? You know what this is? Huh?
It's all right to go to sleep, my friend. I'll stand guard.
Don't worry. I'll be here all night. Just don't try to make me smile.
That episode of Growing Pains when Mike's friend Boner... ran for student council.
And I know just how to do it. To the Hinden-Peter!
JOE: Oh, my God! PETER: Joe, I am so sorry.
Why don't you come on over and we can... try to get things back to the way they used to be?
[In pseudo-Czech accent] Perhaps here there are many unsuspecting foxes... to have sex with us.
[In pseudo-Czech accent] That is why we wear tight pants to show our bulges.
Cleveland, I think this beautiful woman would like to say something to you.
Well, I may not be perfect, but I deserve better than you.
It's a chance for a fresh start for both Cleveland and...
Glenn, you sure you want to do this? I already told you I forgive you.
Yeah, this will be a lot more fun than last Saturday... when we went to see The Vagina Monologues.
So, in international news, no luck yet finding Osama bin Laden.
So the government is trying a new tactic. They've hired Jeff Gillooly.
Sorry, I guess that joke was not so fresh, but you know...
Thanks for including my civil rights board game... in the game night rotation, guys.
For whistling at a white woman, go directly to jail.
You don't win. You just do a little better each time.
Well, we could use these. I brought them from the office.
Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns at each other in the house?
All right, all right, nobody fire at Lois. She's scared.
You're doing better than Peter Weller from the opening scene of RoboCop.
Well, now that the mess is cleaned up and we're back from the emergency room... it's time for the last game of the night, Trivial Pursuit.
Man, I hate Trivial Pursuit. Always makes me feel so stupid.
More stupid than that time you locked your keys out of the car?
All right, Brian, this one's for you. What naturally occurring element has the highest melting point of all metals?
Okay, here we go. What color is a fire truck?
Fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, what color are those red fire trucks?
Oh, God, I can picture them now, all red and everything.
Good thing I just watched that National Geographic special on fire trucks.
NARRATOR: A solitary killer, the fire truck stalks its prey.
The fire truck can consume eight times its body weight.
Okay, Brian, Name the 16th century ecumenical body... that marked a major turning point for Christianity in Europe.
Okay, Peter, this is for the win. Say the word 'what.'
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, now, Lois. This is not a race.
Fantastic Four, steak, steak, steak, steak, a small amount of peas.
This is even better than that time I met Timer the Cheese Guy.
[Singing] I hanker for a hunk of A slab or slice or chunk of
It is 3:30 in the morning. I am very tired.
Peter, you do know that all your questions were incredibly easy.
You ever stop and think, Wow, I'm married to that guy?
The administration's plan for peace in the Middle East is shallow and pedantic.
Well, Lois, since you asked, I find this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic.
What is this, you're gonna talk down to everyone... just because you won a game of Trivial Pursuit?
Okay, you know what? Fine, you are a genius, Peter.
Well, if you qualify as a genius... the Foundation will give you a $500,000 grant... just to sit around and do whatever you want.
Wow! Imagine what a genius like me could do with all that money.
Well, here they are, Brian. My test results. Read them and weep.
Oh, yeah? Well, would a mentally retarded guy... have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house... in celebration of his fantastic test results?
So, as you can see, you are just over the line of mental retardation.
That's right, senior prom. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.
And I'm just calling to let you know... you might want to get yourself tested.
It isn't something you can catch. Don't you think you're overreacting?
You know, Peter, I hate to say I told you so about not being a genius, but... yeah! In your... face,!
I can't believe this is happening to me. I can never go back to school again.
Yes, this is the thing that will ruin your reputation.
Not your years of grotesque appearance or awkward social graces... or that Felix Unger-ish way you clear your sinuses.
Do you hear yourself talk? I might kill you tonight.
No piece of paper from the city is gonna tell me... you're any different from the man I married.
Why are they trying to publicly humiliate me like this?
Well, Joe, I need to talk to you about something kind of personal.
Well, you know, I took this test... and it sort of turns out that I'm technically mentally retarded.
And, you know, I just wanted to ask... you know, how do you deal with it?
Can he still drive a car? Can he drink at a bar?
Will they let him have kids? Is his life on the skids?
I kind of get the helmet. But what's with the water wings?
Now, there are plenty of people who have had worse days.
I wish I could just close my eyes and make all this go away.
Do I look like I'm all right? My back is broken and my leg is twisted!
Wait a minute. You mean you're not even gonna call the cops?
Oh, my God. I could get away with anything. And on the sixth day, God said: 'Let the Earth bring forth the living creatures and...'
Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago? I'm retarded.
Well, let me show you how everything works down there.
Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself one super family.
I'm here to lend a hand to my main man, Peter.
You are really starting to take advantage of this whole situation.
This man seems bent on diluting the already watered-down significance... of the elevated hand slap.
I look even more foolish than when I was at that cocktail party.
All right, you're gonna love this. So... Hang on a sec.
Okay, so these two black guys walk into a bar, and the bartender looks...
So, the bartender looks around and says: What'll you two fine gentlemen have?
And they paid their tab and couldn't have been more courteous.
All right, my first trip to a fast-food joint as a retarded guy.
Sorry, folks. Oh, my God. Is that what my voice sounds like?
You know what? I'm just gonna get my own food.
Lois, you look worse than that Rocky Dennis kid from Mask.
What is this now? Does your face have a pelvis?
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm the worst husband ever.
Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services. I'm here to take your kids away.
Well, at least Cleveland offered to take care of them.
Sorry you have to share a bed, boys. I'm a little short on space.
She used to be in movies, but she's not in movies anymore.
She's attractive enough... but when she smiles, you see too much gum.
If y'all get hungry, there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.
I'm gonna get me a spoonful now before y'all have at it.
Oh, my God. Craig Hoffman's new car is so cool.
Yeah, I remember his dad dropped him off at school in it... one time when he was a freshman.
They have a mall there that's pretty cool. It's part underground.
Damn it, you guys are boring the crap out of me.
I'm just gonna go back to my place and rent a dirty movie.
Listen, there's no toilet paper in the bathroom... so, I'm just gonna...
The doctors still don't know how much longer she's gonna have to be here.
I put Lois in the hospital, and I lost the kids.
Peter, you just need to show what a good father you are.
And the best way to do that is to show what a terrible father Cleveland is.
And tonight on CBS News... seven Saudi soldiers sodomize... several of Saddam 's southern settlement squatters.
This'll show them that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.
So, tell me, is there any tread left on the tires at all?
Or at this point, would it be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway?
Yeah. Peter, you and five of those prostitutes, get out.
So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin, you've inspired me... to distrust all mentally challenged parents.
And thank you, Agent Jessup, for your comically misleading remarks.
Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say in your defense... as to why this court should return custody of your children to you?
Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand my surprise witness...
But I'm the only one who can see him and hear him... so I'll let everyone know what he's saying and doing.
Ghost That Never Lies... did you witness the events that took place on that fateful day?
And, do you see the culprit or culprits in this courtroom today?
Well, would you kindly point him or them out for this court?
But I only did it so I could get my kids back.
And I think it's a bum rap that just because I'm retarded... that makes me an unfit parent.
There are plenty of unfit parents out there who aren't retarded... but they get to keep their kids.
Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford. I think the Ramseys still got one left.
I just want them back, Your Honor, and you're the only one who can help me.
I would put you in a place where you would be removed from the general public.
Perhaps locked in a big, secure building with other dangerous people... for a pre-determined period of time... based on the nature and degree of your offense.
Unfortunately, as far as I know, no such place exists.
So I have no choice but to set you free.
MAN: [On TV] And now, back to Jake and the Fatman.
Hey, look over here on the carpet. That's a cigarette butt.
Hey, I'm talking about evidence here. There's lipstick on it.
You know what? Forget it. I'll take care of this, okay?
Just yesterday, when we saw her at the country club... she had a cigarette in her hand.
And the doctors say I'll smell like French fries for the next six months.
Now we can live with you again even though you're a dangerous retard.
Don't say retard, Chris. We prefer to be called little people.
Someday, you will beg us for mercy and we will consider it.
Because you can't just sit home every night since Loretta left.
Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make... a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back?
Sorry, I went burnt sienna and I never went back.
Open up, Stewie. The airplane's coming in for a landing.
Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God! Look at the size of that pimple.
The operation was a success. What are you gonna go by now?
You know, Chris, we'll have to do something about that.
I like him. He's my friend. His name is Doug.
I just wish I didn't have to look at it.
The Bachelorette comes to Quahog in search of male contestants.
You know, this could be the perfect way for Cleveland to meet Mrs. Right.
Joe? Sorry, I dialed the wrong number. I meant to call Cleveland.
No, I'd like to talk to you, too. It's just that...
So, why would you be a good candidate on The Bachelorette?
I would be perfect for your show... because I know how to talk dirty to the ladies.
Peter, I can't do this. I am too nervous. I got to go.
Let me out of here! I need to get out of here.
Cleveland, no, you're staying. This is for your own good.
Excuse me. Hi. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for Peter.
You see, his wife left him and he's been kind of Ionely... confused about what he really wants.
Really? You're sure you don't want to reconsider my friend?
Brian, I can't believe you're gonna be on The Bachelorette.
But I figured I got a few days of free booze and food... before they kick me off. I could use a vacation.
Oh, yeah, because you've got such a heavy workload around here.
How you coming on that novel you're working on, huh?
The big novel you've been working on for three years, huh?
Talking about that three years ago. Been working on that the whole time?
At the end your main character is richer for the experience? Yeah?
I got to get on that show. Come on, I'll do anything.
All he does lately is sit alone in his room talking to that zit.
Talk to him and tell him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble?
Now light it, ring the doorbell, and run like hell!
I'm doing the dishes, Joe. I'll change you in a minute.
I wasn't too nervous. When I am nervous I work out.
I wasn't working out, so I must not have been nervous.
And this guy knew his stuff. Made me a Mojito.
Hey, guys. Well, it's been great to meet you all.
And I am looking forward to getting to know you while we're here.
I got to tell you. I don't know what she would possibly see in Count Chocula.
You're not like those other Snorks who only want one thing.
Who gets to stay, and who takes the bus ride home... it's up to Brooke.
Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine?
I feel like I didn't get to know you at all.
But I think this whole thing is about as pointless as Peter's cow-kite.
This is never gonna work. Damn cow. Cleveland, what am I doing wrong?
You got to get her running before you start running.
It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna use the money to get a mammogram.
Doug told me I don't need to listen to you.
First thing tomorrow, we're going down to Goldman's Pharmacy... and get some astringent to get rid of that thing.
What did I tell you? She's trying to drive us apart.
Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch and our first group date.
Oh, come on, you can't expect me to ride that thing.
I had to sneak off. Oh, could I bum one of those?
You know, I don't even know why I agreed to do this show.
I'd much rather just be home listening to my old jazz records.
Really? I didn't know. I actually have quite a jazz collection myself.
You know, I got to say, I thought she was just some actress...
Iooking for her 15 minutes of fame, but she's pretty sharp, you know.
I guess you can't judge a Brooke by her cover.
And maybe you can cut out when I said junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing.
Seems like he's probably the kind of guy who might sue.
I mean, the guy's got to have no money left.
All right, gentlemen... let's see how Glenn's private date with Brooke is going.
Hey, Brooke, what do you say, we get you some more champagne?
Oh, my God, Peter, it looks like there's been a break in.
I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were one of those criminals... who broke in and destroyed my entire stock of acne medication.
Oh, my God. Peter, do you think Chris might have done this?
Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you were younger.
For God's sake, you used to make Plasto molds of celebrity body parts.
This one's going on the shelf right next to Dan Fogelberg.
Just wait in your dressing room. I'll come back for you, Oates.
Really? After I drugged you... and tried to have sex with your unconscious body?
Yeah, I mean, I know I was skeptical at first... but I got to be honest, I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Brooke has narrowed her choice down to Quagmire and Brian.
All that's left is for Brooke to meet their families.
So, did you loose? You got to tell me all about it.
Was she a dumb bimbo like you said but with a big rack.
I bet your stories will make me laugh so hard, I'll shoot milk out of my nose.
I went over this with you a few minutes ago.
Why, it's wonderful to meet you. We've heard so many nice things.
Yes, indeed. So, how long have you been a prostitute?
Peter, we have proof that it was Chris who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy.
I knew it. I didn't want to believe it, but it's true.
And I just might reach into your brain and do this.
Now, grab my bacon grease and slather me up some homeys.
Brian, we've had some wonderful times. I really like you.
I hope you and Quagmire have all the happiness in the world.
Well, it wasn't as bad as the evening I spent with Glenn and his mother.
Don't you talk to Mittens that way. Mittens is a member of this family.
Mom, you want this three-way to happen, you're gonna have to change your tone.
My God, you've just made me the happiest dog in the world.
Well, it was great working with you, Brian. Good luck.
On behalf of ABC, I'd like to give you this parting gift.
Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last message... or any of the other ones. Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...
'cause you might be trying to call me right now.
And I don't want to tie up the line. So, I guess...
Hey, me again. Thought I might've heard a voice when I was hanging up.
Nope? I guess not. Okay, I will talk to you soon.
Anyway, I got a fax earlier about cheap airfare to Cancun.
Didn't know if that was you trying to reach me.
Let me give you my home number again just in case you lost it.
Your voicemail was full, so I got you this answering machine.
Listen, Brian, I want you to leave me alone, or I'm calling the cops.
Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit.
I bet some of those awful kids at school call you zit-face.
She told me she loved me on what used to be a hit TV show.
I can't believe I got sucked into that phony reality world... just like everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking.
I know it hurts now, Brian, but look at the bright side.
You have some new material for that novel you've been writing.
You know, the one you've been working on for three years.
You got something new to write about now, you know.
Maybe a main character gets into a relationship... then suffers a little heartbreak.
Make those second hundred pages... really keep the reader guessing what's going to happen.
Thanks for baby-sitting, Meg. We'll be back in a couple of hours.
I mean, what's he really gonna do if we leave him by himself?
So, this is awkward, but... have we ever actually, you know, met?
I mean, you know, I don't even know, say, for example, if you have a room up there.
You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now... you'll probably get a full page in the yearbook.
Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day, and I always give you the same answer.
God, I don't think I could have been any clearer the last time I turned him down.
Hey, Mort. Lois and I are out on our date night.
And some Excedrin. My wife's got a headache this big.
Jeez, that's more of a rip-off than that breakfast machine I bought.
All it does is shoot you. It doesn't make breakfast at all.
Wait a minute, what the hell's a tab? Does that mean I don't gotta pay?
Hey, while I'm at it, give me all these copies of Marie Claire.
You know, in case I want to rub out that easy one... before I get Lois into bed tonight.
COMMENTATOR: [On TV] And now back to The Kids' Choice Awards... with host Paula Poundstone.
There's a granola bar in the cupboard. I want it.
Oh, my God. Stewie, just shut up and go to bed!
Do you know what I do, Meg? I spit in your mouth while you sleep.
Finally. Look, Mom, I've had it. I am not baby-sitting anymore.
It's Saturday night, I could be out having a life.
Meg, if you don't want to baby-sit anymore, that's fine.
Meg, she torched your ass, man. She torched your ass.
So, a wild guess here... but from the looks of your arm hair, I'm guessing you're Italian?
All right, you guys, I got eight crates of ipecac from Mort, all on my tab.
Now, whoever goes the longest without puking... gets the last piece of pie in the fridge.
You know, I don't know if you guys had any of that pie already... but that is some tasty stuff. That's from the bake sale that Lois...
One down. I know somebody who won't be having any...
Oh, boy! That means I win. I get to eat...
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing. I can't believe this is happening to me.
Looks like someone could use a greeting card to cheer them up.
I put these on my tab. Here, take a Far Side one.
Hey, Peter, you got a card for if you transferred VD to somebody?
That's all you got is accidental, huh? All right, I'll take it.
Well, first let me thank you for answering the ad.
Now, what do you feel qualifies you to be an effective baby-sitter for Stewie?
Yeah. We couldn't run an ad that said no Portuguese, but... no Portuguese.
So, I see here you worked for a family for a number of years.
The position has been filled. Thank you very much. You can go now.
I didn't think it was gonna be this hard to choose a baby-sitter.
Yes, if only you were this discerning... when you picked that happening Bruce Jenner hairdo.
Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?
My God, I haven't been this exhilarated since Brian took me to see Les Miserables.
There will be a slight change in the cast tonight.
For this evening's performance... the role of Jean Valjean will be played by Kirk Cameron.
Unbelievable! Oh, my God! How lucky are we, huh? Hey, Stewie, what are you doing tonight? Oh, nothing. Just watching Kirk Cameron play Jean Valjean.
Peter, it's the end of the month, and I'm calling your tab.
Oh, man, how am I gonna come up with that kind of money?
You drop the tab, and your son can have Meg.
Are you out of your mind? You can't sell me, you fat son of a bitch!
What do you think of that, Neil? Daddy bought you a girlfriend.
Excuse me. If anybody is interested, I already have a girlfriend.
You rejected me too many times, Meg. I couldn't wait for you forever.
Peter, how could you have tried to sell our daughter?
All right, Lois, I don't want this to ruin our date night, so I'll make it up to you.
Oh, Peter. I'm sorry I tried to sell our daughter.
Yeah, you don't know how hard it was to find one of those in English.
Just my package. God delivered it, I signed for it.
I hope I don't make any social faux pas... like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's dinner party.
Hi, sorry I'm late. I was visiting my aunt in the hospital.
And I was gonna go out with him when I was ready to settle for him.
Take it off, get in the shower and bounce around for me.
Sweetie, your daddy and I are going to the movies tonight.
I'm gonna be cooler than Brian when he hangs out at the bowling alley.
Please go out with me. I'm just trying to make Neil jealous.
Yeah. That sounds cool, but I'm gonna be in the hospital that night.
Must I lock up your tongue with the rest of the silver?
Hey, little man. So you're the guy who's been trying to steal my girlfriend.
What kind of sick, twisted game are you playing at?
Stewie sounds a little cranky. I'll put him to bed.
Now go back to the quad and resume your Hacky Sack tourney!
I'm not gonna lie down for some frat-boy bastard... with his damn Teva sandals and his Skoal Bandits... and his Abercrombie & Fitch long-sleeved, open-stitched... crew-neck Henley smoking his sticky buds out of a soda can... while watching his favorite downloaded Simpsons episodes every night!
Yes, we all love Mr. Plow. You've got the song memorized, do you?
That is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at 1:00 in the morning.
The guy who just whiffed his way down the bar-skank ladder.
I want some BB's. My dad lets me shoot at cats.
It seems like only yesterday... he was just a stranger videotaping me through the window.
Big deal. He did that to me three years ago.
The production values were amazing, much better than Kramer vs. Predator.
You can't just disappear for three months and then suddenly decide... you want him back! You can't have him!
Maybe someday we'll get married and you can go up on me.
I was wrong to drive you away. We belong together.
Of course, I'm understandably skeptical of your newfound affection for me.
I can't believe we're going out. This is so cool.
All right, Meg, according to the contract... every night, you have to put on my pajamas.
Colin Farrell, so I was talking to my wife, Dixie, the other day... and she was saying that you weren't a very good actor.
I say, I think this is how you change a tire. But what do I know? I'm just a baby!
Here's your iPod, so you can listen to The Streaks while you gasp for air.
We may even be able to put in some sorghum this year.
I don't have a dual cassette player... so, you know, I had to hold the tape recorder up to the radio... so the quality is kind of sucky... but, you know, all the songs describe my feelings.
Come here, let me just hold you for a while.
Well, how about no more job? You hear that, Miss Fussy Britches?
I thought we were going to go all the way and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun.
Okay, okay. This time we really have to do it.
You want me to kill myself and you're not going to.
Hey, Stewie, there's something thunking around in the trunk of my car... and I can't get in there 'cause somebody busted the lock.
You know, I thought I'd be happy being with Neil, but I'm not.
Sweetheart, we'll figure some way to get you out of this.
The only way out is if Neil commits an infidelity.
Well, that's it then. We got to find somebody to seduce Neil.
And I don't even know how to get ahold of her.
It was just... Oh, my God, LaDawn! What's that on your neck?
It was all her friends. They were doing marijuana and heroin.
Well, I really don't know how this happened... but I guess this is the last time I get to see you.
Oh, dear God, what have I done? I've made a terrible mistake.
LOIS: I can't believe I'm doing this. It's so disgusting.
Don't worry, Meg. I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse.
Your boyfriend is violating both your contract and my wife.
Meg, I wasn't doing anything. Mrs. Griffin was just... You're bending it.
I don't understand, Meg. You don't want to be my girlfriend?
Well, I thought I did. But I guess I was just jealous.
Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you want to be with me... not because you have to.
How about we fire up the old Segway... and find a nice quiet field to do long division in?
I mean, a nice quiet field in which to do long division. Sorry.
He's going back to Cecilia? I can't believe I'm actually jealous.
Do I have what it takes? We'll find out. Don't miss it.
Well, here we are again. Another Saturday night with basic cable.
I suppose neither of us is really cut out for love, and we...
You know, more children get kidnapped at the grocery store than anywhere else.
What brilliant parenting, Lois. Leave a tiny infant with a plastic bag.
You know, I might asphyxiate myself, just to teach you a lesson.
Blast! Good Lord, Lois... either I was a C-section or you're Wonder Woman.
Chris, would you run and get some milk? And be sure to take it from the back.
I'm a little short. I'll have to put the ham back.
You know, I got some candy in my van, if your kid wants some.
Well, well! Look who's carrying a little flame for Glenn Close. What a surprise!
I have to do laundry, then I have a piano lesson... then I have to make dinner. I am so busy. Better hurry.
I'm just gonna go out in the hallway and throw up about something else.
And on this beautiful new china. You guys have a lot of new stuff.
You know, she bought me something yesterday... but I am not going to tell you what it is. I want you to guess. Just close your eyes.
Hey, Bonnie. Listen, why don't you stop with the questions, huh?
Like Peter did, when he used to entertain terminally ill kids.
All right, so I'm at the DMV the other day. Long lines. Long lines at the DMV.
But you'll find out all about that when you get...
You got something you want to say, there, Mr. Heckler?
It is settled, May. Our parents have consented... and you and I are to be married on the first warm, sunny day of spring.
I am sorry, but she is just awful. Is there any way...
I mean, can we add, like, a topless scene, or something?
God, you're right, Brian, I'm out of control... but I don't know what to do. I'm just hooked on the rush of shoplifting.
I haven't felt a thrill like this in a long time.
Well, I think you've had enough thrills. Why don't you just put everything back?
Okay, Brian. You know, you really are a good friend.
For those of you wondering... what I've been writing down as we go to commercial... it's a cat. Just a cat.
In other news, police are still looking for the culprit... who stole a valuable Matisse painting from the Quahog Museum of Art.
Also, scientists announced today... that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer.
We better ask directions at that creepy, and possibly haunted, house.
You know, you really should talk to a therapist about this.
I mean, it really helped Peter out... when he became obsessed with that fantasy world of his.
You know, Lois, we're just lucky... we got this under control before the police caught onto you.
Oh, crap. All right, look, just take it easy, Joe. All right, Lois will go peacefully.
Oh, my God, I am so embarrassed. Let me just get my purse.
Sorry, Lois. Regulations. I can't give you any special treatment.
Your Honor, I am so sorry for stealing all that stuff.
I've decided to go lenient and... Where the hell is my gavel?
I sentence you to two years in the State Prison.
Another outburst like that, Mr. Griffin, and I'll extend the sentence.
Oh, man, I haven't been this upset since I watched The Blob on television.
Look out behind you, lady! It's the Blob! I'll save you.
I wish she was here to clean up all this stuff.
Okay, now when we get to your mother's cage, say hello... but don't drag your ass, 'cause I want to go the reptile house.
You know, I love doing a woman in the can. Oh, giggidy, giggidy, goo!
I do hope nothing happens to spoil this fancy dinner party.
Oh, it is so good to see all of you. How is everything at home?
It's horrible, Lois. I've had to do all the things that you usually do.
Like the other night, I had to go to your book club meeting.
I really admired the mother character's admission of personal torment...
I felt a total lack of ethical integrity... in her readiness to abandon her children and start a life of her own.
Here's another thing: The book can also be... a hat.
Well, you know, that thing that you usually do for me every Thursday night.
I can't believe you're serving a three-year sentence, it seems so harsh.
The only upside is that it's given me time to think about why I ended up in here.
I guess I was stealing, because I was so sick of the same old routine.
I felt like I had a void in my life.
And I was trying to fill that hole with all kinds of expensive objects and things.
And I felt wonderful with all those things filling that hole.
I did this to myself... so I'm just gonna have to lay back and let the penal system teach me a lesson.
Well, I guess with good behavior, you could be out in two years.
I'm just gonna have to pay my debt to society.
Not necessarily. I think I got an idea of how to smuggle you out.
I have a very tough time standing up in the car.
Well, then we're fugitives. But at least the family's back together.
Wherever this van stops, we'll begin a new life together.
Well, at least I don't have to worry about the evil monkey here.
If we're gonna hide out here in Asiantown we have to find a place to live.
Yes, and we should do nothing to draw attention to ourselves as outsiders.
Hi there! Always nice to meet a fan of my movies.
Tell me about it. I haven't seen one female baby since we got here.
Come on, kids, we've been through worse. Meg, you remember when you found out... your gynecologist never finished med school?
All right, Meg, let's take a look at that bergina.
But Peter, how are we going to support ourselves here?
We'll all have to get jobs, but I'm sure we'll each find something we can do.
This used to be a people business, but now, I don't know.
Damn! I say, I seem to have sewn a shoe to my hand, may I go to the nurse?
So, what exactly would you say qualifies you to work as a sumo wrestler?
Oh, are you kidding? I'm a born athlete, just like Greg Louganis.
You're probably asking yourself, Which way are they gonna go? Are they gonna make a diving-board head-injury joke? Are they gonna make an AIDS joke? Or are they gonna make a joke about the fact... that his last name sounds suspiciously like 'anus'?
Well, we're gonna take the high road and do a no-body-hair joke.
Mayor West, we have every available man looking for the Griffins.
The rest of my Lite Brite pieces! My name isn't Adam We!
Or is it? Who am I? What number did you dial?
Don't ever call here again. I guess I told him!
Chris, I'm hungry. It's your turn to keep watch for the cops.
Wait a minute, am I the only one who thinks this is nuts?
Come on, Brian, a change of scenery is always good.
Oh, my God, we got to get out of here!
This sucks worse than that time I did cocaine with Karl Malden.
What are you getting all bent out of shape about?
Well, you know, Karl, I didn't get... I got virtually nothing here, you know?
Look, all I'm saying is, I got the raw end of the deal.
I always pretend I shooting at Alan Alda and Jamie Farr.
Look at us? We're running through a sewer, and it's because of me.
Look, honey, it was very sweet of you to break me out of jail... but I did something wrong.
And I'm the one who should pay, not my whole family.
I say, Corey Haim! Are you with the Goonies as well?
It was so nice of Joe to work things out with that judge.
Yeah, but I'm sure gonna miss my buddies down at the sumo ring.
Okay, so on the count to three, you try to push me out of the ring...
I try to push you out of the ring. Okay? Ready?
Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us
This is the tenth year my father's raced his yacht in the Newport Regatta.
Man, I hope he lets me on his team this year.
I haven't been part of a team since I was with the Four Peters.
I don't have worms, all right? I just got checked for worms.
Oh, God. What am I gonna do? I can't afford the medication for this.
I'm just saying, I'm proud of her. She's a woman.
Yes, that's very hot, and I'll deaI with it in the morning... but right now, I am exhausted.
Perhaps you should worry a little less about your pride... and a little more about the creepy-crawlies... shawshanking their way out of your balloon knot.
Thank God I finally get some time away from the eviI monkey in my closet.
The one with the civiI war, the one with the cocaine... or the one with the fancy hats?
You and I get to stay in my old high-schooI room.
Yeah, except for all the trophies and pictures of friends.
And the Grammy for Album of the Year goes to...
I sure was, Meg, when I was 16 years old.
Well, I wanted to, but your grandfather wouldn't let me.
Yes, I imagine those little fellows are enjoying quite a feast.
You know what's interesting? I've only been allve for six weeks.
I know nothing of the world beyond this dog's stomach.
Bet you're gonna need some big strapping men... to help you with your boat.
No. No, I just thought you might want some extra seamen... on your poop deck.
You could become rich beyond your wildest dreams... by selling these fine products over the phone.
Okay, girls. Are you all ready to play? all right, then. One, two, three. Green light.
Sorry, you have to sleep with Rob Schneider tonight. Making copies.  Remember that?
Ladies and gentlemen... welcome to the 20th annuaI Newport Regatta.
Newport would like to extend a speciaI welcome... to all those here today who have children stationed overseas in Iraq.
Say, where's your husband or as I call him, my son-in-lard?
Peter, what the hell are you doing in my bathtub?
I won't have a member of my family racing in a bathtub.
Well, Daddy, you didn't want Peter in your boat... so team Griffin is gonna give you a run for your money.
And now, to fire the starting gun... is recently paroled presidentiaI assassin, John Hinckley.
Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe I was wrong about all men.
There's the finish line. We can't let him beat us.
We gotta lose some extra weight. Quick, everyone, take off your clothes.
Not listening to you for once, Daddy... and look what happened.
I should've stopped listening to you a long time ago.
That's what we call a manatee, boys... or, in nauticaI slang, the sea-cow.
Don't lie to me, Brian. I know what this is.
I'll front you the money, and you pay it off by working for me.
Cashscam? Are you kidding? I don't want anything to do with that pyramid scheme.
Just be in my room tomorrow at 9:00 a. m. for orientation.
Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right.
We must keep this from the serfs lest they gain literacy... and threaten the landed gentry.
And you know what? I'm gonna take that chance... my father never let me take when I was younger.
Hey, that's fantastic, Lois. And I'll pleasure myself to your photos.
That greased-up deaf guy is going to be the death of me.
Well, gosh, Mort. You ever think about sending out a maller?
'Cause I know where you could get a good deaI on a modeI.
Oh, Brian, you're here. Good. Okay, let me give you the rundown.
You get 25 minutes for lunch, and... Enjoy it here.
You'll pick up the phone and you'll sell, sell, sell.
But before you go thinking it's all seriousness... the first Friday of every month is Wacky-Tacky-Tie Day... so, you know, start thinking up some fun tacky ties to wear.
Lois, could I be a son of a bitch and impose on you... to sign one of your flyers for me.
Oh, man. I can't believe I'm sleeping with a modeI.
We'll flip a coin. all right. Heads, Rhode Island. Talls, Ca-ca-poo-poo-pee-pee-shire.
Pardon me. Are you Lois Griffin, the Goldman's Pharmacy girI?
Listen, sugar, I've seen your stuff. You're a breath of fresh air in my stoma.
I could get you a lot more work if you sign with my agency.
Now, perhaps some young gentleman would like to light me up. allow me.
Yes, Grover, what is it? This has to be quick.
You know what? If you're gonna shout, we can just talk later.
Okay. all right, you know what? Call me back when you calm down.
Oh, yes. Can you go ahead and send Lois a congratulatory basket?
Oh, and if Cookie Monster calls, tell him I'm not talking to him... untiI he gets out of rehab.
No. No, Derek was in here earlier. He was making the beds.
Well, here we are, Lois. Your first professionaI photo shoot.
If I can just have a few moments of your time...
Oh, Brian, there you are. Can I talk to you about something?
That coffee mug you have on your desk that says, Life's a beach... that's dangerously close to the word bitch, isn't it?
And, you know, between you and me, I think it's a stitch... but some of the other employees have found it offensive.
Other employees? Who else works here besides me? ...you. That's who works here!
Wow, Lois, look at you. You're like Britney Spears... except you're not a fat guy.
Dad, how could you be okay with Mom parading herself around like this?
I mean, she's half-naked. It makes all women look bad.
Lois, I got your new headshots, and I set up a shoot for you... over at Glamour next Monday... but, sugar, you're gonna need these to stay on top.
Lois, sooner or later every modeI needs a little boost, huh?
I just wanna make sure you got everything you need.
Hey, who's putting together a puzzle? 'Cause I just found a hot piece.
I'd like to split you in half like a piece of lumber.
Yeah, Lois. I'd like to wear you like a hockey mask.
Lois, I'd like to make a carameI-colored baby with you.
Jacket off. Jacket off. Jacket off. all right. all right. That's it. That's enough.
Lois, if you being a modeI means you're going to be eye-candy... for the whole town, then I ain't going for it.
Excuse me? Who do you think you are, my father?
Lowering yourself and women and something and all that noise.
I am going to the top, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.
I got a wax this morning, and let's just say...
You're acting all weird, and you're staying out all night.
I was just out with some of the girls, and you're not gonna believe this.
That guest list is more exclusive than the Garden of Eden.
So, basically, you can eat from any tree you want, except this one.
You know, I would just not go near it at all.
Brian, thanks for showing up so promptly for your quarterly evaluation.
Now, then. I'm going to do something I call the compliment sandwich... where I say something good, then talk about where you need improvement... and then end with something good.
You really dazzled that rep from the Cincinnati office last week.
That is sensationaI. You really made me feeI confident about those numbers.
Listen, if you're ever looking for a change of scenery... we could sure use a fellow like you in Cincinnati.
I mean, she's acting crazier than I did that time I tried Ecstasy.
I'm really worried about her, Mr. Pewterschmidt... and I figured I'd come to you since you were always good at reeling her in.
Well, Lois was always a wild stallion... but don't worry. I know how to controI her.
And I'll help you... but first, you have to do something for me.
Yeah. Yeah. That's hot. That's hot. all right, let's do this.
You know, Brian, there was a note in the suggestion box that says: Stewie should eat a steaming bag of...
Well, I'm not gonna say the last word, but I think you know what it is.
Look, Brian, a corporation is a lot like a centipede.
It only works if all the legs are moving toward the same end.
Don't think about coming back and shooting up the place... because security has your picture.
You're not leaving this room untiI you agree to stop this modeling thing... once and for all.
I mean, if Lois wants to be a modeI... we don't got any right to stop her.
Of course, I do. I just want you to be happy.
This is ridiculous. No daughter of mine is going to be happy.
Well, Lois, I guess you should go ahead and get back to your party.
Aren't you gonna go do your little turn on the catwalk, Lois?
Well, now that you say you're fine with it... to be honest, I'm not really sure I wanna do it anymore.
I think all I really wanted was the freedom to know I could... and now I have it because I have you.
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us
And now back to Old People Agree With Arnold Palmer.
Tomato soup, grilled cheese, and a weak cup of tea... is the best lunch in my book.
Don't forget you have to go to the PTA meeting.
Me? Go to a PTA meeting? What, are you high?
By the way, we're out of chips, cookies, and Funny Bones.
Now, I'm going to my book club and you are going to the meeting.
Hey, Brian, how about you go to that meeting for me, huh?
Quagmire, what are you doing here? You don't have kids.
Don't be so sure, Brian. I've slept with chicks all over the world.
Well, I'm Brian and... gosh, if I'm not being too forward, it's lovely to meet you, Miss Parks.
So, Brian, you ready to go play some darts at The Clam?
Sorry, Peter. I can't make it tonight. I have a date.
You were supposed to drive tonight. What am I supposed to do?
If I drive, I'll have to have a bunch of drinks first... because I am very self-conscious about my driving.
Do you see that? Do you see what I did?
I made it seem as though you were a homosexuaI.
That'll be more pathetic than that game of Marco Polo I played with Helen Keller.
I don't know. I mean, I think I want to have kids someday.
I can't get enough of those little buggers, let me tell you.
You know, it's like I tell the other volunteers down at the adoption center:
My God, you know, if I could just take all the orphans in the world... and just, you know, buy a farm somewhere... and let them all run free, you know.
Just let them do little macaroni-art pictures of their dead parents.
So what's it like to work at a high schooI?
You know, I've always wondered why they named if after James Woods, you know?
Like, just, you know, off the top of my head, I don't know...
You know, those are just three names that come to mind.
We should get them to rename the schooI after Dr. King.
You like Dr. King? Because I love Dr. King. I love... M.L.K!
He's... I mean, I love all black people, you know.
I mean, if I could take all the black people in the world... and just, you know, just buy a farm somewhere and let them all...
Whoa, you know what, that actually didn't really come out right.
Brian, relax. I'm having a great time. You don't have to try so hard.
Great. Great. 'Cause, you know, I'm not okay with slavery. Just so we're clear.
I mean, if I was offered a slave, I'd say no.
By the way, Bonnie... we just finished reading The Da Vinci Code at my book club.
Well, this is a bigger surprise than that time Peter vanished into thin air.
I thought you'd disappeared, otherwise I wouldn't have picked my...
Great, leave when I'm in the middle of a sentence.
Hey, there you are, Brian. We're all set for tonight, right?
Oh, tonight's no good, Peter. I have another date with Shauna.
Well, fine, Brian. If that girI is more important to you than me... then I guess I'll have to find a new best paI.
Boy, Barney, it's sure been great hanging out with you.
Hey, you almost done in the john? 'Cause we're late for darts. all done, Peter.
I don't need Brian to watch TV with. I got you, Meg.
Somebody at the door? What are you gonna do about it?
This is wonderfuI. Look at this, Peter. Two hundred die in train derallment.
I mentioned to Shauna that they ought to change the name of James Woods High... to Martin Luther King, Jr., and she really ran with it.
You and your girlfriend are taking the name James Woods off the high schooI?
You're gonna name the schooI after the star of Space 1999?
No, it's Tom Berenger. We were looking for Tom Berenger.
Well, thanks for playing. I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
Oh, that's okay. I had a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of the show.
Peter, Martin Luther King was an inspiration to an entire generation.
He was a driving force behind the civiI rights movement.
Lois, we're talking about Rhode Island's own James Woods here.
He's a hero in these parts, huh? Use your head.
Oh, yeah? I don't like the way you've been acting lately.
I think it has a lot to do with that woman... you've been spending so much time with.
Why don't you just mind your own damn business, Peter?
Well, Mr. Griffin, your arguments for the schooI's name change... are quite compelling.
By the way, I just want to remind everybody... to put their e-mall address on the list in the back there... so we can send you our quarterly newsletter.
It's chock-full of goings-on around the schooI. It's got a word jumble.
A little hint: all the answers have to do with something here at the schooI.
Now, unless there is any objection, I move that the board pass this measure.
He brought James Woods here? What the hell is he doing?
Oh, God! I told you I'd get her to say it.
Oh, God! all right. Go on. Get out of here.
Look, I came as soon as Peter contacted my website.
Let me just say, I'm all in favor of renaming the schooI after Dr. King.
Yes! This is more exciting than that time I got to ride the washing machine.
Man, what a great lunch, Lois. Thank you so much for having me over.
Okay, let me just go ahead and stop you right there. You sound terrible, all right?
You're doing this thing, which is just, you know... What the hell is that?
And you look like if I touched you, you'd be sticky... and frankly, you smell bad.
Well, actually, you know when you smell something and it gets stuck in there... and you can sort of taste it?
Yeah. Well, I'm tasting you right now and it tastes awfuI.
Oh, Brian, there you are. Look who's here for lunch.
Peter, can I talk to you in the living room?
I can't believe you went to that much effort just to sabotage me.
Listen, at least I wasn't trying to change the name of the schooI... to impress my girlfriend.
Oh, yeah? Then why did you pick Martin Luther King?
Oh, it's just Reagan. Just leave him alone. He'll tire himself out.
You're just jealous because I'm hanging around with someone else.
Well, fine. Then maybe I'll go see her right now.
Oh, man, I thought maybe you could stick around... and, you know, maybe you and me could be pals.
You know what? I'm gonna check back into my hoteI.
His sweater was neatly folded on the grave... so we went back to the car... and the severed hook was hanging from the door handle... because the calls were coming from inside the house.
Boy, James Woods, you're the best friend a guy could ever have.
Would you like some corn? I brought it from home.
Peter? You're still not friends with that idiot after what he did?
I'm not going to avoid Peter like the drunk chick at a party.
And as far as I'm concerned, it's either him or me.
Shauna, come on, why you want to play a brother like that?
I brought it from home, because I don't like the creamed corn they have here.
Peter, I'm sorry, I was a jerk. Let's be friends again. Okay.
Listen, I'm sorry for everything that's happened between us... and I figure, I don't know, I thought maybe we could be friends again, huh?
What do you say? I kind of miss sleeping at the foot of your bed.
Look, Lois. Lois, look, look, look. He's dreaming he's running.
Okay, James, you ready? Now catch it in your mouth like Brian.
You know what? This is boring. I got a better idea.
Yeah, I think you're really going to appreciate... all the subtle nuances in my performance.
See? For example, see how even though this other guy is talking... your eye is drawn to me.
You know, it's bad enough that Peter and I were fighting... but ever since he met James Woods, it's like I don't even exist.
Do you really care about a man who used to try and pick up girls... at the Miss USA Pageant?
Hey, how's it going? I'm Peter. You want to go out sometime?
You know what? To hell with you, then. Yeah, go to hell.
I'm Peter. What do you say you and me go get a couple of beers, maybe we could...
I don't care. I don't care. I don't need you.
I got a coupon for Sizzler with your name on it.
Brian, I know you're upset now, but if there's anything I've learned in this life... is that you can't let the little things...
Turns out he wasn't very good at catching stuff with his mouth.
I don't know, Peter, I had this crazy idea... that you and I were supposed to have dinner tonight.
Oh, that's fun. That sounds like you had a fun time.
And where would I fit in with the fun time?
I'll act however I want to act, you son of a bitch!
Boy, I haven't been this creeped out since I saw that episode of Star Trek.
If I whispered in your ear that Commander Worf's head... looks like a fanny, would you join me in a laugh?
Boy, I tell you, Brian, James Woods has been getting kind of obsessive... ever since you and me started hanging out again.
We got to come up with some crazy scheme like the kids on That '70s Show.
And I think I got it. all right, that's the last of the Reese's Pieces.
'Cause if it's me under there again, I'm gonna be really pissed off.
It's good to have you back in that spot, Brian.
By the way, what did you end up doing with James Woods?
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us
He's a family guy all right, boys. Let's see what we've got.
I can't afford to keep you. I'm gonna have to put you down.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I love you both. So, sorry. I'll always love you.
Can you ask your thighs if they borrowed my Gap capris?
They did not and are insulted that you've asked such a thing.
As insulted as Kitty Kelley... when people accuse her of taking liberties with her best-selling tell-alls.
Oh, honey, how was your day? Did you catch any fish?
Then killed him, and hollowed him out into an ashtray for Stewie.
Peter, we have a family to feed. We all count on you to provide for us.
I must look like a bigger loser than when I was on that game show.
Okay, Peter. Listen closely and tell us... if this is a song by Icelandic vocallst Bjork... or, the rantings of former comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.
I tell you, fellows, if I don't find some fish out there soon... my family's gonna go hungry.
If it's fish you wants, Pelican's Reef is where you'll find them.
I've seen fish there. More fish than you could possibly imagine.
I guess, would be the main bullet point of this presentation.
Many have gone. all have been lost. Vanished, never to be seen again.
I guess, would be the centraI theme of what I'm trying to get across here.
'Cause I'm not afraid of a challenge. Like that time I outfarted MichaeI Moore.
How are you doing? all right, everybody. I'll be back in a week.
Meg, if you get intimate with a guy, make him wear this.
Dad, that's a garbage bag. Don't you mean a condom?
So you can watch the sea untiI I return. Go on, try it out.
Boy, I really appreciate you guys helping me out on this.
Peter, we're your friends. We're always there for you in your time of need.
You gotta drink if you did the thing that the person says they never did.
I never slept with a woman with the lights on.
I never had sex with Cleveland's wife. all right, let's see.
I never did a chick in a Logan airport bathroom.
I never gave a reach around to a spider monkey... while reciting the pledge of allegiance.
I never picked up an illegaI allen at Home Depot... to take home and choke me, while I touched myself.
I never did the same thing but with someone from Jo-Ann Fabrics.
Oh, boy. He's out cold. Hey, let's write on him.
But me, I like the visuaI slapstick gag. Like this comically oversized powder puff.
In locaI news, we have more on the approach of Hurricane RuPauI... which is working his or her way up the coast.
Let's go live to Ollie Williams with the blackie weather report.
Coming up next, a pig who refuses to eat Jews.
Don't worry, Lois. Peter's good at getting out of trouble.
Not only will I be able to put food on the table, and pay all my bills...
Holy crap, here come Jesus And he doesn't look too happy
And their vesseI was swept to the bottom of the briny deep.
They sank, I guess, would be the one thing... to take away from this part of the seminar.
When we come back, I'll show you... how eye contact can make or break any business relationship.
Yeah. See, now this is why I didn't say anything.
There it is boys, the Fountain of Youth. Just like I told you.
We gather today to remember those brave Quahog men... who were lost at sea.
So, let us now take our vengeance on this murderous ocean.
I know, sweetie. I'm sad, too. But you're making a scene. all our friends are here.
But I promise, one day I'll see you again, Captain Caveman.
What would you guys rather be? Blind or a midget?
Yeah, and every woman I did would be CheryI Tiegs.
You guys are crazy. Hey, you don't wanna be a midget?
One of those funny little guys running around... getting in all kinds of shenanigans.
Smoking a cigar, while you're riding around in a stroller.
Black or crippled? all right, fellas. We've been out here for months.
And being there's no women around, we're gonna have to have an orgy.
And whoever's toe that is, I appreciate your enthusiasm... but I think, you can stop.
And if you look off the left side of the ship... you'll see a bunch of homosexuals.
Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich, we'll get you to the hospitaI.
There's nothing good about what you do or who you are.
I can't tell you how happy I am that you're allve.
I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but I got remarried.
It was a very difficult time and he was there for us.
This is just like that sitcom where there's two dads.
He even took a job selling cars to keep the family afloat.
Well, just get a divorce and everything will be back to normaI.
It's not that easy. What am I supposed to tell Brian?
Thanks for saving our family, now scram. And besides, he's been great with the kids.
And Meg even went on a date with the announcer from the Super Friends.
Fine. I can see, I'm not wanted here. Maybe I'll just find my own place.
You know what? Maybe I'll just go take up my old job... as a construction worker in New York.
You know, I know, your head must be turned upside down... by this whole Peter thing.
So, you know, if there's anything you wanna talk about...
I'll admit this is an emotionaI time for me but you and I are married... and that's the way it's gonna stay.
So any possibility of... tonight being the night we finally push the beds together.
Jeez, enough with that already. You're like a dog with a bone.
Transplant. They belonged to a death row inmate who got the chair.
Guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Lois is the only woman for me.
Well, then, it sounds like you've gotta find a way to win her back.
Yeah, like we could get her drunk and take turns having sex with her.
Yeah, yeah. Then, no. No, then, that wouldn't help you.
I just gotta figure out a way to win Lois back.
I once built that time machine out of a DeLorean. all right, past. Here I come.
What are you doing here and where are your clothes?
You know, I'd leave my ass behind... if it wasn't so perfectly attached to my sternum.
Look, Peter, I know what you're trying to do... but it's not gonna work. I'm married to Brian.
Oh, that's right. How inappropriate of me. Well, I guess, I should be going.
You knock it off. You're the one with the magnet.
Oh, who am I kidding? I can't fight this anymore.
Lois, I smell whipped cream. Are you making strawberry shortcake?
So it's a shouting match you want, eh? Well, game on, Quahog.
Hey, Griffin, your sales are in the toilet. You got problems at home?
Ex-husband back in the picture, you're working during the day.
They got time to bump uglies. That's right, I said, bump uglies.
Shut up, Paddy, you're crazy. Lois would never cheat on me.
I'm looking for a car that's been tricked out to look like an ice-cream truck.
And it plays a tune that's fun for the young children.
I would enjoy having it, yes. Give it to me.
I'm sorry, Lois, I was mistaken. I thought you threw the ball in there... but I can see now you still have it.
Perhaps you'd like to see... what Lois and the fat man have been up to in your absence.
Hello, MTV, I think I would be perfect for The ReaI World.
Because I speak my mind and not everyone likes that.
But I'm not afraid to go there. And I can be sexy.
Look at my fanny, look at my fanny, look at my fanny.
Peter, I can't keep sneaking around with you like this.
And the other thing is, Lois, hi, he's a dog.
Please. Please don't make this any harder than it has to be.
You know, I will always love you, but I made a commitment to Brian.
I can never repay him for what he's done for this family.
I find it's easy if I make it into a little song.
Red, green, blue, green, blue, blue Then you put in words
I like tea and cakes for tea and cake time
I just don't think you're the right woman for me.
Maybe you should see if Peter will still take you back.
There's no possible way I can ever thank you enough for this.
And to think, Brian, I was, like, a day away from having sex with you.
I was gonna push those beds together... and take you around the freaking world, Brian.
But a nice pat on the head is just as good, huh?
Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us
These are my back-to-schooI clothes. I start high schooI tomorrow.
Oh, boy. You better watch out for the Freshman Hunt.
Yeah. That's where seniors hunt down freshmen and nall them with paddles.
Man, remember how much that was, beating those freshmen silly?
Chris, I'm just as serious as I was when I saw PauI Reiser do standup.
What's the deaI with airline food? I mean, is this stuff bad or what?
It's supply and demand. It's the foundation of our entire economy, PauI.
And who do I talk to about those long lines at the ATM?
Someone who has time to fritter away, but not me.
Peter, what're you doing? You've been out of work forever.
You promised me you were going out to look for a job today.
Although I suppose they're not the first couple to have problems.
Anything... Anything in there, maybe you wouldn't have wanted him to see?
Come on, Karen. Do you hate your body so much... you have to reduce every painting of the female form to pornography?
It is your fault. I just want to come home and have dinner.
And have my wife say, Hello, how was your day? That's impossible for you.
This is about your disrespect for me, this family and everything we stand for.
What do we stand for? Who are we, the Goracks now?
That's what you want, isn't it? You want to be Cynthia Gorack.
You know what, at least Cynthia Gorack's husband cares about her family.
I can't even talk to you when you're like this.
Okay. It's over now because you say it is. Way to go, Karen.
And it's so obvious I don't care about the family.
I just killed a 700-pound tiger with a stick and a rock!
You know what, Karen. Go! I'm not going to stop you. Just go!
Yeah, if you did that more often, maybe I wouldn't need these paintings!
He had some strippers in the studio. They sounded hot.
Then he made a joke about a negro. But Robin laughed, so it was okay.
The Freshman Hunt doesn't really exist. It's just a myth to scare freshmen.
I'm going to teach you the lesson that it is not okay to be a freshman. all right, Mr. Griffin. Jobs you think you would be suited for.
Let's see what you wrote. Cowboy, astronaut... warlock, more powerfuI astronaut, beer expert.
Yeah. And I need something that pays more than my last job as...
No, don't get that. That's a bad cereaI. Get some of the Boo Berry.
Turns out there's a job opening at the Pawtucket Brewery.
Wow, that sounds even better than when I got paid to take part in that study.
The only one who couldn't finish the puzzle is the fat one.
I'm sorry. I can't see what you're going for here. Let me look at...
Yeah, I guess that's what all the red pieces were.
No, I hate it. I never want to go back!
Oh, come on, it'll get better. You just have to find your place.
I'll carve out a niche as the effeminate male friend of the popular girls.
I got a case of wine coolers, so we can drink every time Ryan seethes.
Oh, it's... I just did some stuff for a guy in the parking lot.
I don't care what she says. I'm never going back!
I joined the Peace Corps and a day later, I was two continents away.
But 6,000 miles and all the dope I could smoke... still couldn't separate me from my problems.
And this was good dope. I mean, it was growing everywhere.
Oh, my God. This one time, we got so baked... we ended up eating all the food the World Health Organization... had airlifted in. Man, those villagers were so pissed.
They tried to chase us, but let me just say, thank God for polio.
Is Peter here? I want to re-hire him. My new eye isn't working out.
I like pancakes, I like pancakes They make me a happy Peter
I am happy, I am happy, la la la la la.
You bet. I'm starting my new job at the brewery.
Finally, I'm one of those guys who can't wait to get to work in the morning.
Well, where the hell would he get an idea like that?
Wait a second. Don't we know someone who was in the Peace Corps?
I am positive we know somebody who was in the Peace Corps.
Look, it's me, all right. He got the idea from me.
And before you fly off the handle, you may want to think about it.
The kid's obviously confused. This might be good for him.
Like the time my agent dropped that bomb on me.
Taxi. Taxi. Taxi! all right, Chris. We're approaching your assigned village.
Tell the people to work together and drink clean water.
And by the way, the word colored still flies down there. So, get your fill.
Our air is clean. Our food is bountifuI and our water is caffeine-free.
Hey, how you doing? Give me a word, any word at all... and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickeI.
I'll be home in a month, after people have forgotten I'm a freshman.
Listen, I am swamped... but Mom has kept me up to date on everything you're doing... and I think it's just great. Hanging up now.
Boy, this place sure has changed since Pawtucket Pat sold it.
Oh, and I should mention, employees are welcome to free Pawtucket Ale.
We just ask that you don't drink during your shift.
Mr. I don't have time for your Little League games.
Why do you close your eyes when we make love?!
I wonder how your father's first day at work went?
I'll have a triple cheeseburger and a large fries and...
My dad got a job at the brewery and he gets lots of free beer.
Chris, thank you for helping bring water to my village.
Excellent. As soon as I release this biologicaI toxin... into the world's water supply, I will rule the world.
I just have to remember to make sure this cap is screwed on tight.
This is a gift from all of us. Go ahead, try it on.
Only I'm not crying and trying to pretend I'm somewhere else.
Mr. Griffin, since you can't controI your drinking... you've been demoted to the shipping department.
Mr. Griffin, we have different rules here. For starters, no drinking. Period.
He is a burden of the state, deemed unfit for mainstream society.
He said he wants you to put your finger in his mouth.
Mr. Griffin, although I may not fully understand Opie's management style... he has proven himself a more competent employee than you.
Damn it! This is worse than being Kevin Federline's magic mirror!
Magic mirror, how can I look like a douchebag today?
Well, Kevin, I would say, first of all, don't shave or shower.
I would say, just go ahead and wear that tank top all day.
Okay. all right, so we covered the hygiene, no collared shirts.
Oh, and don't forget to walk around with an undeserved sense of accomplishment.
Chris, the festivaI of the harvest is the time of celebration for my people.
You send my souI sky high when your lovin' starts
And take me dancing tonight Do, do do do do.
This is a joyous occasion. You've engaged the entire tribe in dance.
According to our customs, you're now married to my daughter.
Well, if you're happy then I'm happy, because after all... What?
I'm tired of always scrounging around on the bottom rung of society... getting kicked around by the Man.
Like when I worked in that lab with Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.
Okay, he says he's doing great, having a wonderfuI time...
We'll be landing in South America shortly. Please buckle your seat belts.
I told you, Peter. I never should have let him out of my stomach.
This is bigger news than when I toured Europe... with that musicaI rendition of My Left Foot.
Well, maybe here, but not in America, where God pays attention.
You guys got an ATM? I only got $37 on me.
Wow, no Griffin's been this powerfuI since my ancestor King Arthur Griffin.
Arthur, if you are able to draw the sword from the stone... and prove to me you truly are the sole king of Camelot...
I will make love to you right here in the clearing.
What if I can just move it an inch, will you touch me?
This is amazing. You've got the biggest hut in the village and all these servants... and you've only spent $1.50.
That's a hell of a lot less than I had to spend... to go see that piece-of-crap remake of Bewitched.
Guess what? I'm a Clippers fan. all ticketed passengers for Flight 2378 to Reno, Nevada...
Peter, this is ridiculous. We came here to take Chris home.
Because I'm tired of being treated like crap at work.
Don't you see what this means to me? I'm somebody here.
Finally, a white man has an opportunity to be rich and in charge.
Look closely at his sinewy muscular form and unusuaI vitallty.
It is a thrill to watch him dig a ditch or lift a jug of water or participate in a hunt.
Peter paid the villagers to reenact the Contest episode of Seinfeld.
Dad, I've had enough of you taking advantage of these people.
For God's sake, the woman playing Elaine is a high priestess.
I don't have to take that from you. I'm the richest guy in town.
Dad, don't you see? This is a wonderfuI place... and you're just using it to escape from your problems at home.
I mean, you just came here because you were being picked on at schooI.
I married this 11-year-old girI for all the wrong reasons.
I guess I just came here because I was afraid of being a freshman.
I guess you can't run away from your problems anywhere.
You will be punished for your decadent ways on the first day of Radaman. You...
Maybe Dennis Radaman is going to punish you with his crazy hair. No?
I'm not gonna be able to do it now. I'm not... OK, OK. I know.
I gotta get... I gotta get all the laughs out. OK.
Stop making that face. What are you doing? He makes that face and it makes me laugh.
You know what? Just turn around. I don't care where you look. Just look over there.
Mr I Can't Do A Suicide Bombing Because I'm Sick.
He had a note... He had a note from his doctor. He brought a note from his doctor.
OK. All right. OK. Here we go. Here we go. All serious now. OK.
I can't... I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't...
Come on. Now you're just trying to make... Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I should do the whole tape with this in my hand.
Just with the chicken right here. Everyone will be, like, What the hell?
Let him do it. Let him do the tape. Don't blame me. It was the chicken. He was...
Completely serious, like I don't even know I'm wearing them.
What? What are you looking at? Do I have something on my face?
I'm just wearing my regular glasses. I always wear these. What?
Yeah, he got it. He got it over there. The little guy got it.
Good day to you, sir. And now prepare to die.
And don't ever let me catch you guys in Quahog.
Meg sucks. Everything she does is so freaking terrible and depressing.
Robin Hood, the king is keeping me prisoner here in his castle.
Boy, you guys are not sucking me into the story at all.
I'm just telling for your own benefit. I'm very aware that I'm watching a play right now.
If you're gonna shoot me you might want to tie your shoelaces first.
Well, I could tell you, but I'd rather show you through interpretive dance.
You know, Lois, if we leave now, we can catch the Emmy for best documentary.
Wait a minute. You can't fool me that easily. You are not watching the Emmys.
Thanks for having me to your birthday party, Peter. Make a wish.
Our top story, beloved entertainer Bob Hope briefly came back to life, only to die in a tragic motorcycle accident.
In other news, actor David Hyde Pierce created a major controversy at the Emmys, when a trouser malfunction caused him to expose his testicles.
That's great. Thanks to you, I missed a moment of television history.
Well, now you know how George W Bush felt when he showed up in Vietnam.
Oh, man. Oh, man, I just got your messages and... I'm sorry.
Son of a bitch! Took you this long to tell me. Break it out.
We got 20 calls about the David Hyde Pierce incident.
As you know, one call equals a billion people, which means 20 billion people were offended by this.
Sir, what course of action do you recommend regarding the Hyde Pierce incident?
You've got to censor television, you fools. Now, follow my orders.
Jack, are you out there? I want to show you my new bikini.
What? Why are they blocking out all the good stuff?
The FCC must be overreacting to the David Hyde Pierce incident.
They let Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV and she looks like a foot.
Well, Peter, I'm flattered you came to me for help. We'll have more after this.
We're back. To answer your question, if you want to control content, start your own TV station.
My own TV station. I haven't had my own business since that mail-order operation.
I bought a giant, life-size slingshot from you. Itjust slammed me into a mountain.
Dad's starting his own TV station, but I'm not supposed to tell Mom because she'll just bitch him out.
I'm saving television. Apache Chief, put the satellite on the roof.
Well, that was the high point of my day. Guess I'll go gamble.
Hi there. I'm Peter Griffin, and you're watching PTV, with your favourite shows as nature intended them - with all the sex, violence, swearing and farts intact, like in All in the Family, where Archie got the Jeffersons to move.
Edith, will you stifle yourself? We're supposed to be incognitus.
And who could forget that classic episode of The Waltons?
Peter, look at these numbers. We're a hit. I'd think about expanding your programming.
Brian, that's a great idea. That's exactly what we need to take PTV to the next level.
Hi, and welcome to The Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour, a wonderful look back on all the partial nudity network television used to offer.
You gotta be careful about what you put on your network.
Shiksa, don't start with me. I forgot to go, I should've gone.
You look so haggard. Lie down or your heart might go...
Don't worry. I got a bunch of great new shows lined up.
You ate it? But I told you my boss was coming for dinner.
Norman Mailer will read an excerpt from his latest book, and we have a girl from Omaha who's hiding a banana.
We'll find out where. Giggety giggety, giggety goo. Stick around.
I want you to cancel that show with the animals having sex.
There are worse things for children than TV, like when Peter baby-sat the neighbours' kid.
Couldn't find your toys, so why don't you just play with this blow-dryer and these rattles?
Guess that's it. You probably want me out of your hair, so here's the Drano in case there's a clog.
Soap's right there next to the radio, and towels are on the roof.
It's one thing if a network runs inappropriate shows I can't do anything about, but I won't have it happening in my house.
We're here on the I95 overpass doing our first segment, I Dare You To Crap Off Of That.
We'll spend the day crapping off things that others have dared us to crap off.
Before you yell, let me remind you that you recklessly drove into oncoming crap.
It was inexcusable, Peter, and Stewie may never be able to ride in the car again.
Turn off the windshield wipers. They don't work. They're making it worse.
Peter, that's it. I asked you to stop this and you didn't listen to me.
They will clean up all your talking in a menace such as this
They will make you take a tinkle when you want to take a piss
There's no negotiation with the fellas at the freakin' FCC
Make ajoke about your bowels and they order in the troops
Any baby with a brain could tell them everybody poops
You'll never win by messin' with the fellas at the freakin' FCC
And if you find yourself with some young, sexy thing
So they sent this little warning, they're prepared to do their worst
And they stuck it in your mailbox hoping you could be coerced
I can think of quite another place they should have stuck it first
Mr Griffin, that was terrific, but I'm here to tell you that as of today, PTV is shut down.
Shut me down, huh? Well, you'll have to catch me first.
We're tired of you infecting people with your smut. It's an epidemic. It must be contained.
Well, Mr FCC, you can stop PTV, but you can never stop people from being who they are.
His chin looks like balls. Want me to cover that too?
Until you and all of Quahog start to clean up your act, like when Ozzy Osbourne stopped biting heads off bats.
Before I start playing, I'm gonna eat this whole sandwich.
Lois, these eggs are scrambled. I thought for sure you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.
You brought this on yourself by putting on those filthy shows.
You know what I mean - when you... lubed up... toothpaste in my... cherry... Episcopalian... extension cord... wetness... with a parking ticket - that is the best.
Everyone must wear this device that converts all fart sounds into Steven Wrightjokes.
I spilt spot remover on my dog. Now he's gone.
I know it's a little extreme, but when it comes to our children, it's better to err on the safe side, right?
No. You know, if everybody was as closed-minded as you, the world wouldn't have some of its most inspired creations.
You can have sex, just no moaning, no tongue kissing, no thrusting, no movement whatsoever.
Sorry. I haven't had sex in two weeks. I'm just a little on edge lately.
There wasn't this much tension when the slaves were freed.
OK, so you're free to go. But we're cool, right?
I thought this FCC thing was a good idea at first, but it's just gone way too far.
Well, I don't want to admit it, but I think you were right.
I set that thing up 15 years ago. Hey, where's the clown?
We've gotta do something about this. Pack your bag, Peter. We're going to Washington.
East of Eden? So you pretty much do whatever Oprah tells you to.
This book's been around for 50 years. It's a classic.
You just got it last week. There's an Oprah sticker on it.
Is that what that is? Let me peel that right off.
And the motion carries. The janitor's new nickname is Sweepy.
This government's FCC is trying to take the farts away from television, and all the sex and nudity and all the poop.
Well, I say it's wrong. These things are part of the fabric of American life.
We appreciate your passion, but this Congress supports the FCC.
Yeah? Well, I can prove to you that that's a bunch of bull. Look around you.
The Washington Monument. Looks an awful lot like a penis, doesn't it?
And the Pentagon? Well, you look me in the eye and tell me it doesn't look like a big anus.
He's right. Have you ever looked closely at the Lincoln Memorial?
Our top story, the FCC's content ban on Quahog has finally been lifted.
Look what I did. Isn't it the biggest, most super-special poop you've ever seen?
Well, Cindy, I guess it's true that big things come in small packages.
This is gonna be a fun day. Much better than that day I tried TAG body spray for sick cats.
You're cute. You're cute. I don't wanna pet you, though.
What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?
Oh! Oh, no! OK, no. Yeah, no, this spray is not for me.
You'll have a lot to write after we win the costume contest.
OK, everyone, Alan Thicke will be up in a minute to answer your hate mail, but first, the winners of this year's costume contest, the A-Team with the real black guy.
OK, you can stop with that cigar now, Gary. My sinuses will thank you.
Brian, I read your article in the Daily Shopper. It was wonderful.
It almost felt like it was written by a real writer.
I read your article too. You should spend less time working for the paper and more time working on that novel you've been working on.
I was using the Daily Shopper to shoo away a homeless person and I saw your article.
We'd love to talk to you about becoming a contributor. Come by tomorrow.
Two o'clock. They want me to contribute to The New Yorker.
The New Yorker? You'll fit in there as well as I did at Woodstock.
Excuse me, it's been brought to my attention that a few bad apples are smoking marijuana.
Wow, thanks. That means a lot coming from you guys.
Peter, it's been two weeks. Don't you think it's time to take off your A-Team costume?
Yeah, I guess so, but part of me wished we could just be the A-Team forever, you know?
Oh, this damn chair keeps wobbling. I think one of the legs is short.
Hey, if we could fix that wobbly chair, think of what else we could do for our community.
Cleveland's right. It seems it's our destiny to be the A-Team after all.
In 2005, a group of local misfits won a costume contest at an '80s TV convention.
If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
So I said to him, Brown liquor before Labor Day? What, do you work for Esquire?
Oh, Brian, how droll. We'll have to put that into a cartoon, or as we call it, an illustrated laughing square.
You went to Harvard? I'm an Ivy-League man myself. I went to Brown.
My incarcerated business partner's retarded gay niece went to Brown. What year?
Brian, The New Yorker does not employ your kind. You, sir, are fired.
I can't believe they fired you. How come you never told us you dropped out of college?
It didn't work out too well for Kristy McNichol, but then again, nothing did.
I was only one course shy of graduating and I just cracked under the pressure.
Don't take it too hard. You're not the first person to get fired.
Louis, the French people really wanna thank you for your services as king, but, it's just not working out and we've decided to go another way, so...
I just heard the dog got fired. Did I miss it? Did he cry yet?
Oh, come on, dog. cry for me. Ah, there you are.
Oh, yeah, cry for Stewie. Life isn't what you thought it would be.
Boy, not graduating from college has haunted me for years.
Well, if you only had one class left why don't you just go back and finish?
Well, this is boring. Let's go see what Meg is up to.
Miss watching you crash and burn in this misguided attempt to finish college?
You're not staying. I'll call Lois and have her pick you up.
I bleed a lot. Can I have the top bunk?
He already has a roommate - me. We're a couple of crazy college kooks.
You've reached Stewie and Brian. We're not here right now.
If this is Mom, send money because we're college students and we need money for books and highlighters and ramen noodles and condoms for sexual relations with our classmates.
All right, fine, you can stay, but what do I tell Lois?
You don't have to tell her. Gary Coleman owed me a favour.
The A-Team is ready to help rid the world of injustice and evil.
I have a right to defend myself as a woman!
I'm sorry. I just came from that orientation seminar about college dating.
Hi, I'm Kelly McGillis, and I'm here to talk to you about rape.
Ladies, look to your left. Now look to your right.
Statistics indicate that both of those men will rape you.
Now, Louie Anderson, our first test is Friday, and if you don't pass you are out of the class.
Don't you worry, sad little girl. The A-Team'll get your beloved kitty down. Ready, boys?
What do you think? I got this at the school store.
It's an MC Escher drawing. I think it's called Crazy Stairs.
Look, Stewie, I gotta finish this assignment or I'm gonna fail this class.
Fine. I'll be out on the quad. You know what I've discovered since I've been in college?
Clearly there is only one person here who understands the material - Brian Griffin.
Here, let me put a smiley face on your test.
You... Do you... Do you want me to just stick it in there?
I've had a bad day. I cheated on that assignment.
You know, I haven't taken a shower since we got here. I totally reek, man. Check this out.
I didn't come back to college to cheat my way through. I wanted to do it on my own.
Mom, look. They're tearing down Roger Williams Park to build a strip mall.
Oh, no, I take Stewie there all the time, don't I, sweetie?
That's where I go to make out with my boyfriend, Darren Mitchellstork.
Well, all right. Make sure you practise safe sex, Meg.
Roger Williams Park? That sounds like ajob for the A-Team.
Ah, Brian, I am glad you could come to my faculty cocktail party.
Dammit, Steve, you forgot to put out the cheese and crackers.
Helen, don't start with me in front of our guests.
Look, sir, I need to confess something. That assignment I turned in...
You know, Brian, before you came along I was so depressed I was planning to kill myself.
If you can learn, maybe one day I can walk.
Dammit, Helen, get the hell off my back or so help me... so help me...
Only way I'll pass is if I cheat. If I do, what was the point of coming back to college?
We can't leave. It's almost half-time, and we all pooped in the tuba.
Hey, what are you guys doing? This is ajob site.
No, it's not. It's Roger Williams Park and we're here to stop you from destroying it.
We'll probably shoot the ground around you to make you scared.
Then you'll jump in your truck, speed off, hit something and do a flip.
No, you'll just roll out and dust yourself off and lumber to your hideout, defeated.
I had a cousin got in a fender-bender at five miles an hour.
Messed his neck up, he's got partial numbness, he's just not the same guy.
Yeah, cos I know this guy who took his car in for an oil change.
Later he got in a wreck and the air bag didn't deploy.
It happens. They call 'em chop shops. Makes it harder to track stolen parts.
Well, you got a lot of work to do. We should get out of your hair.
We were ready to save Roger Williams Park and we got sidetracked by idle conversation.
That's exactly it. We didn't stay focused. I mean, we were right there, and then we just... Somehow we just... I mean... It...
Is it a problem if your penis and your vagina touch?
I try to keep 'em separated, but I woke up this morning and they were sort of together.
I couldn't do it. I thought I'd be able to finish this time, but I just don't have what it takes to be a college graduate.
But you're so close. I mean, your final exam's tomorrow.
You can't give up. You could study tonight. I think if you work at it...
I wonder if Mr Hoover has anything to say about this.
This is not funny. I don't wanna see Mr Hoover.
No thanks, Lois. There's only one person who can help me.
What's the point? I thought I could help people with this A-Team thing, but it turns out I'm as useless as that nude Playboy spread of Debbie Gibson.
Oh, my God, I overslept. My exam's in 20 minutes.
Unless there was some kind of team of people who could get you there in time.
I didn't give up on myself, and I didn't cheat.
Doesn't matter how it turned out. I finished what I started, which means I have my pride, and that's something.
When you take a break from your lipstick, how about taking me to the park?
Stewie, that's not nice. Don't grab Mommy's pants like that. You could really hurt her.
Shame on us, Rupert. How dare we succumb to boredom while she continues to breathe?
She must be destroyed. With Lois out of the way,
I could focus on my life's ambition of taking pictures of Madison County.
Look at what this chick is doing to this polar bear. Wait. Wait. It's...
How come I'm never employee of the month? It's the worstjob since the Sand People choir.
No. The altos were early. This is the worst glee club I've ever...
Relax. They frighten easily, but they'll be back. And in greater numbers.
Thatjerk Opie got employee of the month again because my boss hates me.
Maybe you need to brown-nose her a little bit, Peter.
Really? I thought you said she was ugly. Oh, you mean kiss up to her.
If that doesn't do it, work hard and be polite.
That's how I won friends when I worked for E!.
I asked around and everybody said you liked animals, so I organised a surprise cockfight.
That was probably what all that racket was about an hour ago.
Well, looks like the good Lord just sent me a conversation starter.
Stewie's really been acting out a lot at home and I was just wondering, how's he been behaving at school?
Mrs Griffin, let me show you some pictures he drew in class.
I sure do. His father's not in any of them.
I guess Stewie's been missing his father. Thank you for letting me know.
Damn! She moved. I suppose it's not the first time someone's made a miscalculation.
It seems your son's baseball broke one of my windows the other day.
I could use a strapping young man to do some chores around my house.
That seems fair to me. You have damaged this man's property.
Until you pay off the debt, you'll do whateverjob he wants you to.
At the end of the day, if you're exhausted and your face is wet, it means you did a good job.
Chris, a little hard work can do wonders. Just look at how they built the pyramids.
All peoples must go through hard times. We Jews are getting ours out of the way early.
From hereon out, it's gonna be nothing but smooth sailing.
I don't care what Hollywood imagemakers say. Big women are sexy.
I wanted to tell you Opie will not be receiving employee of the month. He's being promoted.
My wife, Denise. We met in a Christian chat room.
Stewie's been acting out. I think it's cos he's not spending time with you.
It's time you take an interest. Starting today, I want you to spend more time with Stewie.
OK. You can make a box fort. See? Here's a box. You can pretend it's a fort.
Actually, that sounds like fun. I want this. I'm king in here.
There's no better place for a father and son to get to know each other than a ball game.
Hey, remember those hot homeless twins who live under the overpass? Last night...
And this is the hand that caused all the trouble.
Peter, did you take Stewie to a strip club? He smells like sweat and fear.
Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon is not exactly their A squad. I saw bullet wounds.
You can'tjust take him places you want to go. He's a baby.
I think I know how to spend time with my own kid, all right?
Listen, things here aren't working out any more, and I was wondering, can I come live with you and Janet for a while?
Wow, kiddo. You know, I'd love that, but I don't know if now is the best time.
Maybe next year, OK? I'll see you Friday night. Tell your mother I sent the cheque.
All I'm saying is that you just need to find an activity that you and Stewie can share.
What do you think I'm doing? I'm bonding with Stewie.
Well, hello there, young man. I was starting to think you weren't coming.
Sorry I'm late, Mr Herbert. Well, I guess I'll get started.
You know, if you get sweaty and want to take your shirt off, that'd be just fine.
We go live to Ollie Williams in the Channel 5 traffic copter.
Probably cos you're up so high. Coming up, an interview with Andrew Shue.
Peter, when I said bond with Stewie, this is not what I had in mind. I am furious with you.
What's the matter with you, fat man? Stop her. Help me, you fool. You traitor.
Don't feel bad, Peter. Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.
Get out of here, you spineless oaf. And by the way, I faked all those bowel movements.
I feel awful. We were getting along and now he hates me. How do I get him to like me?
That depends. Do you want my advice or are you asking random questions again?
I know you're mad, but when you see where I'm taking you, you'll change your mind.
We just sat on a plane for three hours to come to Florida,
Wow. It looks like Michael Jackson's coming right at me.
We've been puttering around this fat farm for hours. I've had enough.
Oh, my God, he's gone. Has anyone seen my son? Hello?
Hey, it's the crows from Dumbo. Hey, you guys seen my son?
Well, I done seen about everything, but I sure enough ain't seen your boy, nohow.
Well, well. A lost child. Looks like we've got a new recruit.
You must sing. If you don't, they'll make you do a Christmas movie with Tim Allen.
Meg, that's not nice. Old people have a lot to offer society. Just look at Kim Cattrall.
I wanted to thank you properly for all your hard work.
You're free. Run back to your individual countries of origin.
Those multicultural slave children belong to the Disney Corporation. Get 'em, Achmed.
He'll follow Jonathan Dolgen's footsteps with a POD deal at Touchstone. Are you all right?
Fat man, I'm not sure how to say this without sounding cheesy, but, well, you really came through for me today, so I...
Well, Jesse, I guess we've got to find some other way to spend our evenings.
Now back to ESPN's exclusive coverage of the Little League World Series.
Peter, don't forget you have a physical at one o'clock.
For the hundredth time, Lois, I won't forget. Nag, nag, nag.
I should have married that woman I met on my bachelor party.
I can't believe your friends just left you here. Let's get you home.
I should marry you tomorrow instead of that pain in the ass Lois.
I am so gonna cheat on Lois right now. I don't care if she finds out.
You got a condom? Never mind. I got this Milky Way wrapper.
I'm skipping my physical to go have steaks with the guys and I don't want Lois to know.
Um... What the hell, I'll just ask it. Why did we need the horse suit?
Come on, Joe. You haven't even finished one. That guy had two.
I know. I know. I'm terrible. Which is why I'm gonna order the cheesecake.
Full of what? Oestrogen? Come on, take the skirt off, you pansy.
I'll put this in your purse, next to your tampons.
All right, let's start the bidding. Jennifer, how much do you bid on the dinette set?
The doctor said I was too healthy, you know? In too good of shape. Don't even know how.
HÃ¤gar the Horrible, if you keep up that lifestyle of pillaging and turkey legs, you'll be dead in a month.
Well, Mr Griffin, let's take a look at your physical results.
Mr Griffin, you're going to expire in a month. This is your driver's licence, isn't it?
I'm afraid you are going to die when you watch these Dean Martin celebrity roasts.
Mr Griffin, I'm not quite sure how to say this.
You are a Cancer, right? You were born in July? On to these test results.
My son got a D minus on his history test.
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a second. Did you just say I was fat?
This is more awkward than having sex with a rhinoceros who doesn't love you.
If I was fat, could I do this with a Hula Hoop?
No, no, no. I guess you couldn't do that if you were fat.
Careful, Peter. That's an old family photo. My mother gave it to me.
Hey, if I'm fat, then Stewie's fat too because we wear the same size Onesie.
The subscriber you are trying to reach is unavailable or outside the calling area.
This is more exciting than that time I saw Bobby McFerrin fall down those stairs.
They get so doped up on sleeping pills and liquor, an earthquake wouldn't wake them up.
My God. How does she sleep knowing she has to funnel this old duffer's hog?
I do have a brother. My God. I've got to meet him.
Hey, kids of America. It's hand-painted wooden ball in a cup.
Who needs constant electronic video stimulation when there's ball in a cup?
Toss the ball, catch it in the cup, dump it out of the cup, toss it, and catch it in the cup again.
The ball is on a string and attached to the cup so there's no worry if you don't catch the ball.
And cleanup is as easy as catching a ball in a cup.
Why spend another day not catching a ball in a cup when you could be catching a ball in a cup?
Yeah? Well, I challenge you to prove to me that I'm fat.
What the hell? What is this? What is this? Some kind of gag?
Can you believe I'm meeting my long-lost brother? Maybe Dateline will do a story.
I'll get to meet that ass Stone Phillips. He's the kind of guy you hate till he's inside you.
Wait. It's OK because the ball is on a string and attached to the cup.
Mrs Griffin, we don't use the word insane. We prefer the term mentally hilarious.
I can't wait to meet the lunatic. I bet he's weirder than that commercial I saw.
Is it true it has half the calories of butter?
Why do you live in a crazy house, Uncle Patrick?
Well, when I was just a little boy, I had a very traumatic experience.
I was so traumatised they sent me here. I guess they must have forgotten about me.
No brother of mine is gonna be cooped up in some insane asylum.
That's a great idea. He can bring his sling blade and order some French-fried potatoes.
It's great to eat with my family instead of a bunch of chronic masturbators.
Good to meet you. Listen up, everybody. I have something to tell you.
I'm fat. Let me give you a minute to absorb that.
That's the way it is. It's nobody's fault. Meg. But I've decided to do something about it.
I'm gonna help make this a fat man's world by establishing the National Association for the Advancement of Fat People.
This is the best idea I've had since I slayed that dragon.
Well, I want to tell you that Marian and I both appreciate what you've done.
Where are my manners? Marian is my wife. She's sitting right next to me.
Brian, he's been locked up in that place for 30 years.
All right, everyone, I'd like to get started. I'd like to get...
We're start... You know what? Maybe everyone should sit down.
I've prepared an agenda for our organisation, what we want from the community as fat people with pride.
We got a lot accomplished here today. We'll pick this up again tomorrow.
Hey, guys. I'm going for a run. Do me a favour and keep Marian company while I'm gone.
Hey, Brian, Brian. What if I put this cucumber right here?
Put it right there. Do you think Patrick would be angry?
You don't think he'd be ticked off if I put that right there?
We should let it sit here for a couple of weeks and see if it pickles.
If after three weeks it pickles, then she's real and we both have to buy Patrick a steak.
You don't deserve to have sex with me. I'm gonna eat the whore out of you.
Peter, you shouldn't encourage people to be fat. Fat people are immoral.
He was fat and he was bad. One time when I was a boy...
I love Jackie Gleason. Hey, take a look at what I bought at this TV convention.
That set him off like a Paul Shaffer fire alarm.
The hospital said you released Patrick. Have you lost your mind? He's dangerous.
And you should be ashamed of yourself for locking up your own son.
This just in. The body of a local fat man was found murdered in Quahog Park last night.
Police also released this sketch of a female accomplice believed to be his wife.
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker. Quahog's newest serial killer has struck again.
Since the first victim at Quahog Park, three more men have been killed, all of them very very fat.
He's clearly crazy. Look at that imaginary wife of his.
If she's imaginary, how do you explain the pickle on the couch?
The fat-guy strangler lives here and there's a fat guy in the house.
This'll be worse than when Peter did Tara Reid's boob job.
Dropped some pepperoni on there. You know what? That works. Sew it up.
Michael was one of our brothers. He was a good man.
He was a kind man. He was a fat man.
And now he's a dead man. And we're all next. The fat-guy strangler's gonna get us.
People, people. I know what'll make us feel better. Let us sing the NAAFP anthem.
Make yourselves at home. Lois, these are the fat guys. Fat guys, Lois.
My God, look at you fat bastards. I bet none of you can even find your own penis.
Find your penis for a dollar. Find your penis, one dollar. One dollar, find your penis.
Until they find the fat-guy strangler, we will stay here. Victor, don't lean against that.
I know my brother. He couldn't have done these things.
Well, let's see if you feel that way when you see this.
Crap. We lost him. Nothing left to do but finish this sentence uninterrup...
That's for rolling up the window when I tried to jump into the General Lee.
I did mean to kill those fat guys, but I never meant to hurt you.
You may be very sick, Patrick, but I love you.
I have to go back to the hospital, don't I?
Patrick, did you see how that rock hit me in the face? It was like, right in the kisser.
Stop screaming. You can't hear me. Right in the kisser. Right in the kisser.
I was just upstairs and there's a half-dead fat guy eating a dead fat guy.
Yeah. Anything else? Maybe a TV guide and another pillow for your feet?
And try to keep the saltwater out of it if you could.
I'm just saying. You're abusing your powers a little bit.
This is time that could be spent getting me my beverage.
What are you doing? We gotta get ready for your grandpa's 80th birthday.
His folksy racism, his I don't care where I am flatulence.
And the way it seems like he's chewing even when there's no food.
Why don't you come into the dining room? The table's all set for your birthday dinner.
Lois, actually, Dad said he would prefer it if you did notjoin us.
He said it's OK if you sit at the kids' table.
Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go ahead and not complain about this.
And if you could go ahead and sit at the kids' table, that'd be great.
I'm just saying, '70s boobs were different. I don't know.
Dad, tell us about World War I and how America defeated Kaiser Permanente.
Oh, God. Not this again. Francis, why the hell is this always an issue with you?
Because I love this family and I don't want my grandson to burn in hell.
I love you, Grandpa. Your toenails are the same colour as my school bus.
You really think splashing magic water on Stewie will keep him out of hell?
Watch that talk or you'll get your heathen head smacked!
Very Christian. Believe what I say or I'll hurt you.
Hey, I'm gonna eat y'all. I'm gonna eat that hairy leg.
I'm gonna eat that one too. I can see right up them shorts.
I got a whole bunch of rows of teeth to chew you with.
Now, wait a minute. I did have a chubby kid on a raft earlier today.
I am sick of him always trying to force his religious views on us.
I'll talk to him, Lois, but when my dad wants something, it's like sex with Kobe Bryant.
You can kick and scream all you want, but it's gonna happen.
Nothing says eat up like a bleeding half-naked Jew nailed to a piece of wood.
I don't know, ease up on the whole Jesus-ay Christ-ay, if you catch my drift?
Your wife's a Protestant whore and your baby isn't even baptised!
All right, Dad. I don't want you to hate me, so I'll make a deal with you.
If we get Stewie baptised, you and all other old people have to acknowledge and be aware there's crap in the corners of your mouth.
Old people are gross, no matter how cute they try to be on Desperate Housewives.
Go ahead, switch over to ABC for five seconds. I'll wait five seconds.
Oh, my God. Did you see? Did you see how old and ugly they are?
Oh, my God, that redhead looks like somebody poured Silly Putty over their knee.
I'm sorry, Mr Griffin, but I can't baptise little Stewie today.
We'll call you when we get a new shipment in.
There's no such thing as tainted holy water. Come on! We'll do it ourselves.
Stewie Griffin, I baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Oh, my God. This is almost as bad as my bath with Kathy Bates.
Stewie, you don't look so good. Baby, you're burning up.
Mr and Mrs Griffin, I've examined your son and he is suffering from toxic anaemia, which has weakened his immune system.
My God, you mean like John Travolta in that movie?
Oh, no. You're gonna take his face off, like in Face/Off?
Do you know what the best part of this is? Try licking yourself.
He meant The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. How could this have happened?
This is no worse than when I rented out your uterus to those inner-city immigrants.
Of course. You're a grown man. You can pick any religion you want.
Maybe I should pick my own religion. The question is, which one?
I tell you what you can pick - a tune on the piano.
How the whiz-bang does the rest of it go? Quick, make something up.
What are all these women doing in our living room?
Lois, this is Kimmy, the checkout girl from the Korean market.
And Tiffany, the woman who stands downtown and screams at traffic.
Isn't she funny? She's definitely the Kramer of my Mormon wives.
A shipment of tainted holy water could put some local babies in jeopardy.
Sounds dangerous. Be careful next time you're at confession talking about cheating on your wife with that drag queen.
At least you're in no danger, since you only visit church to leave your self-delivered, half-dead newborns on the step.
Coming up, how to turn your unwanted change into folding money.
That's it. Keep laughing. When I get out of here, you're going to get it!
I'll lull you into a false sense of security like those network television announcers.
Tonight on Mama's Family, Mama's got more than she can handle with the in-laws.
A deadly fire could spell death for a honeymoon couple on all new Hotel.
On Newhart, the stockings are stuffed with comedy as Bob plays Santa.
Then a sniper's bullet threatens a partnership on all-new Cagney & Lacey.
Tonight on Night Court, love is in the air when Judge Harry's old school flame comes to town.
Then a child's death could mean the case of Arnie Becker's life on LA Law.
Remember, don't touch Stewie. He's not allowed to have any human contact.
Finish the job, idiot! There's no ventilation! It smells like Brian Dennehy in here!
I see London, I see France, I see Stewie's unsightly chapped ass.
Hi. My name's Peter. I'm a Jehovah's Witness, here to spread the good news of the story of Jesus.
You're the first person who didn't slam the door on me.
He would travel from place to place putting things right that once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap would be the leap home.
The pathway to enlightenment starts with an unfettered, focused mind.
I thought that dot on your head was from a sniper rifle.
Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment. It's a portal, an opening, through which all light, rejuvenation, joy and ecstasy may enter the human form.
Let me out of here! I can't watch another second!
Relax, Stewie. The doctor gave me this so you can get some exercise.
Boy! Stewie's more wound up than Dad was that time he took steroids.
I love how he hits the jukebox to make it work.
Brian, will you carry me upstairs? I want to look at my toys.
Todd, I feel like we'll never have a baby of our own.
Come on, close your eyes. Picture a happy, healthy baby boy at play.
Put him in a magic bubble and release him to the universe.
Honey, now I want you to visualise Lindsay Lohan naked, doing a backwards crab walk.
Dad, I was trying to find my own religion, but it didn't work out.
I haven't been this disappointed since I lost my virginity.
You want to find religion, all you got to do is look in your heart.
Who's always been there for you offering wisdom and truth?
Oh, my God! Dad's right! There is only one person!
I, Peter Griffin, hereby establish the First United Church of the Fonz!
Fonzie, if this be your will, give me a sign.
Hi, I'm Lindsay Lohan. This is how a crab walks.
All right, Dad! Two days ago this was an old barn.
And now, thanks to you, it's an old barn with a sign on it.
All things are possible through the Lord God Arthur Fonzarelli.
I want to thank you guys for making me activity director for the day.
What the hell? What the hell's wrong with this thing?
Peter, it's not a good idea to be putting these flyers all over town.
I'm sorry. That was more than what was called for.
Peter, I know this is important to you. But I don't want to see you humiliated.
I don't think anyone's gonna want to worship the Fonz.
I read your flyer! Finally a religion that makes sense!
There you are. You would not believe the morning I've had.
What is this? I thought you said we were going to church!
This is church. A new church, created by a man brave enough to follow his own vision.
Fonzie's cool, Brian. Deep down, I think we all secretly yearn to be Italian and stupid.
A reading from the letters of Potsie to the Tuscaderos. Yea, and did Fonzie downstairs cometh from his apartment above the garage and sayeth he, 'Reassembleth will I the pieces of my motorcycle though I suffereth from temporary blindness. ' 'And, yea, for I am holy, befriendeth I will Sticks Downy, the only Negro in Wisconsin. '
Well, as soon as I figure out where I am, you're dead, Brian!
Dammit. I haven't been this dizzy since I did those helium whippets at that birthday party.
I have reproductive organs inside of me and I buy groceries.
I never thought you could ever embarrass me more than you did at Cousin Mary's wedding.
If anyone knows of any reason why these two should not be married, let him speak now.
But you said I should look into my heart to find my religion.
It was just a bunch of sheep singing songs and listening to ridiculous tall tales!
Peter's found another way to exploit people's ignorance and that's wrong.
Because all is right when you welcome Fonzie into your life. Fonzie be with you.
I ought to take off my belt and slap the crap out of him!
Look, I don't like you and you don't like me.
I suggest we set aside our differences and work together.
I have an idea to snap Peter out of this.
Sure. Sometimes opposites work well together. Peter taught me that.
Reverend, I gotta talk to you. Last night I had sex with a teenage blonde and her mom.
That's quite a story, but there's no confession so there's really no reason for you to tell me.
Let us pause to reflect on the sacred mystery of Richie's elder brother Chuck, who ascended the stairs with his basketball in season one and never came down again.
There's one problem. When a religion gets too powerful, it's bound to have imitators.
I've just established the Church of George Jefferson. Who wants to move on up?
Hi, I'm Gavin MacLeod and I established the Church of Captain Stubing.
You here to convert people to the Church of Mike Seaver?
People are always looking for the next voice to tell them what to do.
And here I was thinking I was making a difference.
Yeah. Gosh! I guess we do have some common ground here after all, huh?
Yeah. And La Isla Bonita - not a real place. I looked it up, bought a globe, couldn't find it.
No, no... Well, him too. I read somewhere. I think it was in, like, Stuff or so...
No, you know what it was? It was on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.
Yeah. Cos it's not the money, it's about pissing off Daddy.
I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back, and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai are gonna take you down, man!
Listen. Sorry I had to rain on your parade, Peter.
It's all right, Brian. I guess the Church of the Fonz was just a bad idea.
If you managed to inspire even one person to embrace those values, you were a success.
Thanks, Lois. But I doubt there's any chance of that.
Last night I had this crazy dream I was eating a sheep and now my pillow's gone.
Wait. Here it is. What the hell was I eating?
See you, Lois. And like I tell you every day, if I come back in the afternoon and you're having sex with somebody, I'll kill you both. Thanks to effective treatments, Magic Johnson down to one AID.
Oh, God. Did I hit that deaf kid again? They ought to put a bell on that guy.
The nurse says Brian won't be out of surgery for three hours.
I know we're not here to place blame, but I can't help feeling like this is somehow Meg's fault.
If he dies, I'll have to start hanging out with The Rock again.
I think, possibly there's some Filipino in there. Yeah, possibly some Filipino.
If I were 40 years younger, I would plough that till next July.
Today I'm going to show you this fascinating episode of Nova that I taped at home for you.
Of course, nobody here is interested in seeing that. Are they?
Probably not. No. OK. You kind of looked like you were nodding. No? OK.
OK, we should get back to work. Next up, does everyone have a lab partner?
Now open your books to page... I'm sorry. Can I show this video of me doing my wife?
No arguments. I already went through the trouble of borrowing this ramp from Joe.
Don't help me up. I need to retain my independence.
What's wrong, Brian? You've just been sitting on the couch ever since you got back.
The accident got me thinking about life and how suddenly it can be taken away.
You're gonna feel back to normal in no time. Here, have some food.
I have friends now, and some of them very popular.
All those years of you rejecting me finally make sense.
Listen, Sarah. I can't be in your club. I'm not a lesbian.
You can't be serious. We had a whole party planned for you.
Wait, wait! You didn't let me finish. I'm not a lesbian. I'm a super huge mega-lesbian!
Do you have any other friends to invite to your party?
This is going to be great. We'll stay up late, trade stories...
Those are huge! Those are huge boobs. And you know what's nice?
That you don't have that blue vein up there that some of the bigger ones get.
Isn't that a damn good reason to live it up today?
Please welcome the member of the board, Frank Sinatra Jr.
Wow, you actually got to sing with Frank Sinatra Jr?
It was amazing. I got to tell you, he said some things that were exactly what I needed to hear and I was just inspired to get up on that stage. Gotta live life for today, you know.
Brian, don't you think it's a little too early to be hitting the booze?
Why wait? You gotta live life while you can and live it hard.
I feel more exhilarated than Peter did when he swam with the bulls.
Brian, when you wear that suit, it looks like you're taking a white poop. But it stuck.
Lois asked me to baby-sit you, so stay here and be quiet. I'll be back after my first set.
What the hell am I supposed to do to kill time?
Then they can say, I'm not going to pick up those cards.
And they say, Well, what if I just leave them there?
And I say, Those are my father's cards. You can't leave them there. He's gonna be mad.  Where am I?
Whoa, easy, kid. These people paid good money to get in here.
That was sensational. We'll be the biggest thing since Edison and electricity.
How do you think I feel? You get to look at my great house. I look at that dark thing!
No one in my family's taken a bath in a month.
Bite me, man! You seen The Office? Guess you haven't, cos you don't have a TV!
All right, if you don't want it, put it in your napkin. Peter! Put it in your napkin.
Peter! You know, some people would be very happy to have this food.
It's me. And I have something to tell you all.
I don't care what you think. All my lesbian friends accept me and that's all that matters.
You're my daughter. I would accept you if you were gay, blind or retarded, but you're not.
You guys don't care about me and my struggle. I hate you!
I think you're trying to fit in by pretending to be something you're not.
Like the time Peter pretended to be racist to get out ofjury duty.
Brian! There you are. Do you have any idea what time it is?
Stewie was meant to be in bed two hours ago.
Oh, yeah. He's... He was right here, right next to me, like, four hours ago.
Brian, remember me? I'm the guy you left standing at the counter at McDonald's.
It's funny. I tried to walk home. A lot of hungry deer walking around at this hour.
Here's where the story gets fun. You may have noticed I'm missing an ear.
Managed to pull it out of the deer's mouth and put it in some ice I got at a 7-Eleven.
When you're ready to apologise, just talk into this cup.
My ear's in a cup. I guess that doesn't count.
This is cos you've been with that Frank Sinatra Jr.
I am gonna call his mother Mia Farrow and give her a piece of my mind.
You're gonna stop singing at that club. Operator, Mia Farrow.
Don't worry. I don't need to go to the hospital. I'll just use this Mr Potato Head piece.
Brian's going through some heavy stuff right now. He almost died.
I just want to apolo... You know what? Forget it. I don't need this. I'm outta here.
I haven't been so scared since I was mugged by Gene Shalit.
Don't Panic Room. I'm not going to William Hurt you.
So just Pay It Forward and we'll all be Happy Gilmore.
Great. We're checking out naked girls. I am so into girls.
My God, you're as transparent as your father was when he pretended to be a Hassidic Jew to get off work.
Good morning, Hebrews and Shebrews. What a glorious Jewish day.
How about all those coupons in the Sunday paper, huh? Some good deals there.
I went into a store last week and they wanted 800 bucks for a TV, but I ussed them down to 500.
It's not a charade, Mom. I am a lesbian. What do I have to do to prove this to you?
If you don't wanna face the truth, there's nothing I can do about it.
Chris, I'm all out of digital audio tape. Oh, he's gone.
Hello. How come I rich and you not? How come you not sell real estate like I do?
How come I sleep with your wife while you at work then pee in your toilet and don't flush?
And sometimes I open the back part and pee there, so when you flush, pee come out.
You know why? Cos I'm smart. I'm smart, you stupid. Call now.
Who am I kidding? All those buttons, I'll look like Steve Harvey. Brian!
I'll ask the cashier if I can put this up in the window.
Let's see what I'm going to put back. I need the Reynolds Wrap and the bathroom tissue.
I could do without the Triscuits, but they sure are good.
You know what? I'm not going to need the V8 cos I can just get some tomato juice at the mini-mart down the street.
It's a little more expensive, but that's OK. I like to help out a small business.
I hope it's OK if I pay you in pennies.
I was just trying to live for the moment, you know?
Because life can end so abruptly and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
Is that why you've been on this path to self-destruction?
You know, Brian, as smart as you are, you've got to accept that there are some things in life that you just can't control.
You mean the way you can't control the messed-up way that you laugh when you think something's really, really funny?
I don't understand why these cookies are giving us all the fits.
Well, no wonder, Faith. That's not baking powder. It's sneezing powder.
But I already brought a whole batch to the church bake sale.
Yes, I accept that. Your problem is you think that if you're not in control, nothing matters.
That you don't matter. But you know what? You matter to someone.
So get ready cos here it is. My mom was right.
What? So all those rounds of golf we played, those were all lies?
I'm so sorry. For the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged.
And I wanted it to be true, so I pretended to be something I'm not.
That was awful. That was just awful. What do you think, Mark?
I don't know, man. We didn't get the shots we need.
What do you think, Mike? I mean, if you saw action going on in front of you, would you know instinctively to centre it?
I don't know. Can someone take my soda out of the ice box, please, so it doesn't freeze?
What's this I hear about you up all night with a baby and a dog?
All right, all bets are in. Rupert, bad idea trusting the Celtics.
Worse than when I trusted Brian to pack my parachute.
Hey, Brian. Care to place a wager? Tomorrow night on Fox's Celebrity Boxing
You've got Carol Channing the actress beating Mike Tyson the boxer?
Bet! Wait a minute. There's nothing funny about an addiction.
Worse than when I trusted Brian to pack my parachute.
I've got Carol Channing beating Mike Tyson in three rounds.
You've got Carol Channing, the actress, beating Mike Tyson, the boxer.
Well, you're in good company. Betting Freddy took the same wager.
And we're back with Fox Celebrity Boxing with Mike Tyson and Carol Channing.
I tell you, Jim, how Carol Channing outlasted that barrage in the second round we'll never know.
That all you got, you son of a bitch. You're going down, young man.
I ca... I can't believe this. She keeps getting up.
And the winner, by technical knockout, weighing in at 67 pounds,
I don't believe this. I just lost a $50 bet.
Hey, Peter, your 25th high school reunion is next Sunday.
Have the money by tomorrow and there won't be any problems.
I'm just saying it would probably be better for everybody if you had the money tomorrow.
Hey, Peter, I was going through your garbage and I noticed your high school reunion is coming up.
I noticed Lois clipping her toenails and I thought: Oh, man, I gotta get in on that.
Everybody's all got their nice cars and their big, important jobs, and their fancy hats, and their fresh strawberries so big you can eat them like a hand fruit.
Peter, everyone lies at those things. Just tell them you're a big shot.
Boy, imagine what it would be like to be a big shot.
Oh, I... You know what? Just give me till next Friday, I'll have it for.
Oh, that's funny. I could have sworn I said, have it today.
You gonna give me my money? Where's my money, man?
You've got till 5:00, you hear me? You got till 5:00.
Peter, this is ridiculous. Why can't you just be yourself?
Lois, just go along with it. Act like I'm a big shot.
Oh man, I got to tell you, you kick ass, man.
In fact, I was just saying that the other day, to all the guys down at the brewery.
Peter, I know you're humiliated, but getting drunk is not the answer.
Uh-oh. Either my esophagus just got shorter, or I'm about to throw up.
I've never a seen a guy your size who could move like that.
How would you like to play for the New England Patriots?
Say, listen, uh, Tom, could you get me a towel? I threw up on the floor.
Our top story tonight, we go live to terrific haircut Bob Costas, as he talks with local man Peter Griffin, who is living his dream of playing for the New England Patriots. Bob?
I'm standing here with Tom Brady and his newest teammate, Peter Griffin.
Hey, Ma! Check it out! I'm married to a pro athlete!
I think he's gonna make a great addition to a great team.
Uh, 'cause it's not really up to me, it's up to him.
Uh, you know, 'cause that's, uh, that's why God's there.
He's, uh... he's minding the fence, making sure that guy never comes back.
You know, if it weren't for the Devil, God'd probably go insane, blow his brains out from boredom, you know?
Boy, Lois, I can't believe this is happening to me.
I- I don't have to lie to people about my life anymore.
All right, I'm ready. Come on, good game. Good game, everybody. Yeah.
Come on, good game. Let's get out there. Let's do it.
Yeah, you got money to pay for fake moustaches, huh?
Yeah. Yeah. How-How much you pay for that fake moustache?
Don't make a fool out of me. I want my money.
Well, I got to tell you, this was a delicious dinner, Mrs. Griffin.
No, it's okay. It's just a little spot. It'll come out.
Well, that's not gonna come out. You better take a shower.
I say, what the devil is all the fuss about? I don't get it.
We're just a couple of guys messing around. That's what we are.
I'm here to kick off the Touchdown of Savings Weekend, at Wilkins Hyundai and Subaru.
We will blitz the competition, and in no time, you'll be driving your new Hyundai or Subaru right to a touchdown.
I don't know, Chris. And I'm starting to get worried.
I think all this success might be going to his head.
Do you know he spent $30,000 on a wax sculpture, of Harriet Tubman doing Gwyneth Paltrow?
Where the hell is Griffin? It's almost time for kickoff.
What do you think, huh? I got this for doing that car dealership ad.
All right, enough messing around, huh? Let's play this game.
Relax, Tom, I'm just having a little fun. I got it under control.
Okay, 28-Z right, pitch left, on one, on one. Ready? Break!
Huh, there might be some hope for this guy after all.
Now, a woman who'll kiss on the very first date is usually a hussy.
And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out Is anything but fussy
But a woman who'll wait till the third time around
She's the girl he's glad he's found. She's his Shipoopi
She will never get sore if you beg her pardon
She will never get sore on the way to supper
Now little old Sal was a no-gal. As anyone could see
Look at her now, she's a go-gal. Who only goes for me
She will never get sore on the way to supper
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, do, si, do.
I talked to the coach and he's selling your contract to another team.
And the only one that'll take you, is the worst football team in Europe:
I've got my money, your wounds have healed up nicely.
What do you say we let bygones be bygones, hmm?
You shot me in both my knees then lit me on fire.
I tell you what, you get one free revenge shot at me.
Isn't there any way the Patriots could let you back on the team?
It's all right, Lois, I can make the best of this.
I mean, a British football team can't be that bad.
Well, I guess living in a London flat isn't gonna be too bad, huh?
Second, there's no water in it, because everybody here just uses Elizabeth Hurley.
All right, well, where is she? 'Cause I need her now!
Look, Peter, I know you're upset because you blew your opportunity with the Patriots but...
Now I bet if you really tried, you could turn that team around.
When you were talking about that sale at T.J. Maxx just now,
And we'll challenge the Patriots to a game, and we'll kick their ass!
You keep calling here and threatening me, I'm gonna notify the police.
I'm calling to challenge you to a grudge match between the Patriots and the London Silly Nannies.
What kind of suit you want to be buried in?
If we're gonna beat the New England Patriots next week,
So you're gonna get in shape the way American athletes do:
I say, Jenkins, you give me that dirty look one more time, and I've a good mind to get into my PJ's and have a pillow fight with you.
Just tell me when it's gonna come! Just do something, anything!
Oh. Hey, Brady. You gonna gloat and call me a loser now?
For one guy to stand up to the entire New England Patriots team, that's a winner in my book.
I- I just don't think I have it in me.
All right, Peter, you made it to the Bonus Round. Congratulations.
The category is Actor & Show.  So... we need five consonants and a vowel.
Uh, okay. Um. Z, four, Q, another Q, uh... a third Q and a Batman symbol.
Okay, no help there. Um... take a shot at it. Talk it out.
Oh, my God! I just took a shot in the dark! Holy crap!
Why don't you go ahead and pick out some prizes from our showcase?
All right, I'll take the ceramic Dalmatian for $600 and, uh...
Give me the one free week of maid service and, uh, I'll take the hat rack.
Hey, how much for that fat guy in the circle? I don't see a price tag on that.
Okay, well, in that case, I'll take the rest on a gift certificate.
But I suppose it's not the strangest thing I've seen on a game show.
All right, players, the answer once again is: It was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of Mars.
Only saying his name backwards can send him back to the fifth dimension where he belongs.
All right, whip'em out, woman. It's time for the afternoon meal.
And by the way, let's be clear. I only like you as a friend.
Hi, I'm Joan. I'm, uh, your maid for the week.
This is going to kick more ass than that magical ride I took.
It's the great space coaster get on board on the great space coaster
We'll explore. Come and ride a fantasy to a place where dreams fly fast and free
Unless the next words out of your mouth are directions how to get back to the fish skeleton, I'm going to punch you right in the stomach.
No one's cleaned my belly button in a long time.
Lois is afraid to go near there and my fingers are too thick.
Hey, hey, Lois, wants me to go to the store, and the car's low on gas.
Peter Griffin, a once-great champion of the motor speedway now a study in moppishness.
And I told you boys to pick up your clothes and who left the wet towel on the bed?!
I swear to God, sometimes I feel like just going on strike!
What would you all do if went on strike, huh?!
You know what?! That's what I'm going to do! I'm going to go on strike, and you can all try living without me! What do you think about that, huh?!
That's what I'm going to do! I'm going to do that! I'm going to go on strike!
I was breast-feeding Stewie and he bit me again. I think he might have even broken the skin.
I see. Um... maybe I should, uh, you know, uh, look at it. Uh...
You see, the areola is very tender here, and I think one of his new teeth may have bitten down right on the duct.
Breast'feeding's just so painful since Stewie's teeth are coming in.
Now I know how Alec Baldwin feels when he feeds his brothers.
You know what? I'll give it a try. Thanks, Brian.
Uh... any, any other problems you have, too, like, for example, around your underpants... that you want me to take a look at, I could, I could take a look at that, too.
All right, boys, it's my maid's last night, so we got to make the most of it.
I filled this watermelon with chocolate pudding and M-80 firecrackers.
Uh, uh, hey, there. I mean, it's nice to pleasure your acquaintance.
I mean, uh, would you like to go out to dinner tomorrow night?
No, honey, no, no. Tonight we're going to have formula instead.
That's more disgusting than when Peter went through that Daisy Duke's phase.
So who's up for some hoops at the park, huh?
Now I know it's different than you're used to, but you'll see. It's just as good.
Yes, that's what we were promised about Jim Belushi some 25 laugh-free years ago.
Well, this is our three-week anniversary, Joan. I wanted this date to be special.
You know this place is unique because if you're lucky, some nights around sunset, the screaming black dolphins come out.
I'm going to see how long I can hold my breath.
Joan... I've decided I want to spend my life with you.
Nothing would make me happier than to be Mrs. Quagmire.
Hey, man, I see you got some seaweed on your tail.
Man, you all... Oh! I thought you were talking about the other seaweed.
No, no, I know Quagmire and I'm telling you, this has got to be some kind of prank.
You know, like that prank I pulled on Ashton Kutcher.
Giving up breast milk is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I'll bet the Founding Fathers had an easier time writing the Bill of Rights.
You think the language in the Second Amendment is clear enough?
Of course it's clear. Every American has the right to hang a pair of bear arms on their wall. How could that possibly be misconstrued?
Wait. You know what? Before we send this to the printer, let's take that abortion thing out.
Boy, I never thought we'd be going to Quagmire's for an engagement party.
I'm telling you guys, he's putting us on. He's the same old Quagmire.
I'm just joshing. Of course we're expecting you. Come on in, friends.
You all just take your shoes off, there. Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing.
I have to go. I have, uh... terrible foot odor.
I feel like I can touch things in here now.
So, Joan and I just love Without a Trace, don't we, honey?
Ooh, hate is a word we don't use in this house.
Joan and I always say, if you don't have anything nice to say about someone don't say anything at all. We say that, right, honey?
These people have put an old-fashioned Colonial spinning wheel in the center of their living room.
No, guys, I can't do that. It's degrading to women.
I'm married, Cleveland's got foot odor, and Joe's dead from the waist down.
And they've gotten so engorged from the weaning, I've gone up two bra sizes.
Well, what can we do about it? The wedding's tomorrow.
Gosh, Peter, thanks so much for being my best man.
I know you've got a foot fetish so I got you this Statue of Liberty's foot.
Oh, thanks, Peter, but Joan's all the foot I need now.
But, Quagmire, that's the real foot from the Statue of...
Hey. Do you have any idea what I went through to get this?
You think this is just: Oh, here comes Peter with the Statue of Liberty's foot? Oh, isn't that a gas? No, no. The reality, the real reality of getting this together was staggering.
This cost me $437,000. Don't ask me how I got it.
I had to call in a whole bunch of favors from people I've never even met.
So the very least you can do is just rub up against... I don't know.
No. No, no, no. Take... just get it out of here.
You don't know what happens to a man when he gets married.
It's like a disease that rots you from the inside out.
It's easy, Quagmire. Just tell her to hit the bricks.
No, I only said that so you'd giggoogety my gashmoigin.
So, anyway, what I'm trying to tell you is, uh... some of the guys thought we should get a divorce.
B- b-b-b-but I, I told them they didn't know what they were talking about.
'Cause if you ever left me, I'd have to cut myself. and then... I'd cut you.
I love you, too, insane woman I'm having second thoughts about.
Dear God, I've got to get a hold of myself.
Look at me, sucking pilfered milk off a dirty carpet.
I'm as pathetic as the fat man when he tries to read.
Oh, hey, Lois. Did you know that Evel Knievel was born in Montana?
Wait a second. We know she's gonna be upset if you dump her, but if something happened that was out of your control...
This may be the most absolutely perfect fake death in the history of fake deaths.
You mind if we come in? There's, um... there's been an accident.
This is, uh, not going to be easy, but, um, it's something you should see.
So, anyway, here's Quagmire walking through the park minding his own business. I just happened to be there with my video camera, when a ninja shows up!
I imagine you're probably wondering what happened to the body.
I wish it were, Joan. I wish it were a joke.
You go for a walk in the park one day and wheel chair ninjas and Nazis and pots-and-pans robots show up to kill you and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.
You know what'll prove it? When people die, they void their bowels.
Through sheer force of will, I kicked my addiction to breast milk.
I just had to find a way to make breasts seem repulsive.
Well, Brian, I thought I was ready to wean him, but I just miss the bonding.
No. No! No, put me down! I beg of you!
Sorry I'm late. I had a meeting over at NBC about Joey.
Says here your buddy Quagmire died of a heart attack.
I gotta tell you, I always thought it'd be rectal trauma.
Well, Mayor West is afraid of zombies, so the city says all caskets must been cased in concrete.
Sorry, Mr. Quagmire, but I still need a body to take back with me, so...
This is probably not cool. Just throwing it out there.
I'm not gonna kill her. I'm just gonna watch her die on her own.
Can you leave that body here for another five minutes?
Chris, I know when you're lying to me, just like Santa Claus knows when you're sleeping.
For my science homework, I had to make a shoebox diarrhea of the evolution of man.
Hey, Lois, I got your pregnancy test. What the hell you need this for?
I need it because I think I might be pregnant.
I didn't think the fat man still had that kind of marksmanship.
Wait a minute. That guy on the grassy knoll's got a gun.
Okay, one more minute, and then if there are two pink lines...
Oh, God, I hope you're not pregnant. We can't afford another kid.
Bobby, Jan, Mike Seaver, Carol Seaver, Boner, Urkel, Mr. Furley...
Peter, those aren't your kids. That's the Nick At Nite lineup.
I'm a paladin with 18 charisma and 97 hit points.
I can use my helm of disintegration, and do One-D-Four damage as my half-elf mage wields his plus five holy avenger.
Although, I got to tell you, I was, uh, kind of getting used to the idea of having a little brother or sister.
Why should I get my tubes tied? You should get a vasectomy.
First of all, I don't know what that is, and second of all, no freaking way.
Peter, it's the male equivalent of a woman getting her tube's tied, except it's actually a lot quicker and safer.
Well, I'm starting to get the picture, but how's it done?
You know, the one who always has high beams under her ribbed white cotton T-shirt
But then stares dagger sat you for checking her out
And it's like why do you wear that if you don't want attention?
Because of the sexual harassment meeting you all had to go to
And you couldn't help but notice that the female lawyer running the seminar had a huge rack
Like, ridiculously huge for someone who has to talk about that kind of stuff
Well, I guess that's the definition of the word irony
That's right. You take the venom out of a cobra, and what have you got?
A bunch of the guys on the force have had vasectomies, and their lives haven't changed at all.
Well, yeah, but what if me and Lois do end up wanting another baby? It'll be too late.
You could freeze some of your sperm at the sperm bank just in case.
I don't know, Cleveland. It didn't work out so great that time I froze my nuts.
If I can get some guys, you want to play Red Rover?
Anyone else want to feel my Weebok in their grapes?
Yes, that's right, cry. Cry like Sauron when he lost his contact lens.
It might be stuck to a tree or a rock.
I've, uh, got an appointment to, uh, banish a white Russian from my Kremlin.
Well, we don't have empty rooms right now, but if you'll have a seat...
Yeah. Uh, I kind of, uh, warmed myself up in the car, if you catch my drift.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Hi. My partner and I want to have a baby.
We'd like a vial of sperm and an applicator that looks like Jody Foster's knuckles.
Mr. Griffin, you were in there an awfully long time.
And, uh, just so you know, everything in there is exactly the way it was when I went in.
There is absolutely zero chance that I spilled all the jars and had to refill them with my own sperm.
We now return to Tony Danza and Sylvester Stallone in...
Ah, I just don't feel like it, Lois, seeing as how I'm not a real man anymore.
It's no reason to give up on your sex life.
I don't know, Lois. I'm just not feeling it anymore.
You know, I'd love to stay and eat with you, but,
I got to go meet Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire down at the bar, so, uh, just put my dinner in the fridge, and I'll heat it up later.
You, clear the slide. I'm going down in five minutes.
Good God, running an empire is harder than finding diversity in the Abercrombie & Fitchcatalogue.
How the deuce did you get out of Peter's testicles?
Well, I don't mean to be a discourteous host, but this is my playground.
Very well, then. You leave me no choice but to declare war.
So be it. I'll do to you what B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis.
I'm just gonna grab something, too, and go back to bed.
You know, Lois has gotten kind of fat since you guys stopped having sex.
It might be time to, uh... you know... have some sex.
You know, at first, I didn't want to do it 'cause of the vasectomy, but now it's just...
You know, that little wrinkle that fat people get on their elbows that looks like a schwa?
I mean, you wouldn't have sex with her, would you?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I would do everything to her. I don't care what she looks like.
Sorry, fat wife coming through. Sorry, sorry, excuse me, fat wife.
Not as embarrassed as I was when I got that job entertaining prison inmates.
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're, like... it's better than yours, damn right, it's better than yours I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.
Look, honey, with all due respect, you've gained some weight recently.
It's five pounds at the most. It's not a big deal.
You start with five pounds, and then one day, boom, you wake up, and you're on The Practice with sixteen rings in your ear.
Now, if you'll excuse me i have to go warn the chef that you've arrived.
The only reason I'm eating anyway is because i hate him.
We're going to launch a massive air strike against Bertram and his army.
It's quite simple, actually. You press the smiling duck to take off, the cow with the bow tie to fire weapons, and the clown face is just a clown face, enjoy it.
Even till now we've been fighting Bertram on his terms.
We've got to fight him over there by the swing set, so we don't have to fight him here at the sandbox.
Whew. It's a good thing, too, because I really didn't have an exit strategy.
Damn you, Bertram, I thought we called no biological warfare!
Come on, we got to get you out of here.
A couple more oatmeal baths and you'll be all better.
You'll probably just slice a couple of bananas in here and chow down, huh, porky?
He won this round, Brian, but I'm going back tomorrow.
And when I've carried out my plan, he won't know what hit him.
Well, kids, just when I thought we'd never find and assistant coach,
I ran into this drifter hanging out near the elementary school playground.
He's got a clown costume in his trunk, so we know he's good with kids, and pictures of boys in their underwear, so he's probably had some medical training.
Well, I'm going to take off while he fits you for cups in that windowless supply shed.
This Friday on TNT, the world premiere of Morgan Freeman in
Ever since I was a little boy, people have enjoyed the sound of my voice, and I figured you either get busy talkin' or you get busy dyin'.
Why, even right now, I'm just sitting in a chair sipping some tea and reading from a script.
The wall is covered with something that resembles egg crates, except they're soft and spongy, like a Twinkie... like a Twinkie.
Oh, hey, Hogzilla, you happen to see my hot wife, Lois, around?
No, I haven't. Maybe she's out looking for a man who can satisfy her.
Do me a favor when you go to sleep, aim your butt the other way.
I felt like somebody was sticking me with a cigarette lighter from the car.
Uh, let's check. Uh, just, lift up that fold right there.
There were so many boobs, I didn't know whose boobs I was grabbing, your boobs or my boobs.
Much better than that night you pretended your penis was Danny Aiello.
With Stewart out of the picture, this whole playground is under my control.
Yes, Bertram, I'm alive, and I think you'll find all your guards quite incapacitated.
You have an annoying habit of turning up where you're not welcome.
Well, when I'm done with you, you're going to hate me more that the other vowels hate Y.
If you'll turn to page 34 of your blue books, you'll see our projections for next quarter,
You know what? I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back.
This can be a pain in the ass when you got to do it all by yourself.
Yeah, you're telling me. All right, go ahead and drop it in.
Oh, boy, that's going to be beautiful when it reaches adulthood.
So what happened with that kid you were telling me about?
Oh, Lois, I have no idea if we're doing it of if that's just the back of your knee, but either way it feels so good.
We should get you to the hospital. All right, hold-hold on a sec...
Well, it was a tough job removing all that fat to get to your heart, Mrs Griffin, but you came through it beautifully.
Honey, I'm sorry I tried to make you into something you're not.
Although, I gotta admit, I'm gonna miss eating cereal out of the dimples on your ass.
Well, Mrs. Griffin, you rest up for a few days and you'll be just fine.
I realize now that eating is not the way to solve my problems.
Hey, Doc, what did you do with my Mom's fat?
My God, what did those drug dealers do to you?
Oh, they took my chest out and threw it over there.
Then they pulled my legs out and threw them over there.
I spent all morning watching a VH1 special on Gwen Stefani.
I don't know what a Hollaback Girl is, all I know is I want her dead.
You know, you've been laying around the house a lot lately.
Why don't you get a part-time job like Peter used to have?
Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done.
I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run, I gotta run.
I wear paper hats. Would you like an apple pie with that?
I just found out I got that internship at Mayor West's office.
Yeah, it was a really tough interview, but I totally nailed it.
All right, Meg, we're going to start with a little word association.
I'll say a word and you say whatever comes into your head.
Hey, Meg, if you're working for the mayor, you know what that means?
I flushed a diaper and it's a mess up there.
I mean, it's time I went out and got a job, for God's sakes, I'm seven years old.
Seven? That's not bad. You know, Todd was 15 when he died.
Oh, you're not taking me to the vet, are you?
I'm a little worried that you're going to have me put down.
I know there's been some concern about my sphincter's low shutter speed.
This set of wheels is even better than those talking cars on that commercial.
I couldn't help but notice you across the parking lot and, uh... you know, you're very attractive and, uh...
You want to go behind the Applebee's and do it?
Huh? You want to just go have some dirty, stupid, insane parking lot sex?
You know what I would've done to you back there? Why didn't you say something earlier?
What the hell is wrong with you, Peter?! You could've killed me!
Yeah, but I got you good, Lois. Admit it. Just say it, I got you.
Oh, we got into a little accident. It's all right.
Well, I guess accidents happen when you least expect them.
Oh, look, you got the community events corkboard wedged in your grill.
Don't y'all forget to sign up for the Quahog community talent show.
Except for that time we went to see Phantom of the Opera.
Let's see the gross half of your face so I can get out of here.
Oh, your old guitar. I haven't seen that thing in ages.
Well, Lois, I thought you and me could do a song for the talent show.
It could be just like the old days when we used to play.
We want to talk to you about a friend of ours. He's not here tonight.
Uh, this is a song about that man and his world that was taken from him.
You Indians were so awesome in oh, so many ways
The only cause of death Was drifting off to sleep
And they left this piece of wisdom That we hope you all will keep
You know, it would be fun to write some new songs.
Yeah, I'll pick some up at the end of my shift.
I should really pick up that milk now before I forget.
Hey, Brian, you see that magazine cover right there? See who's on it?
I just wanted you to know a little bit about who I am.
My God, this is a bigger rip-off than Peter's Sounds of the Rainforest CD.
Once they're gone, this'll be a great place to raise cheap beef.
Yeah, yeah! Hey, what's that song he does that I hate?
Meg, I'm going to lunch now and I'm having pizza.
So if you see the Noid running around, tell him if he ruins my pizza's freshness,
Hey, Meg, I need to see the mayor about this $400 parking ticket.
Brian, you can't just barge in here. You have to make an appointment.
Adam can charge whatever he wants for a parking ticket.
You know, Meg, that guy's been playing fast and loose with his position for years now, and I've had it. He's a corrupt bastard.
Somebody's got to stand up and prove to this town that he's a crook.
It took me two hours to spell hat with these things.
I finally got the T right-side-up, and then you come in here...
I'm going to expose Mayor West as the corrupt politician that he is.
I'm on my way to meet a source who won't talk to me over the phone.
You'll understand if I don't come out from the shadows.
My identity will be safest if you never see my face.
Somebody talked! No one is safe! I'm getting out of here!
They should make a tube that sends you right to work
Hey, now, Peter, you gotta remember that when we used to write the old songs, we had a lot of inspiration, huh?
You know, I think Brian may have some inspiration in a cigar box under his bed.
Eh, I don't know, Lois. I don't think this is gonna work.
That's, that's my favorite picture of Brian, over there on that wall.
What are you doing here, Brian? Still trying to smear my boss?
No, no, no, I actually came to my senses, and realized I was out of line. Uh, I'm just here to apologize.
Hey, can you guys hold on a sec? I gotta get this to Helen in Accounting.
Oh, God, I feel more delirious than my cousin, Stewie Cruise.
I'm in love with Katie Holmes! I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
Go see my new movie! I'm in love with Katie Holmes!
All we need is one incriminating entry in this date book, and that's our ticket to...
Well, uh, you two are busy being nude. So, uh... we'll just, uh, head out and, uh... let you be nude.
Well, this is the last entry in the date book. Super secret meeting at motel. Inform no one.
I saw this report on TV about how filthy hotel rooms are.
In a moment, we will use the special lights to see just how filthy this seemingly clean hotel room really is.
The only thing this guy is guilty of is being a whack-job.
The mayor is dating a teenage intern, and it's Meg.
I thought you were supposed to get the suit and the top hat.
I really have a great time when I'm with you.
Hey, listen. Freakin' shot in the dark. You wanna do something sometime?
Oh, my God, I have a great idea. Let's make cookies!
We don't have to, Lois. Look... there's a magical land of desserts right behind you.
You realize he probably does this with every new intern.
I am going to the press with this story, and when it hits, it'll be bigger than Uncle Sam's nipples.
Maybe we can just all relax and enjoy the sauna.
My dog is gonna expose our relationship to the press.
You and I know that we haven't done anything wrong.
I told you that I'd wait for you until you're 18 or 21.
Or maybe 25, when you can legally rent a car.
Well, Meg, I'm a public figure. I'm used to the tabloids' doodie.
You're just a sweet young lady with her whole life ahead of her.
This story could ruin your future, and I can't let that happen.
I got so caught up in taking down Mayor West, that I just lost sight of right and wrong.
Well, can I give you a lift home? My cab's right outside.
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons, and I'd like to welcome you to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.
Let's have a round of applause for our first performer.
Uh... Star Jones got married. That was in the news.
Uh, married a black fella, which is quite a surprise because I'd call her quite a catch, and black guys, by and large, they're not so helpful on a fishing vessel.
I even had a couple of Japanese guys who worked out great.
He'd do her all the way Even call her the next day
Well, Dad, I think I can shed a little light on that.
You guys were so baked, you didn't sound anywhere near as good as you thought you did.
Well, that's a popular misconception, Mom and Dad, but the fact is, the chief ingredient in marijuana is THC, a mild form of acid, prolonged usage of which can cause adverse effects to your sexual potency, short-term memory loss and can also severely damage your brain tissue central nervous system and basic motor skills.
To put it simply, Mom and Dad, there's a reason that they call it dope.
So my advice to the two of you would be...
Family-owned, great hours, and lots of parking in the rear.
Nah, it's pretty clean. Carol Burnett works part-time as a janitor.
You know, when she tugged her ear at the end of that show, she was really saying good-night to her mom.
I wonder what she tugged to say good night to her dad?
Oh, that's the exit. 'Course, in this place, every exit's also an entrance.
I always try and find the hottest chick in the place
I crack her on the noggin with a lamp or a vase
And then when she's unconscious I do stuff to her face
Mom! You know I go to the mall on Saturdays.
Hey, what time is it? We're gonna miss the movie!
That's the first time I've seen you reading something that didn't later turn out to just be a sandwich.
Eh, it's an erotic book. I bought it at that sex shop.
I got to tell you, I've read 4 chapters of this, and it's not sexy at all. Much Ado About Humping.  Well, sounds sexy.
Yeah, if only this were smut, Lois. He rubbed her shoulder sensually.
What the hell is that? That's not sexy. You can't do somebody in the shoulder.
Hey, guys, tell me if this letter sounds all right. Dear Reek Publishing, I was highly disappointed by your erotic novel. Here's what I would've wrote: It was past midnight when the blonde, smokin'- hot lab assistant who looked a little like Heather Locklear, only with bigger jugs, was grabbed and thrown on to the lab table. He ripped off her lab coat, and she grabbed his metallic extension. Oh, did I mention he was a robot? Cause that's kind of important. Yeah, a robot. Awesome.
Whoa! That is hot! I got to get a copy of that.
I'm no school administrator, but there's an extension program going on in my trousers. And then Captain Leroy Hot Dog' Zanzibar and Gina from my work got in the backseat of his really cool spaceship. Gina was finally wearing that tank top I got her and nothing else. Zanzibar knew he couldn't control his space horniness any longer, and then they totally did it. And if I'd have been there, I would've been, like, Ah, sweet.
I felt like I was right there on planet Niptune.
You're not the only one. Everyone down at the bar wanted a copy.
Hey, if you ask daddy, he might even give you some money to do it yourself.
That's a great idea, Lois! I'll talk to him tomorrow.
If this works out, I could make more money than when I had that rat farm in the basement.
We are trying, Senor Griffin, but the land, she gives us nothing. There is no sunlight.
The spectators hold their breath as Stewie Griffin is America's last hope... to take home the gold.
I sure did, Cathy that was impressive. Here comes the dismount.
I'm training for the Olympics, and I need absolute concentration!
Oh, my God, that was even cooler than playing with the speech function on my Macintosh.
Listen, uh, Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're a businessman, I'm a businessman, and I've got a proposal that I guarantee you can't refuse.
See, I wrote this erotica book, and I was hoping you could loan me $7 billion to publish it.
It's at the bottom of this jar of barbed wire and salt.
Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt gave me five dollars for these Xeroxes, and I haven't looked back.
Hi. Would you be offended if I told you your prose suggests a male-working class version of Emily Bronte?
Would you be offended if I said I'd like to use your ass as a bongo drum?
I'm Betty White reading The Hot Chick Who Was Italian, or Maybe Some Kind of Spanish, by Peter Griffin.
Chapter One. Oh, God, you should've seen this one hot chick. She was totally Italian. Or maybe some kind of Spanish.
Wow! You know, from the other side, that's kind of annoying.
Well, it's not real fur. It's actually made from bald eagle, and it's weather-treated with a mixture of whale skin oil and children's tears.
You're liable as publisher. I'm here to cease your assets.
Well, Mr. Greenberg i'd like to see you try to cease my assets after battling the Rancor.
I lost my home, my money, and, perhaps just as serious, my wife left me!
Look, you can stay with us if you want, you filthy hobo.
You shouldn't be embarrased about mooching off your kids at age 70.
All you've done his hole life is treat him like crap.
Now he's offering to help you. The least you can do is be grateful.
You know, a lot of people died in the tsunami.
And i'll be here to entertain you and love my life for many, many years to come.
Oh, yeah. Couldn't figure that one out. You've still a guy for that.
Mom, I can't believe you came out of that belly.
Daddy, I never thought you'd be so lost without your money.
You right, Lois. Who the hell am I kidding? I can't live like this.
Maybe there's something you can do to help cheer him up.
I am going to teach your father how to be a regular guy.
Like when we were cartoon sketches on the Tracy Ullman Show.
Hey, Lois, what do you say we go downtown and buy a dog?
It's gonna be quite a different place with him gone, that's for true.
All right, Cathy, it looks like Stewie Griffin is preparing to begin the floor routine.
That's right, Mitch, and as we watch Griffin doing this,
I want to remind everyone that this is absolutely not gay.
No, no. Didn't you just hear the announcers? They said it's not gay.
Listen, I know you're upset about losing your money, so I wanted to show you it's not so bad living like a regular guy.
People ride it to get places that they need to go.
I don't take the lawn with me when I go.
Well, I was right to trust you with it, then.
Now, this is called waiting in line at the movies.
Trust me, it makes it that much more special when we finally get inside and see Renee Zellweger doing her whole scrunch-face routine.
You know, Peter, what you showed me today was just awful.
I really don't see what's so great about being a regular person.
The bus smells like crap, the movie theater is sticky, and Renee Zellweger should only be the cute friend at best.
You know, I never thought about it till now, but... maybe being a regular person does suck.
My God, is this what my whole life is destined to be?
Carter, somehow you and me are going to find a way to get rich.
I just got a subpoena regarding an erotic novel, and I'm looking for the son of a bitch responsible.
All right, Peter, how are we going to do this? How are we going to get rich?
Well, I say we start out small, Carter. Here's my plan.
I'll distract Lois while you steal money from her purse.
Lois, look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
And it cost me $900 for the six weeks of unicycle lessons.
But you've got to spend money to make money, champ. Moving on.
Hey, Meg, uh, we're trying to make some money and, um... would you like to buy some pot from your granddaddy and me?
All I know is, there's a lot of money to be made in these stupid teen dramas they keep putting on TV.
I don't want to wait for my lunch to get colder
I want the car that's got a lot of gas
Dawson, I'm just not ready to give up my virginity.
I promised myself that I'd save it for the man that I marry.
Come on, you saw me on that boat. I was wearing a blazer.
I don't want to, all right? I don't want to right now.
I told you, I'm not comfortable. I think you could respect that, you know.
I don't want to do this anymore, all right? You know what? You went too far.
You know what? It's just weird, man. It's just weird.
You can't vault inside the living room. You're going to get hurt.
Yeah, I'll get hurt right on to a Wheaties box.
Which means you can't see the colors of the American flag.
Do I take it out or do I leave it in?
Oh, we haven't had a paying customer in months. Nobody rides the train anymore.
I'll probably just cancel it before you can use it, so...
I got to pay for that. That comes out of my paycheck... if you take it.
Well, I can't in all good conscience take that, then.
All right, well, uh, can you stop this thing, so we can get off?
Uh, no. I mean, I'd love to, but it stops at the pre-designated stops.
Well, for this, this is a first-class cabin, it's 25 bucks.
You know what, that's fine. Just give me two coach tickets.
Oh, wow, when did Mama Mia! come to the Oakdale?
Oh, yeah, what, uh, just a week ago, I think.
Oh, well, we should go. Do you want to go see Mama Mia!?
Peter, could I speak to you over by the door?
I give up. We're going to be lower-middle class Americans forever.
When you're rich, you don't own your possessions, your possessions own you.
Ten years ago Daddy offered to give us $10 million, and I turned it down.
Yes. And I'll always turn it down, because money just complicates everything.
Happiness isn't about buying expensive things, it's about being together.
It's not about taking expensive trips, it's about holding each other during a thunderstorm.
Oh, Brian, we're so thrilled your gay cousin Jasper finally decided to come visit.
Well, we do have... we got Total, and we got some raisins. I mean, you could, like, mix those together. It'd be... it'd be kinda like Raisin Bran.
It'd be like Raisin Bran, but it's not Raisin Bran.
Hey, bud, take a break. I'll take over. Go smoke a fatty.
This is Sierra Tango 817, Matthew McConaughey's private jet, requesting permission to land.
Oh, sorry, Sierra Tango 817. All our runways are filled.
But it looks empty from up here. We're almost out of fuel.
No, no. No room at all. But, lucky for you, there's a big new airport out in the middle of the ocean.
Everybody, this is Ricardo, from the Philippines and my kitchen floor.
Five hours on my moneymaker, sitting across from a gaggle of sailors flying home on leave, here I am in a committed relationship, and all I can think about is having a piece of Navy cake.
How does he always get my number? I don't know.
Anyway, I got big news, and I'll tell you over dinner.
Ugh! This idiot will fit in with our family as badly as
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
Hey, Chris, this field trip is your chance, man. Alyssa's all alone.
She's so pretty that, if your hacky sack were my private parts,
Today we commemorate those brave Quahog soldiers who perished in the recent Gulf conflict.
I can think of no greater tribute to their memories than this solid gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks frog.
The spirit of America is epitomized by his inspiring motto: Smack, smack, Sugar Smack. Gimme a smack, and I'll smack you back.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce extreme budget cutbacks having almost nothing to do with this solid-gold statue.
Have you ever seen such a waste of the taxpayers' money?
This is more exciting than that time me and my friends did mushrooms.
I'm opening a museum and putting you in it, they're that fabulous.
You think it's clever talking like that, do you? You think it's funny?
Talking about earrings, and using words like fabulous and delicious and wet.
Oh, what's next? A workout followed by a romp around a crowded room while the music goes...
Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something. When you're in the shower at the Y, is that just like Supermarket Sweep for you guys, or is there some kind of etiquette?
Sir, I think you should know these growths on your forearms they're giant tumors.
Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't realized this is not how a human being is supposed to look.
And the speech thing, and what you're doing with your eye... uh, you had a stroke about seven years ago.
That you've managed to be walking around all this time is nothing short of a miracle.
Oh, that is terrific! It's about time you two settled down.
Oh, you hear that, Meg? Guys can marry other guys now. So... um... this is awkward, but, uh... I mean, if they can do that, that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
I mean, you might as well pack it in. Game over.
I have a Young Republicans meeting after school. You wanna come?
Sure. What do you do at a Young Republicans meeting?
We help those who already have the means to help themselves.
Also, we perpetuate the ideal that Jesus chose America to destroy nonbelievers and brown people.
I don't understand what you're saying, but somehow I feel safer.
Karl, this is Chris. He wants to join our club.
And people walking by can stop and look at my thing
I'm here at the parking lot outside City Hall, where hundreds of citizens have come out in protest of the Mayor's decision to spend the town's treasury on a gold frog.
I don't like it. And I don't like the contraction, apostrophe E-M.
As far as I'm concerned, his name is Dig Them.
I stand behind my decision. This press conference is over.
I can't see you now. I can't hear you now. You're not here now.
Well, it's encouraging to know that I'm not the only Mayor West who's facing difficulties.
But what I need now is a diversion. Let's see.
Listen, Ricardo and I want to thank you for letting us have the wedding here.
Yeah. I hope that's okay, Lois. I offered them the house.
I heard you and your little chew toy getting it on last night. Keep it down.
Sorry, little man. Ricardo and I were playing Clue, and he got me in the bedroom with a lead pipe.
Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable having this wedding at the house.
Lois, I don't know what the big deal is. So they're gay.
It's not like we're gonna have a gay sex orgy in the living room.
If gays wanna get married and be miserable like the rest of us, I say we should let 'em.
Some breaking news today when Mayor West announced he will sign a citywide ban on gay marriages next week.
While controversial, it has nonetheless effectively distracted all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.
In the '30s, they called this an Uncle Spinny Dervish.
All I ever wanted was to get married and make a home with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy. Isn't that the American dream?
Mayor West only banned gay marriage so he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.
They're from a bakery in the West Quahog gay district.
Oh, my God, they pack so much fudge into these.
And look at this, there's even a couple of nuts lodged in there.
Jasper's always been there for me when I've needed him.
I am going to make Mayor West change his mind.
But, Brian, the Bible says gay marriage is an abomination.
The Bible also says a senior citizen built an ark and rounded up two of every animal.
What the hell is this? you didn't really give any specific guidelines about mating.
Yeah, it's going to be a hell of a lot harder for you now,
Hey, will you sign a petition to overturn Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?
Gay marriage? Oh, come on, two halves can't make a whole without a hole.
Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth, would you like to sign the petition?
Chris, did you hear? Some dog is going around town trying to get support for gay marriage.
Because if you do, I'll let you touch my boobs.
I'm a very open-minded person, and I've never had any problem with gays before, but something about two gay people getting married, I just don't think it's right.
Well, these questions are too big to be decided by human beings.
You know, there's been a lot of talk lately about homosexuals, but how do you know what to believe?
Well, here are a few tips that may help you tell when you've got a gay.
If his answer is anything but I've never bought one, you've got a gay.
If instead of human blood, you find a deadly corrosive acid, you've got a gay.
Well, we almost have enough signatures, thanks to Ouahog's gay district.
Lois, that's ridiculous. Gay people have every right to get married.
Well, they certainly have every right to be together, but marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Well, that's not how they do it in West Quahog.
By the way, Lois, I got a piercing over there.
I'm not going to tell you where, but I'll give you a hint.
It wasn't my nose or my ear and it was one of my balls.
Well, regardless of what you think, this is going to change Mayor West's mind, and we are going to have Jasper's wedding here.
Fine. Then until this is all over, I'll stay somewhere else.
Fine I'll go, but I'm not missing that gay wedding.
I still kick myself for missing that Topless Cheerleader Parade with the hundred-foot chocolate teddy bear and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics choreographed to the music of Queen.
I'm going to get to touch right-wing boob because of this.
You idiot! Now I'm going to have to get 10,000 more signatures before tomorrow morning. What were you thinking?!
When was the last time you were even with a woman?
Mayor West, here's the gay marriage ban for your approval.
I'm going to sign it with all capital letters. it's going to say, ADAM WEST.
I've been up for 24 hours, I paid off a few people and I did a few things in West Quahog I'm not proud of.
So, it's a show about three hookers and their mom?
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield the exact size of a bullet somewhere on my body. And if you hit it,
You can put an end to this right now by tearing up that gay marriage ban.
You won't break me. everything I needed to escape from a hostage situation.
Well, no matter. I'm prepared for a lengthy captivity as well.
All right, Paul Hogan, tell me about the real Crocodile Dundee.
God, this is such an old people house, you know.
Let's take a look in here. Let's see what you got here.
Yeah, yeah, I got a sweet tooth, I think I'll have some Freedent.
No, I don't think that's candy. I think it's a cough drop!
Uh, what else we got? Oh, look, look at this.
And now, some Channel 5 exclusive footage of the crazed homosexual gunman who's taken Mayor West hostage.
Gay marriage. Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.
Oh, oh, look at this. A spare key for a Volkswagen Scirocco.
What if Brian's right? I mean, certainly the love between a man and a woman should be sacred, but...
So two straight people who hate each other have more of a right to be together than two gay people who love each other?
She's brought music back into the house. Playing songs on the harp.
Of course, most of them are about rape, but it's still nice.
It's only a matter of time before Mayor West signs that bill, and you'll get to touch these.
Oh, boy, I got a feeling that before the end of the day,
Whoa, whoa, I said you could touch my boobs. Let's start with that.
Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian to come out peacefully, we're going to have to take him down.
Okay, Luke, this will keep you warm until I get the shelter built.
I was wrong. If two people love each other, they should have the right to get married.
But you have to come down and give yourself up.
If you drag this out any longer, you're only hurting your own cause.
Well, you were only doing what you thought was right, Brian.
And, hey, you've distracted everyone from the Dig 'Em statue, so I guess we don't need this bill anymore.
Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West to drop the kidnapping charges.
Amazing. All he asked for in return was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.
I really appreciate you putting your discomfort aside, so we can have the wedding here.
Two men getting married doesn't bother me in the least.
Now we can finally clear that Chief Petty Officer of all charges...
Oh, what's the point? Does anybody even watch this show?
I'm just here to let y'all know that movie night's been moved to Joe's place.
Yeah, but Joe just finished putting in his new home theater.
I built it myself with supplies I got at the Home Supply downtown.
Between you and me, I think Joe's got a little free time these days.
Here he is... Joe, what a great job you've done here.
Rocky, please don't go to Mars and fight the Martian.
Freakin' Joe with his home theater. Has to top everything I do.
Well, tomorrow I'm going to that home supply and I'm going to build an entire multiplex.
Well, let's just hope it looks better than that balcony you built.
Boy, that was a great episode of Lost, wasn't it, fellows?
Yeah, I hate my neighbor and I want to build something crazy out of spite.
I bet you could even get one of those gay mailboxes.
Just go ahead and put that right in here. Yeah.
I just bought a Rottweiler and I need a sign to warn people how dangerous it is.
So people will know if they step into my yard, there's only one way out... in a body bag... from dog injuries.
I haven't been this excited since I learned how to speak Braille.
Hey, bump, bump, no bump, bump, three vertical bumps, four bumps and a square.
Ah, the more you hear it, the funnier it gets.
Peter, I really think you should put that back where you found it.
You know, Brian, I really don't think you should breast-feed the skull.
Look at me, everybody. I'm breast-feeding in public even though it's wrong.
Maybe I'm through supposing and I fix to start figuring.
I can't wait to see the expression on Joe's legs when I open my multiplex.
I have to say I'm a little concerned about the zoning for...
No, Lois, I'm getting up and walking all the way to the bathroom and doing it there.
The only time of the day I get to try out my Fred Schneider B-52s voice.
Ross and Rachel got back together. It wasn't that great.
No, they did a spin-off. He's still playing Joey, but... eh, it's not doing so well.
Uh, Lois, have you, uh, noticed some spooky things going on ever since Peter brought that skull into the house?
Well, like the whole business last night with the TV.
Oh, I must have accidentally stacked all those things upside down and then just forgot about it. Yeah, that's probably what happened.
Well, I haven't seen this much denial since John Travolta married Kelly Preston.
And I'm going to do stuff to her, too, like... touch her.
Okay, okay, try to think of a happy place to be. Happy place...
Hey, I'm Stewie Griffin, and I'm going to be kicking my dad's ass all day today.
I wish that scary-looking clown at the end of my bed would go away.
Oh, wait, hold on a second. I want to try something.
We've never hired a spiritual medium before, but I'll do anything to get my baby back.
You know, Peter, we wouldn't have to be messing around with ghosts if you hadn't desecrated those Indian remains.
Probably a bad time to mention I'm wearing the skull as an athletic cup.
Y'all got a little friend of ours named Stewart up there.
We was just wondering if you could send him back.
Well, I don't see how that's anybody's business but my own.
Well, how about you and my father go and hang out at the gun range some afternoon and you can spend the whole day just agreeing with each other.
They said that your baby had entered their world through the closet upstairs and that the exit is...
Well, I don't know how else to say this, but... the exit is your daughter's bum.
Okay, Meg, if this works, then we might just have a chance at getting Stewie back.
Stewie?! Stewie, if you can hear me head for Meg's butt!
And, Lois, get ready to laugh. Get ready to laugh.
We just got to be patient, Lois, like waiting on the results of a blood test, a real important blood test.
Only if he can find his way into the light, Chris.
Some people just get lost on the way to the light.
They're walking along, they stop and say, Ooh, is that a new restaurant? That place must've just opened up.
Cause I remember there was another place there a few weeks ago.
I went in there once and there was a guy with a harelip eating soup, and I was like, Ew... '
It wasn't the restaurant's fault, I know. But I still never went back there.
I mean, I guess there's only, like, a one in 50 chance of me getting the same spoon that he had, but I still don't like them odds.
If Stewie can't find his way out of Meg's ass, we have to enter the other realm and get him ourselves.
I'll tell you what's not safe: going hunting with Dick Cheney.
Now she knows how I felt when I was at her piano recital.
Oh, thank God you guys are... ew! You're covered in slime.
Ugh! This must be how Tom Arnold felt on his wedding night.
Yeah, I kind of thought you guys would attend to that.
A bit of breaking news. A local family is forced out of their home by ghosts.
And now back to Disney's Too Many Ostriches starring Don Knotts.
Says he has no idea where people are getting Christ.
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts, and now our house is gone and we got no place to stay.
Peter, I'm really slammed right now. Can you give me the short version?
So, as you can see, my family's here. and, uh, it's game night.
Well, it'll just be good to get some food in us.
I'll just start you off with this basket of pizza crusts and apple cores.
It's an avocado pit with a little bit of avocado still on it, and that comes on a ripped pair of boxer shorts.
Now, I'm trying to decide between the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper and the half yogurt with the balled-up tissue in it.
Hi, there. Do you have any books on how to get rid of ghosts?
Have you tried telling them you're ready for a commitment?
All right, here it is. To vanquish poltergeists, one must restore all disturbed remains to their original resting places.
So, all we got to do is bring the skull back home and bury it.
You said you were using the skull as an athletic cup.
I was, but don't you remember, I threw it in the garbage?
God, I hate it when they pester you like that.
We're looking for a skull that my husband threw away.
A skull, huh? Then you want the human remains bin.
But I should warn you folks, we're pretty cleaned out right now,
'cause Carrot Top comes by every morning to rummage for new props.
Well, then we'll just have to pay this Carrot Top a visit.
Except for that one show he did in Ohio after the airline lost his luggage.
I hope it goes well, 'cause I don't have my prop trunk.
I normally have, like, a case with all my... little props and gadgets and what not, but... it's okay, you can use your imagination, like maybe a piece of luggage, that shoots dog biscuits, so, like, if you had, like, weed in your bag and you went to the airport, you could shoot the dog biscuits out, and then, the drug dog would be... would go away from your bags, kind of... if you can imagine the dog... the dog...
Man, it's a lot funnier if I had my prop.
So, you having a good time there, Chief Diamond Phillips?
Oh, that's funny, he came up with the same thing that... All right, Carrot Top!
I put it on my head, and it's a skull cap!
Very well, Mr. Griffin, I'll give you the skull, but you have to catch me first!
But which one of us is the real king of prop comedy and not just an illusion, huh?
What the hell? How'd you get through the trap door?!
Oh, God. You know what? Here, here, just, you know what?
Well, Chief, time for you to go back where you came from.
Once again, you brought our family to the edge of the abyss, and at the very last minute, you saved us all.
Well, I guess we're going to have to do this the hard way.
Oh, my God, there are men breaking into our house.
Well, I got the idea to build a panic room after I saw that movie The Butterfly Effect.
I wish I could escape to a place where this movie couldn't find me,
Peter, there's no phone in here. How are we going to call the police?
But I think it's important for the last one of us left alive to know this story.
It was a Saturday night and God and his roommate Chugs were arm wrestling.
Oh, wait, wait, here comes another one. Quick, give me your lighter.
Of course, I'm obligated by the State of Kansas to present the church's alternative to the theory of evolution.
After that, a meteor hit the Earth turning it into a block of ice for some reason, but then it thawed and cavemen came.
Peter show wheel to people in town, but no one want wheel.
Maybe if me buy wheel, me get pretty lady, too.
There have been many great Griffins through out history, including Moses Griffin who led the Jews out of Egypt.
All right, it's going to be a long journey everyone, but I will lead you to freedom.
You know, what they flush in Cairo ends up right here.
You know he hasn't talked to his brother in three years.
I'm going to lay down a few rules, all right?
Commandment number two: There's nothing I can do about the sun.
Commandment number three: There are no more Jolly Ranchers, they're all gone.
Commandment number four: When we pass a billboard, please don't read it out loud.  All right? Now, come on, let's get going.
Ooh, look at that. Danny Gans, Entertainer of the Year.
We need to figure out how we're going to survive.
Wait a minute, that's a great idea. If Meg can get through the vent,
Yeah, she's right. We need to grease her up so she doesn't get stuck.
I meant I can't do it because there are burglars down there.
Come on, they're not going to touch you. You're covered with spit.
No, no, no, don't use that mustard. Use the other mustard.
I think they're making a sign to tell us something.
Better not be using my crayons... mixing 'em up. We have your son?
You know, Meg being captured by evil men reminds me of another story.
It all began in Africa in the tiny village of Quahog-swana where he was a proud member of the tribe of Tootie-an-Blair.
Oh, it was awesome. You never feel as big as you do with a pygmy.
Hey, you guys want to go get a drink at Club 227?
Not today, Joemama. I'm going off to find a log to build a drum so I can play the opening part from Hot For Teacher.
Coming up in this half hour, flies on your face how many is too many?
But first, that orange thing in the sky and what you can do to please it.
White men have been spotted nearby laying traps and forming slow-pitch softball leagues.
Well, whatever makes them happy. Live and let live, that's what I say.
Hello and welcome to the news at what I suspect is dawn.
Our top story continues to be where is this giant canoe heading?
But first let's go to Ollie Williams with the port side window report.
If we can break out of here, I've got an idea how to give the captain of this boat what he deserves.
Are you ready for the birds and bees, the apple trees
But Nate soon found himself put to work on a Southern plantation.
It was way down there. You know, when you stop seeing Howard Johnson's and you start seeing Stuckey's. Anyway, it was a horrible place where they took away everybody's African names and gave them new names.
With an accent over the I, and a little lineover the O so you know it's a long vowel sound and not a short one.
And sometimes I like to dot the I with a little smiley face or a heart or something.
Honey, you keep that up it's what every you want it to be.
Of course, back then the South was a very different place than it is today.
A backward place where they didn't believe in science and hated others just for being different.
Time has a way of changing a place and its people.
Is there like a human resources guy we could talk to?
The quarters are too crowded, the hours are long and... you know, I don't like to be this guy, but... a couple of the overseers have been making racial slurs.
Of course, ordinarily black guys aren't attracted to white women, but she was something different.
As a poet might say, she was the kind of woman you just want to have sex with over and over.
With the kind of breasts you just want to push together so she looks like a cross-eyed torso.
Hi. I'm Nate Griffin. I work against my will for your dad.
Well, let's just say I know my way around a hoe.
And, from the moment that piece of off-color blue comedy was uttered, their lives were changed forever.
So, for the next 15 years, they raised a family in secrecy.
You know the best part about being half black and half white?
Lois, how in God's name, could you embarrass the family like this?
Daddy, you're the embarrassment. Nate and I love each other!
Tell it to the authorities, because you're all going to jail!
And so they set off on their escape to the north.
Luckily, they were helped by Nate's good friend, Al Cowlings, who showed up on his trusty white bronco.
Well, we're getting a good view of the chase from up here, Tom.
That's right, Diane. We're looking at Nate Griffin and Al Cowlings the man we believe to be Al Cowlings. We'll stay with the chase.
Uh... it seems like a futile effort on their part, Diane.
At some point, that horse is going to have to stop and eat some grain.
But luck was on their side and eventually, they made it to the north.
After that, Nate devoted his life to getting back at the white man for the injustice of slavery, by inventing the Department of Motor Vehicles.
That's the 1190. You're gonna have to go stand in the blue line.
I wait in one line, they send me to another line...
If we angle it through the vent, we might be able to alert the authorities.
Peter, these are parachutes. What are we supposed to do with these?
They're supposed to distract you while I put on the one scuba suit.
That was a tank of Tony Danza's breath. I wonder who got my oxygen tank.
Well, as long as death is staring us in the face,
I might as well tell you about my great grandfather, who was the greatest silent movie star of the '20s.
His name was Willy Black-Eye Griffin, and his ocular misadventures made him a star.
Black-Eye Griffin and his family were among the wealthiest people in Hollywood.
They spent their idle time cavorting, doing the Charleston and enjoying America's prosperity following World War I, which, at that time, was called International Civil War II.
Sadly, Black-Eyed Griffin's voice just wasn't right for the talking pictures.
I found these two children of yours playing hooky from school.
It was a simpler time. It was a better time.
Well, no matter what happens to us, I just hope Meg's okay.
So, is, uh... is this, like, the part where you guys have your way with me?
You know, where I'm, like, helpless, and you guys taketurns.
She asked if we were gonna have our way with her.
Well, it sure would suck if you guys died without hearing the story of my great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was Adolf's favorite brother.
Hey, you ready to go check out that new skin flick over at the booben garden?
What happened to the 50 marks I gave you last week?
Look, I'm going to do a rally. I'll be back in an hour.
All of Europe will tremble as Germany take sits rightful place as ruler of the world!
Yes. As I was saying, the time for victory is upon us!
You know what? You guys, with your marching and your letters and your phone calls, this is all thanks to you. You made this happen, you guys... My God! Give yourselves a round of applause! Come on.
Hey, what do you say we all head over to the Buzenpuken, eh?
Well, that's pretty much all there is to tell, kids.
But, since we're all gonna die, there's one more secret I feel I have to share with you:
Robert De Niro, Al Pacino... I mean, you never see...
I know. Fine, fine actor. Did not like the movie.
'Cause it has a valid point to make, it's insistent!
It takes forever getting in, and then you spend, like six and half hours, and then,
I can't even get through it. I can't even finish the movie.
How can you say you don't like it if you haven't even given it a chance?
I have tried, on three separate occasions, to get through it, and I...
I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on easy chairs...
Like they're speaking a different language. That's why I lose interest and I go away.
The language they're speaking is the language of subtlety, something you don't understand.
Oh, sweetie, thank you for keeping our spirits up with your stories.
If you don't do anything, she could go to jail for a long time.
Don't thank me, Lois. Thank my ancestors for living lives of greatness.
Quahog is seeing its worst flu epidemic in years, due in part to a severe shortage of flu shots.
Let's go live to Asian flu correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Tricia?
Thank you, Tricia. We now return you to Robin, Boy Wonder.
Yeah. Everyone else was busy so, uh, they sent me.
What the hell are you going to do? You don't have any superpowers.
Well, I guess I'll be heading out then and... Whoa!
Oh, well, since it's already in there, you might as well, push down on the ol' plunger there.
You know what was a monster? Frampton Comes Alive, 1976.
Is there anyone you knew who didn't have that record? I don't think so.
Well, you're 42 years old and it says here you've never had a prostate exam.
No, but I've had other exams. Like that one in college.
All right, Mr. Griffin, I'm just going to need you to drop your pants and we'll check your prostate.
So, how's this work, you just feel my pulse or...
It's an important part of a physical for men your age.
I'm trying to be supportive but after all, it was just a prostate exam.
God, I should take her out right here with these, man.
Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring? Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?
Oh, oh, what's that, oh, you come back for more, huh?
Why don't you go away? I don't want to be your friend.
Oh, Rupert, please live. Please, I'll never be short with you again.
W-We'll go away. W-We'll go to Hawaii. Would you like that?
I never knew there could be such a thing as a perfect day.
Don't frolic too much, Rupert. Save some energy for the hula contest.
And to help you feel better, I made your favorite dinner.
Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged according to size from largest to smallest, and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.
Peter, what's the matter with you today? You're not yourself.
Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman yesterday and... he did things to my fanny.
I, too, have felt the cold finger of injustice on my insidey parts.
I only went in there for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval, but I turned out to be the guinea pig, for a sexual experimentation.
Oh, God, it was horrible! I scrubbed and I scrubbed, but damn it, they don't make water hot enough!
My God, we've all been victims of Dr. Hartman's prostate exam.
I am going to sue that bastard and make him pay out the ass.
Well, why shouldn't I be? You saved Rupert's life and I love you for it.
You can't do that, all he did was give you a prostate exam.
You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at the mall who says he'll take any case,
Well, whatever happens, I'm not going to stand for this.
Excuse me, do you know how to get to town?
Just in case, I'll say it again. I love you.
Look at that little foot. I'm gonna eat that foot.
Oh, it is so hard to find funny women, and you are hilarious.
Sit right there, honey. Mommy'll go get Rupert so he can eat with you.
Uh, hey, Brian. Uh, listen, I've got a favor to ask.
Could you, uh, could you not talk to Lois anymore?
You know, it's just I'm tired of you hitting on her. That's all, it's-it's not cool.
I was just making coffee. I didn't hit on her.
Besides, Lois is my friend. I'll do whatever the hell I want.
I'll make you a hamburger. Perhaps I'll make it blue.
Uh, Stewie, I love you, but you're wearing Mommy out.
Our top story : a local woman loses her sex drive after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.
But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman, beloved family doctor to all of Quahog, is the target of a molestation lawsuit.
Peter, I don't know how much more I can take.
Stewie used to be so independent, but now he just clings to me night and day. I'm exhausted.
Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. The sun revolves around me.
I'm the one who's got to go to court tomorrow.
Peter, isn't there anything I can do to talk you out of this lawsuit?
Hey, I was violated sexually and that man is going to pay.
And I suppose it wouldn't matter if I told you for the 50th time that it's a legitimate medical procedure to test for cancer.
Is it not true that you went to see Dr. Hartman for a simple prostate exam?
At first, I thought he was nice and that he was kind of handsome.
I trusted him and then, he told me to bend over.
I tried to get him to stop, but he kept saying, Relax, I'm a doctor.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to wait until I've heard everything.
Your Honor, I can't believe you're even listening to this.
I gave you a prostate exam last year, don't you remember?
Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy and black and white? Think about it.
God, I've looked forward to this moment more than the second coming of Jesus.
Okay, everybody, uh, I know you were expecting something else, but as science will tell you, people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.
So let's try to be adult about this. Uh, no snickering and... Hey!
Okay, so if we can all be mature... give me the gum, we can all get through this a lot faster.
I have so much fun when we hang out, Lois, and I love your hair.
We should make up a name for your hair color.
We could call it, like, like, strawberry sunset or ginger maiden, o-o-or-or one of those hair color names that's a random noun, like like temptress.
Oh, at some point, you have to let me braid it!
I'm like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage by holding him underwater. I'm just like Barbara Bush!
Brian, what kind of a mother has homicidal thoughts about her own baby? I'm a horrible person.
Somehow, you've got to break Stewie of this new over dependence on you.
Two tickets, won'em on the radio. We're gonna have a ball.
God, he's like a totally different person, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu.
Yeah, what'd you do with your pain and suffering money?
Yeah, what do you think of new sexy lips Peter?
I tell you, boys, this is a victory not just for my anus but for anuses...
That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a... Oh, I got to take a leak.
If it's gale-force peeing you be doing, it could mean you've got barnacles on your prostate.
Wait a minute. Are you telling me I need a prostate exam?
Aye, and soon, before your rudder jams with flotsam and you're dropping anchor without an order from the captain.
But no doctor in town will see you after that lawsuit.
Well, then, I'll just find a doctor out of town.
Listen, uh, I know I'm not a regular patient, but I think I have some trouble with my prostate.
Lois, what are you doing? I want to sleep in your bed.
Damn you, I will not be ignored! Get back in here!
He's just being melodramatic. You've got to ignore it if you really want to help him.
I mean, I have, uh, sort of been hitting the gym, so uh, if-if you wanted to see how it's going...
Dr. Hartman is my only hope, and there's no way he's going to see me.
You just, uh, carry a picture of a diseased prostate around with you?
Never know when it's going to come up in conversation and then, who's the one who's prepared?
I've also got a map of Middle Earth, a cat doing a pull-up, and the guys from Primus.
I need her love. I need her love, and she's ignoring me.
I ate this whole jar of pills that look like candy and now I feel sick.
What is this? A Tommy Lee pool party? Come on, Lois, get with the...
And to think I ignored your cries for attention. I'm so sorry, honey.
Never again, Stewie. I'm going to give you all the love you could ever want.
You had your chance and you blew it. Well, now you're too late.
I hope they charge you with child abuse for my broken arm.
I'll testify against you just like I did against Michael Jackson.
Well, yes, but the worst part was he never called back.
No, but in all seriousness, yeah, he was actually pretty aggressive.
Uh, so why don't you go ahead and open it up and reach on in there?
I think there may actually be something wrong with my prostate.
Well, don't look at me. I lost my license, thanks to you.
Look, I-I know what I did was wrong, but you're the only one I can turn to.
So, I'm asking you... as a man with no more options... will you take a look in my ass?
Oh, well, this is nothing. Just a little swelling. Probably a minor infection.
Well, I was going to, but you ran out of the room.
Maybe we'll get lucky and see another crash this year.
I'd rather be home watching that video from The Ring.
Peter, don't... they say if you watch that video you die.
Ladies and gentlemen, keep your eye on the sky for the aerial acrobatics of Captain Glen Quagmire.
Um, yeah, could I get a better look at number two?
Look at him like you haven't seen him in a while and you're happy.
Okay, and, um, number three could you say, Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives.
Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives.
Hey, everybody, it's Weenie and the Butt here live at the Quahog Air Show.
I don't think they can say my catchphrase, because... They no funny!
And if you think you can say that just like Weenie here, you could win 97.1 dollars for the cool weekend ahead.
Cool weekends in the morning with Weenie and the Butt.
Stewie Griffin, will you please report to the radio booth.
Peter and Lois leave the radio on when they go out so I feel like somebody's home.
And now back to Round Table, with Al Michaels, Harold Ramis, Ray Romano, and Kermit the Frog.
There zoning laws are infringing on the rights of citizens...
Uh, if I might interrupt for a minute, I'd like to point out that--
Don't look at me, I can't get a word in edgewise.
Well, then who the hell's been talking this whole time?
I never see you, and then you finally come visit me and you drop a bombshell like this?
This is just like what happened at the Peanuts reunion.
Boy, this is really going to upset my evil brother, Thaddeus.
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin, and you're listening to The Lunch Hour, serving up food for the mind.
Caller, you're on The Lunch Hour. Can I take your order?
Yes, uh, I'll have a big helping of the pretentious crap.
Um, yes, that turkey, that- that raw turkey that you ate off the counter last week that got Lois mad, when you pooped that out was the timer still in there?
Join us next week, when our guest will be Gore Vidal.
And remember, life is full of entrees, so don't fill up on bread.
I'm going to throw you now to Weenie and The Butt in the afternoon.
That-that was this guy I know. He thinks he's hilarious.
I was on my way in here to cancel your show, but the banter you did with that guy, well, as we say in the radio business, If you put that on the radio, people will listen to it!
Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.
In my view, as good as the Yankees were in the first half of this game, that's how as bad they've been now.
Poor Peter, I know he's having a hard time with this  whole divorce thing.
I feel kind of guilty that I'm here looking for a date.
Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web who had to overcome Tourette's.
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker trying to get back on my feet after having my ass handed to me by my bitch of an ex-wife.
Oh, no, you see, if you're one of ten million Americans like me...
Like me. ...with a bladder control problem, punch just goes right through you.
Did you have a good time at your prostitutes convention?
Peter, I was just trying to help your mother meet some new friends.
Come on, Mom, you can't stay in bed all day.
You got to call dad and get back together with...
You were messing around in what was basically my first apartment.
I don't see the problem, either, but let's go to Ollie Williams for the inepth analysis. Ollie?
He won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds.
The only reason you're here is that my boss ordered me to bring you on.
All right, this is my show, and it's a serious, intellectual hour of discussion and I want to keep it that way.
From the station that reaches the beaches, you're listening to Dingo and The Baby!
Wha-What the hell does that have to do with anything?
They're just wacky sounds, you know to liven things up.
Uh, hello, yes, uh, this is, uh, this is Tom Tucker's personal physician,
Um, could you tell Tom his contagious penis cancer medicine is ready.
Cut it out. Maybe I'll tickle you, huh, how about that?!
I tickle you, you hit me in the head with a frying pan?!
Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment for you, but all I want is for your mom to be happy.
Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do my best to make her even happier than those kids on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.
No, but how about if Spider-Man gives you a $50 gift card to Sears?!
Hey, Carl, can I get a carton of smokes, please?
And uh, what's that little rubber mailman you got behind there?
All right, I'll take that, and I'm gonna hurry home and show it to Lois.
You're Dingo, that dog that plays all those fart sounds on the radio!
Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that, the show's gotten a little lowbrow.
Wow, you're... gosh, you're making me feel more important than a dwarf among midgets.
How awesome is this : going out to dinner with my new family?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that, and I'll-I'll meet you up there in like five minutes.
Well, Lois, I never realized what it was like to have a real dad.
I feel like I have a real family, you know?
I mean I'm-I'm not just going through the motions like I do around here.
Tom, there's no easy way to say this, I'll just come right out with it.
Tommy, this has been great, but I wasn't looking for anything long-term.
I just needed someone to clear all the bats out of my plumbing.
I know it hurts right now, Peter, but we'll get through this.
No stranger than when Darth Vader was a meter maid.
You know, I make your annual salary in a week.
You do whatever you think is right, and I'll support it.
I want to build a giant space station that can destroy a planet.
I don't know that that would be a good investment on our end.
Today, we got Homeless Hank from the Dumpster out back with us.
How about the first three women willing to come down and have sex with Hank get free boob jobs courtesy of Dr. John Viener?
Go ahead caller, you're on with Dingo and The Baby.
Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like to come down here and get naked for us?
But no matter how you come to judge, Charles Wheeler and his partners' unethical, moral, and inhuman terms, the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.
I swear to God, that was supposed to be Food Fight!
Don't, don't you... get down from that chair, or you're in big trouble.
Uh... if you put that ice cream in your mouth you're gonna be in big trouble, young man!
We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon, and for every hot dog that you catch in your mouth, you get a $100 toward a boob job that you desperately need.
Aw, you got her in the eye with that one.
Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you stick around and talk for a while.
My listeners would love to hear about your new book.
Hey, it's all about ratings, baby, and we got 'em.
I'm more of a sell-out than you were when you did those Butterfinger commercials.
He's my dad and he hasn't paid attention to me in weeks.
I think the Kennedys had a kid like you, and they had it put to sleep.
Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about that business with the ice cream.
I guess I'm just still a little torn up about your mom.
But, hey, I'll make it up to you. Let's play catch.
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like to have a real father.
Huh, I guess I've learned a little something about what it means to be a good dad.
Man, I haven't had this much fun since I was in that Broadway show.
Look up there, here comes a really angry Russian helicopter
Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you to pick up Meg at the roller rink.
Oh, Meg is my least favorite of all your children.
It's all right, we'll just move the party to the skating rink.
Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk?
You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on, you got to get your car home.
Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus?
And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official.
Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs up against glass in public just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill!
Hey, baby, how'd you like to share a pair of skates?
I don't even remember why we came, but I had a ball.
Remember when you hit that pedestrian with your car at the crosswalk  and then just drove away?
But Pepperidge Farm ain't just gonna keep it to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge.
Maybe you go outand buy yourself some of these distinctive Milano cookies, maybe this whole thing just disappears.
Fat Ass and his drunk friends left me at the roller rink.
You know, this wouldn't have happened if I had my own car.
Meg, people have always found ways to get around without a car.
Honey, where'd you go when you went out last night?
What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months, but she gets a freakin' car just like that?!
Dude, those animals are so fucking funny, they make me want to merge without looking!
Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car that goes with her personality.
Oh, that's just an old tank I use for those commercials where I declare war on high prices.
We come in here wanting a practical car, but then you dangle this tank in front of me and expect me to walk away.
Now, I may be an idiot, but there is one thing I am not, sir, and that, sir, is an idiot.
Now, I demand you tell me more about this tank.
Well, if you're looking for quality, then look no further.
Three inches of reinforced steel protects your daughter from short-range missile attacks.
Hey, Peter, can you blow that towel rack down here?
But if you want to come over here, that's okay, too.
I've been asking you for months to get rid of that stump!
I'll do it, all right?! Just get off my back!
My money paid for that tank, and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.
Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin my good time.
All right, Meg, you got a feel for the controls.
I don't know where you got that thing, but I'm impounding it!
I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson confiscate the closest thing I had to a car.
Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing I've ever done.
You remember that favor I did for that park ranger?
Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what we got in this pic-a-nic basket.
I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.
Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day to smell my sneakers.
You know, I read that they're opening a Superstore USA across town.
They don't pay their employees a decent wage or give them health benefits.
Yeah, right. You hate all megastores, ever since you were petted way too hard by that special boy in front of Kmart.
You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime, no health benefits, and every day at 3:00, you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.
I would go out with you if I wasn't already in a committed relationship.
In fact, the only guy in town making any money is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.
Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing what I've been trying to explain to you.
That mega store is a big, evil corporation that means nothing but trouble for this town.
Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.
Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site and can sell beer at a much cheaper price.
Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.
Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look on the ground for five seconds
You know what, just get the hell out of here.
Oh, Peter, you lost your job because of the Superstore, you shouldn't blame Meg.
And you can stop making that fart sound every time someone says Meg.
So, how was your day exploiting the town's resources, Meg?
I'm the only one in this family who has a job.
At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering it's worst heat wave in a century.
We now go live to Ollie Williams with the Blaccu-weather report.
In other news, Quahog will be experiencing rolling blackouts to help meet Superstore USA's extensive power demands.
Oh, in fact, Channel Five has just received this message from the Electric Company.
It's coming down the line, Strong as it can be, Through the courtesy
Contrary to those upbeat lyrics, the Electric Company would like us to emphasize it will not be bringing you the power.
Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off all the city's power.
That new paper boy done gone and broke my sternum.
You know, instead of sitting around complaining, why don't we go down there and protest?
All we need is some magic markers, posterboard, some plywood...
Actually, Superstore USA has all that stuff. We can just get it there.
Peter, I don't think it's working. People are still going into the store.
Well, fine, then I guess I got to go in there and drag 'em out one by one.
When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation... that I'm standing on a mountain top with the wind blowing through my hair.
What would a guy like me have to do to be part of this magical world?
You are trespassing on private property and I must ask you to leave.
Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward to this job.
Look, Dad, this isn't going to be a cakewalk, all right?
Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better at this job than I did on the SAT's.
I know I'm not supposed to go outside the lines, but I do anyway because I like being myself.
This is even worse than getting herpes from a toilet seat.
You know, I had such a great time with you last night.
Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?
I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA, while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat.
There's got to be something we can do to take that place down.
Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find a assault rifles?
Boy, I'm a little chilly. I hope no one notices.
What's more important to you, your job or your family?
Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up on some plunger nipples.
Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this, but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable of performing the simplest tasks.
Meg, that was a wonderful thing you just did for me.
I can't believe this is coming out of my mouth, but...
Any problem caused by a tank can be solved by a tank.
Dad, you were about to say something in the store.
Now please take your seats for the following presentation by the U.S. Army.
We're here to tell you how much the army kicks ass! Check this out!
I could get the clap from a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.
You'll be serving your country, just like American film legend Mickey Rooney.
Hi. I'm former biggest star in the world, Mickey Rooney.
And as you may know, I am totally and completely insane.
I like to yell at mice with my shirt off.
Take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and before you know it, you'll be up on your roof; pooping in the chimney.
Now, the marines, those are the men you want to (beep).
You get to save money for college, there's free food, and all the brown people you can rape.
I am sorry, but he is not joining the army.
I can't believe they're brainwashing kids like Chris to serve in the military.
Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent of our high school class is off to fight another battle.
I read that in The Onion. About the war in Iraq.
Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've got some sharp cookies over at the, uh...
So if I go up to your room right now,
I'm not gonna find a copy of The Onion, right?
Coming this fall, if you loved Everybody Loves Raymond, then you'll love his brother, Robert, even more, in Robert.
I bet you Debra really gave it to Ray today.
I bet you she made a sandwich that wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway.
And then she got mad at him 'cause he gave her a funny look.
I can't believe Chris would just buy into that army recruiter's sales pitch.
Don't worry, Lois, all he needs is an after-school activity to get his mind off the army. Just something to distract him.
You know, like all of America gets distracted whenever a cute white girl dies.
We regret to report that not all the children onboard the school bus survived.
We have identified the body of one victim, nine-year-old Becky Gunderson.
I just want to swing by the army recruiting center and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.
We are gonna be so late. I'm not gonna have a partner.
It's just wrong for the military to mess with kids' minds.
They're all gonna wind up in therapy, like Peter was.
I just want to punch her in the face. She's really annoying.
What the hell's wrong with you? Your skin's, like, moving around or something.
Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun activities out there.
Pfft, maybe if she spent some time on the treadmill and I was drunk.
I don't think any of this stuff is right for me, Dad.
Like Laura Dern if she didn't look like a banana.
I like reading comic books and dressing like a dude.
Guys, I think we just found our new lead singer.
I'm gonna be a famous music star, like Muddy Waters!
Oh, I think I'm about to pass a kidney stone.
Yes, you'll be about as effective as the Wizard of Oz was at granting wishes.
And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes, but little did you know, you've had herpes all along.
Oh, you'll have to have a seat. There's a 25-minute wait.
Oh, God. All right, I better go put more money in the meter.
Peggy, would you send in the next... Oh, you're already here.
Say, aren't you a little young to join the army?
Did I mention there's a hundred-dollar bonus if you sign up a buddy?
Really? Well, I think I have a surprise for somebody.
And we won't come back till it's over over there.
You are the sorriest bunch of rejects I ever seen.
They only got two things in Quahog : steers and queers.
I don't see no horns on you. What does that make you, boy?
Well, actually, yeah, your last little, uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie, that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny.
Ooh, that's got to hurt worse than getting a birthday telegram from
And we are gonna rock this place until... un... well, until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over!
I'm hiding underneath my seat for fear he'll point and show his teeth!
Quiet, young man. Can't you see we're having a poker game?
If I order a pizza, will anyone else have some?
Well, you know, I'm gonna need more of a commitment than that, Mark.
Griffin! You got four legs there! You better start using them!
You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack, or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their toothbrushes.
Bill, how about thinking up your own jeers for a change, huh?
Let's say hypothetically that it does belong to someone in here.
Would admission of that allow that person to keep it?
Private Griffin, just for that, you have to listen to one track from this Chris Gaines album.
It's so stupid, it's just Garth Brooks in a wig.
That's it! Every single track, plus the hidden bonus track!
Huh. Should I follow the knight into the dungeon or should I go back the way I came?
Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came. I didn't take my hand off the page.
You seen it, Lois, right? You seen my hand on the page.
You know, I'm glad Chris found an activity he likes, but why do they have to use our garage?
That's it! I will come back there and, so help me God,
They'll come after you like Peter went after that hockey coach.
Let me ask you this : when was the last time you saw something through to the end?
You dropped out of college. You still haven't finished your novel.
And so you know where you'll get it? Right here in the army!
Everything I've ever done I've crapped out on halfway through.
Well, not this time. I am going to finish what I started.
That's the spirit! You can do anything you put your mind to.
You know, it's really hard to masturbate with you guys talking.
Chris, will you knock that off for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you.
Now it's time for you to come inside and do your homework.
Hey, hey, Chris, don't talk to your mother that way.
Oh, way to stand up for your woman there, fatty.
Chris, what the hell is going on with you lately?
Ever since you hooked up with this band, you're like a completely different person, and I don't like it one bit.
Now, get out of my way! I'm going to the park to loiter.
He's acting worse than you did when you tried to cover your farts by coughing.
On the subject of school lunches, I know there's been some concern about nutrition...
This obstacle course represents the final test of your training.
Almost all of you have completed it in the allotted time.
But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate, or none of you graduate. Griffin, it's up to you.
All right, you can do this, Brian. Come on, pray with me.
There's a lot of fish in the sea. It's always darkest before the dawn.
If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.
Oh, I say, this is an even bigger accomplishment than getting Minnie Driver's head to fit on screen.
I'm sure you'll do your country proud tomorrow morning, when you're all shipped off to Iraq.
I say, the media has totally blown this whole thing out of proportion.
Okay, I go in store, I throw backpack. Big boom.
Okay, right, so I throw backpack, come back and have big hero party with many virgins.
Okay, yeah. See you in a few minutes, big hero.
I don't know. I just thought you're supposed to say names and numbers.
Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah, Charlie, Tango, Cash, uh, 47, Victor, Charlie, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!
Chris, your father and I are very upset by this new attitude of yours.
I am so self-conscious about what people think of me.
You know, I think I may have an idea what's causing this behavior, Peter.
Listen to these lyrics. I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches. I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits.
Oh, look, they've got a translation for white people : I give 110 percent when it comes to helping my community, even though I occasionally associate with some less than reputable characters.
Who does he or she think he or she is?
You're right, we got to find this Marilyn Manson and I got to give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis.
All right, it shouldn't be too hard to get ourselves kicked out.
Right. We're just got to convince them we're not army material.
Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on. That looks like it's painful.
Of course it's painful! There's a bullet in my foot!
No, no, no, oh, come on, this is flat out just not safe!
Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain right now, the two of us.
Hey, hi, um, I'm Private Stewie and this is Private Brian.
Uh, we both got shot in the foot, so, uh, we figured an honorable discharge would be in order and, uh, you could just send us back to the States.
I mean, we got two dead guys guarding the ammunition.
Sorry, guys, you are here until the job is done.
There was only one man in the world with the vision to predict something like this.
He used to be a sweet boy until he heard your music.
I'm hiding underneath my seats for fear he'll point and show his teeth!
Listen, your parents tell me you've been acting out a little bit.
And I just wanted to tell you, rock n' roll music is cool, but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to.
And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen is with a healthy breakfast rich in breads and grains.
And now, I think your parents have something to say.
Chris, you don't really believe all the things in those song lyrics, do you?
Peter, when was the last time you and Chris here did something together?
They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal.
What do you say, Chris? You want to go fishing with your old man?

Damn it, look at my foot. It's already starting to swell up.
God, I'm looking forward to this week. Freaking swelled foot all week.
You know, we should... You should probably go ahead and shut that off.
And guess what? I smuggled a whole bunch of fireworks back in my anus.
You could have just put them in your car and driven them up here.
You be David Koresh and I'll be a heavy-handed FBI agent.
You know, no huge hurry, but I'm sort of out of juice over here.
We have to hurry! I learned in Biology if you get them back soon enough, they can be reattached.
Maybe if we make it mad, it'll come down here and we can catch it and get the finger.
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, I knew that would get you.
Ah, ah, come here. You little son of a bitch, come here!
Let's plant a knife on him just to be safe.
Uh, hey there. We were supposed to have brunch this morning.
The excuses for why we can't hang out, the inside-out collar.
I'd have to be as dim as those retirees I entertain every Thursday.
Whoa-ho-ho, all right. We're getting a little faster here now.
I think there's something else down there in the bottom of the sea.
There's a tube in the throat of the elderly man
In the hospital bed on the frog on the log
There's a tube in the throat of the elderly man
In the hospital bed on the frog on the log
There's a birthday cake for Mr. Cohen on the frog
On the log in the hole in the bottom of the sea
There's a birthday cake for Mr. Cohen in the hole
Look, Brian, I think it's wonderful you've found a young lady willing to stoop to your level.
Oh, boy, I tell you, I haven't felt this good since I came up with that new place to hide my porn.
Hey, what do you guys say we take this party on the road?
Skinemax doesn't kick in with the really dirty stuff till about 3:00 anyway.
They had one on last night where the girl had a buttface but her breasts was immaculate.
Peter, you sure it's okay to beat the brewery after hours?
Besides, it sure beats the hell out of last Saturday when we partied with that big-horned guy from Legend.
Hey, you guys want to go to IHOP? Get some breakfast or something?
Oh, God, I don't know, Big-Horned Guy. It's like 3:00 a.m.
Oh, that sucks, man, I'm wide awake. Hey, Quagmire, you want to...
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. Are you okay?
If you were God, who would you strike down first?
What are you squinting about? It's not even that bright.
What we need out there now is another Tim Daly.
Is that the one where there's a guy and he's like, uh, he's a pilot or something?
No, no, it took place in an airport. Th-Th-The thing was on for ten years.
God, you know what? Screw you guys. I don't even know you.
All right, I want to be very clear about this.
You can meet her, chat for a minute, and that's it. In and out.
Oh, don't worry, Brian. If she's as ugly as I think she is,
I'll look at her once and then I'll go all over the place.
Now, why in the world would you be embarrassed about dating her?
I was watching something on TV about this guy named Hitler.
But a moron with large breasts you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars, or whatever it is grown-ups do with large breasts.
Say, Jillian, I love what you've done with the place.
So, Stewie. Do you work with Brian at the detective agency?
I know Brian's work has him coming and going at all hours of the night.
What are you talking about? I want some more of Jillian's delicious lemonade.
I just wish they didn't have to kill so many lemons to make it.
So, wait, Dupree moves in with Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?
Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning, I call my friend Cleveland and he describes every scene from You, Me, and Dupree.
Griffin, your workout put this week is even worse than usual.
Eh, it's this bum hand. I can't type with it.
I need to see some improvement by the end of the week or you're finished.
Oh, that's going to be Quagmire with Along Came Polly. I gotta take that.
All right, so as you know by this point in the story,
Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in and helping me get my work done.
Without you, Angela would have been all over my case.
I know it's tough for you to work with your hand injury.
Hey, you know, uh, with you sitting there, it's, uh, it's kind of like you're my secretary.
You know, Lois, if I'm your boss, I gotta look like a boss.
Finally, I have a reason to wear this big bow tie and cigar
Lois, take a letter. Dear Life Cereal, Where do you get off? Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious? Who do you think you are? By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically and have nothing but good things to say about what you do. Life Cereal, do not change a thing. Signed, Peter Griffin. Dictated but not read.
Oh, hey, Brian. Back from a hot booty call with your idiot girlfriend?
You know, think what you want, but you don't see the side of Jillian that I do.
Face it, Brian, she's dumber than a Boston-area book report.
The novel I chose to address is Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens.
For your information, Jillian is very bright and she happens to be a very talented photographer.
Every hot girl who can aim a camera thinks she's a photographer.
Ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On. You must be so brooding and deep.
Uh, a lot of things. Um... food, um... the new seat covers she just got for her Jetta.
Look, you know, I don't have to justify anything to you, all right?
All that matters is Jillian and I have a great time together.
But just tell me this, Brian : does she laugh on her own or does she laugh only when you laugh?
Uh, you gotta hit, uh, DVD and then menu and then select.
Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up when you put it in.
You should be able to see the words Mr. 3000.
Uh, so, yeah, um... so I figured we could get together tonight and maybe, um, do all those things sexually that we usually do.
No way, gross! Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, oh, no.
You know, I've been noticing you around the steno pool.
I think it would be so hot for you and me to have sex in my office.
Oh, my God. There is no way that is gonna happen.
You know, it's no wonder you're so far behind in your work if this is how you behave at the office.
Peter, no. I have work to do so you can keep your job.
Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. I'm a worker. I make stuff on things.
Oh, I'll file these later. Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it.
Geez, Lois, I thought having you here was gonna be fun, but so far you're a bigger buzzkill than Buzz Killington.
Oh, man, this is the best party I've ever been to.
I thought it would be very droll if we all sat down and looked at etchings.
Now, who here likes a good story about a bridge?
It was so nice of you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner.
Now, come here, Brian. Come sit by your friend, Stewie.
And then, think about this : have you ever seen the sun and the moon in the same place at the same time?
So tell us, Oogie, where'd you find this one, huh?
Well, hey, what are the odds of finding true love anywhere in the world says this observer.
I threw up a lot in high school, so I don't get my period anymore.
Wow, this is the one you've been waiting for, huh, Brian?
Because you don't know what two people are like when they're alone.
I don't know, I'm feeling kinda cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.
Do you think we should support what the president is doing?
Well, I just think, for starters, that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us and, truthishly, we should just accept that.
Do you know what the capital of this state is?
So then the valet pulls up and I'm all, That is so not my car.
Yeah, I tell ya, if I had a nickel for every time that happened.
What if you had a nickel for every time that happened?
Well, I was just saying I do my share of dopey stuff.
I attended a speaker's colloquium on federal judgeships and without realizing it,
Brian, why can't you just admit what's going on here?
Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. I'm gonna have to break it off.
But, boy, it's gonna be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin.
Blah, blah, blah, Lincoln assassinated, blah, blah, blah, tragedy for our Republic.
Morning, Lois, I need you to proof read this and collate it for me.
Peter, for the last time, I'm not having sex with you in this office.
Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to Penthouse Forum, and I don't wanna be made a liar in the nudie magazine of record.
If I give you 30 seconds of making out, will that shut you up?
Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week, and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office.
All right, Brian, you can do this. You can dump her.
Because once it's done, never again will you have to listen to her talk like this?
You know, where everything has a question mark at the end of it?
Well, uh, Jillian, there's... something we need to talk about.
I, uh... just wanted to spend some time with you.
What the hell? It took you three hours to break up with her?
What's that smell? It smells like sweat and anger and shame.
Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your maker at the hands of my cat launcher.
Hey, look, somebody tried to break into the dirty movie store.
Quick, grab as many as you can before someone sees us.
All right, cats, back in the bag. Come on, Fluffy.
Take two of these and call us in the morning.
Oh, my God, what are you kids doing? Out. Everybody out.
Now, if you're curious about sex, you should talk to your sex ed teacher.
We don't have one. The principal cut sex ed class to save money.
The kid in me likes the frosted side... but the grown-up in me likes the kid in me.
Peter, do you know they're not teaching sex ed at Chris' school?
Eh, let them figure it out the way I had to.
With a can of Crisco and a shot glass. That's the natural way, Lois.
Tomorrow, I'm going down to James Woods High and offer to teach the class myself.
Like I did when I taught money management to those drug addicts.
There's a lot of ways for you guys to save money.
For example, you're all shooting up, why not share needles?
That's a no-brainer. More money in your wallet, more drugs in your veins.
My second piece of advice : have as many kids as you can,
'cause that makes it more likely that one of those kids'll grow up and make it big in Hollywood.
Now, you've probably heard all those rumors that condoms make sex less pleasurable.
While that is a fact, they also make sex safer.
Lois, you think I'm going to miss a chance to share my knowledge with these fresh young minds?
Oh, boy. I am not going to hear the end of this.
I know I don't fit here, but I'm just going to settle right in.
All right, Peter, you can stay, but remember, this is my class.
Now, there are a number of natural ways that males and females interact.
I am all done writing plays for the day, perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?
I say, look at this. This toy has small parts.
I'm supposed to eat them. Of course, it all adds up!
If you put that under your pillow, the Tooth Fairy will come and give you a dollar.
To our house? She just breaks in like some hood?
Yeah, she creeps into your house at night and comes into your room while you sleep.
And sometimes, just for the hell of it, she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair and places it gently on your tongue.
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here!
Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's.
Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me again.
Fine, but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson when he tries to play an American cowboy.
That's none of your concern. You got to take care of the offspring.
Gonna take a fortnight at least to get this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.
This glen's gonna be tough to traverse, and that river's got to be 50,
To hell with parliamentary procedure. We've got to wrangle up some cattles.
We're all protesting the sex ed class that's being taught to our children.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class.
These students have the right to information about safe sex.
Can't you go down the school and try to reason with them?
Well, Lois, I think you did the right thing by trying to inform these kids about safe sex.
And if the parents don't like it, that's their loss.
That's the problem, though. It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.
All right, students, we have a special speaker today who's going to educate you about sex.
Please welcome from the First Evangelical Church, the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood and the Opal Ring Crusade.
I was just passing through on my way to see The Matrix.
Well, God, I am here to talk to these kids about sex.
Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.
Freeze! Now, who can tell me what Matthew just did wrong?
I mean, besides not running over that yahoo from Jefferson High.
He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex and he's not married.
He's sitting informally like us. Let's hear what he has to say.
Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it before you're married, even if you use a condom.
Because not only to condoms fail they're also majorly unsafe.
Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag over your grandmother's head, would you?
And that's why we're gonna be handing out these opal rings.
These rings are a symbol of your commitment to refrain from sex until you're married.
So what do you say? Who wants to be joyful?
Who wants to be pure? Who wants to be... abstinent?
I know, he's a visionary, like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.
Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up, but, watch carefully. If I move this down here, and this over here, and this part here...
Okay, well, what if I move this here and this here...
All right, men, your mission tonight is to stave off the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.
And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol since you have many faces.
You know, there's some carrots down at the other end.
She could have snapped my neck if she had a mind to.
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be a while before you lose another tooth.
I have to lure her back on my terms and kill her myself!
But to catch a fairy, I have to think like a fairy.
If you want Brian to say : Well, that'll be a stretch, text-message FAMGUY1.
If you want Brian to say : I'm not touching that one, text FAMGUY2.
If you want Brian to say : Arriba! and dance around a sombrero, text FAMGUY3.
Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring. It means I made a pledge not to have sex.
That's crazy! You can't give up sex. You've got a responsibility.
You see, Meg, you're what they call a practice girl.
Dad, look at the facts about sex. If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension populated entirely by dogs who will eat it.
Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything.
All right, getting a tooth to lure that damn fairy back shouldn't be too difficult.
Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take our relationship to the next level.
I know, I feel the same way, but we made a decision to be abstinent.
Of course, there are ways we could keep our pledge and still do other things.
You know, Roy, I hope you play squash better than you pass.
Here comes, Grimace. You got some burgers I can steal, huh?
It's all in these pamphlets Meg brought home from school.
Sex turns straight people gay and turn gays into Mexicans.
Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there something wrong with the Smucker's?
Meg, I still cannot believe what you and Doug did last night.
Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent, but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count.
Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.
Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade, and this is how we choose to express our love.
Look, Meg, A) ear sex is just unnatural, and B)... How do I say this?
Oh, when you rattle it around just right... oh, my God!
I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose?
In local news, a sexy new trend has emerged at James Woods High.
That's right, Tom. It appears that students have taken to having ear sex in lieu of traditional intercourse.
Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far, prompting a new slogan : Once you go black, you go deaf.
Brian, I'll be right back. I'm going to use the little girl's room.
And it turns out these teeth I got from the old man are phony.
I'm frequently aggressive in situations that don't call for it.
Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh... she has this eating disorder. She's bulimic.
I mean, her hair is falling out. Last week she lost a tooth.
But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging just makes her body look fantastic.
Karen Carpenter over did it, but I think Jillian's found a good balance.
I'm really surprised you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.
Oh, well, you know, I just wanted to touch base, see how everything's...
Just to check in, make sure everything's going well with you and Brian.
Just saying you look jolly, like Ruben Studdard or John Goodman or Santa.
No, I'm saying Santa's thin. Get in there and throw up!
Excellent. Now I'm prepared to fight the Tooth Fairy just like Gerri fought comedy on The Facts of Life.
Hey, Blair, did you find a purse at the mall?
Come on. Can't you break your stupid pledge for one night?
Wh-What are you doing? What? Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!
I am going to have regular sex with you whether you like it or not.
Hey, when'd you get that tattoo on your lower back?
I don't know, Peter. Meth is a hell of a drug.
I'm just glad to have you back on my side.
I only wish I could convince Meg and her classmates, too.
I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson when he apologized to the Jews.
But most of all, I'm really sorry about your dirty, underhanded, backstabbing ways.
No, way, man! How do I know you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?
You have a picture of Chris Noth in your wallet.
Stewie, this is ridiculous. There's something I have to tell you.
Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but, yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors just like Harry Houdini.
But I don't want to play bridge with the Petersons tonight.
I suppose that bile-spewing skirt of yours can have her tooth back.
Peter, how are we going to get past the guard?
He's tall enough for us to sneakin behind him. Come on!
And if you have sex, you're automatically in Al Qaeda.
Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't have sex until you're ready.
And if you do make the choice to act on them, make sure you protect yourselves, use a condom.
If we really care about each other, it's okay to have sex.
We'll be safe. We'll use a condom, and it'll be wonderful.
I just wish I could have been there to hear the speech you made.
If you want to hear Meg talk about her day, text FAMGUY2.
If you want to give Cleveland his first line of the episode, text FAMGUY3.
Coming up, a New Orleans man says his socks are finally dry.
But first, the big news in entertainment this week is the lovable child actress,  Olivia Fuller.
Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia from the performing arts school.
What sort of overblown contract has that dreadful bitch landed now?
Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.
No, but you can have some Tasty Juice. It has only one-third the sugar of soda.
But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins with today's announcement that Tasty Juice will be dropping her as their spokesperson and replacing her with a new ad campaign featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians, as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
Brian, we have to go down there this weekend and heckle her roundly.
I'll humiliate her worse than Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot.
The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye wamprats in my T-16 back home.
Hey, uh, can-can I talk to you privately for a second?
Well, you just kind of called me out in front of everybody back there...
Well, here I am trying to help you with something...
You know what, I don't need your kind of help, all right?
Lois, I don't understand why I got to sit through a chick flick.
Peter, you promised you'd come with me to see Autumn's Piano.
Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh.
Oh, my God, Sandra Oh. We loved you in Sideways.
I think about you while having sex with my wife.
I thank you with one dollar. That's a lot of money to them.
Lois, I'm just warning you, if this movie turns me gay, I'm going to start bringing gay guys home.
And I don't mean the classy maybe they are, maybe they're not gay guys.
I mean those big, Oh, my God, here they come, floatin' around, making noise gay guys, not the fix up your house gay guys.
We're your roommates : I'm Sassy, that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy.
Yeah! You can tell all the girls care about each other,
I have to leave, and I'm taking my piano with me.
Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has helped me understand a lot of things.
Like that foreign guy at work who helped me understand sarcasm.
So, he say this when your brain know is not really nice day.
Oh, boy, I am going to take her down right in front of everybody.
And now TV's Olivia Fuller will cut the ceremonial ribbon.
I hope I'm allowed to do this. My mommy says, Don't run with scissors.
She's so cute. I love children. Look at my kids.
So everyone feel free to browse and purchase from our fine selection.
Hey, Mom, now would be a good time to raise my allowance.
Stewie? Oh, my God. Wow, this is... it's been a while.
Yeah, no, it has. Uh, what, so you back in town?
Yeah, we're, um, we're moving back into the old house.
Oh, that's... God, you look great, I mean, you're all, you're all in shape.
I mean, I guess, I guess you should be looking good
Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over on Friday, it's my Bernie Mac night.
Um, i-it's a fun show if you haven't seen it.
I can't understand what the devil he's saying, but you know, there's a lot of movement, and it's bright and colorful, it keeps my attention.
Look, Stewie, you're sweet, but since I moved to Hollywood, I've done a lot of growing up.
I'm dating more sophisticated men now. But it was good to see you.
What do you care? You came here to gloat about her contract cancellation anyway.
Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face. I mean, she's a woman now, Brian. So sophisticated, so grown up, and she says she wants a grown-up man. But...
Hi, I'm the Mayor of Comedy here to tell you about a new CD offer :
Sitcom Punch Lines of the '80s. Including such gems as : and...
Order now and receive Sounds of the '80s Studio Audience, which includes...
Hear what '80s mainstay Howard Hesseman has to say about it.
Would Howard Hesseman lie for weed? We don't think so. Order now.
Yeah, hey, look at you, you just got out of bed.
She says she wants a more mature, grown-up man, so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.
Eh, not much, really. Just me and my pubes, ha...ngin' out.
Boy, I am so beat from doing adult stuff all day.
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was Bri?
Stewie, this is not going to convince Olivia that you're grown-up enough for her.
There's only one place in town you need to observe.
I don't want my neighbors seeing a fat, old, dirty whore screaming at me on my front lawn.
Why the hell would she respond positively to such a negative comment?
Brian, do women like it when you treat them like crap?
Well, I don't know if you want to be that black and white about it.
That's it, isn't it? Women respond when you treat them like crap.
Well, Olivia, prepare to meet a much darker Stewie Griffin.
Hey, babe. What do you say, we going out Saturday night?
I told you, I'm just into a different type of guy.
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what you're into. Being ugly.
No. If I was being mean, when you opened the door I would have said, Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia.
You see, I thought you were Ray Liotta because your skin has the texture of a decorative autumn squash.
My God, I'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials.
Oh, God, there is no (bleeping) drummer better than Neil Peart!
Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow is equaled only by your sense of love.
Peter, have you been up all night watching chick movies?
Lois, before I found these movies, women only made me cry through my penis.
Are you kidding? I got lots of experience in the film industry.
I know. I love coming here because you can just sit here and people-watch, you know?
Look at this. What is that? What is he doing?
Just standing there smelling his hand? What is that? What is that on my hand? Is that... is that barbecue sauce? When was I near barbecue sauce?
Yeah. Not gonna be so tough when the sun goes down, are you?
You know, Stewie, I'm really glad I gave you another chance.
No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that self-centered, but, you know, Olivia,
I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be than right here right now with you.
Oh, look at this guy. Now, there's someone who cuts his own hair.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, check out this uptight Asian guy, look at that.
Boy, this is a great city. I don't care what anybody says.
Yeah. Well, we should probably get home. This area gets really dangerous at night.
Okay, everyone, welcome to the first day of shooting for Steel Vaginas.
It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz, is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has uncurable chick cancer.
All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair and shoot this thing.
Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair. I need it to move.
Joe, get out of the damn chair. Chris, get the cattle prod.
Okay, now give him some peanut butter so we can make it look like he's talking.
Stewie, this is Victor. We did a Flintstones vitamins commercial together.
Victor's such a good actor. He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami.
Oh, hang on a sec. Uh, idea for a short story : guy picks his nose, then eats it.
Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia, why don't you and I go get some punch?
Oh, actually, would you mind getting some for Victor and me while we catch up?
Why doesn't Victor go get some punch for you and me?
Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor and go get the punch?
Or-or none of us could have punch. But still Victor could go away.
Uh, sure. Idea for a novel : guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.
It's unbelievable. I don't know where I get it from.
What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a jerk.
Oh, I'm acting like a jerk? What about Phony Curtis over there?
Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming out.
You don't own me. I can talk to whoever I want.
I, Stewie, take you, Olivia, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
Uh, what's that, Rupert? Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes.
Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh... it's been a long one.
No. No, it's nothing. Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night.
Oh, I don't know, Olivia. Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage.
That's not the poi... Don't change the... It's a kind of cake?
Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner?
Uch, some days I think it was easier being Q-Bert's roommate.
If you're gonna leave all those lights on, I'm not gonna split the electric bill.
Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet here took forever with her makeup.
Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip, but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel, so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.
But to his credit, it is a great spot to get mugged.
Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took all my money out of both our wallets.
Yes, about the same time you decided to hole up in the bathroom
I have a prominent brow, and I do what I can to get by.
Olivia, the three of us are having a great time. What's your problem?
And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze.
That's what it all comes down to, isn't it? I'm not grown up enough for you.
Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby.
What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?
No, I want to stay here and have my steak.
You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy.
Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy? Open heart surgery.
Oh! Is funny because open heart surgery not easy at all.
So, without further dudes, ah, let's, uh, watch this thing.
At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns, but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff, and before I knew Vageena Hertz.
When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to learn.
Push, honey! Hurry up and give me my baby boy!
But one day, Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a sandwich... and this happened.
We gotta get this woman to surgery time. Right stat now!
But it was too late. And she died from an angry hymen.
Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I ever seen.
Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.
You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood.
I mean, what kind of a man would I be If I ran off now?
Oh, Stewie! I thought you were at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom.
No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit. We had to cancel.
Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend?
No, about you stay here and I leave and never come back again?
But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear.
Idea for a farce : cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive.
Well, you wanna know what I learned this week? Being a grown-up sucks.
Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know?
Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that?
The only way they're not going to kill my sister is if we give them the stone.
Uh-oh, here they come. You'd better get in there, too.
Joan Wilder's sister is being held hostage in Cartagena, and there's not a policeman in sight. I guess it's up to me.
Our top story : Mayor West has dispatched the entire Quahog police force to Cartagena, Columbia, to assist in the rescue of fictional 1984 movie character,
Lois, can you run inside and get me some oranges or whatever it is these things eat?
This would be a giraffe, Issac Newton. I stole it from the zoo.
What with Mayor West sending all the cops away, everybody can do whatever they want.
Like yesterday, I started a lovable gang of cockney pickpockets.
All right, boys, the best targets are old, rich people.
I hope you don't find the money strapped to my thigh.
Peter, you take that thing back where it belongs immediately.
All right, I guess we gotta go back to the zoo, Allison Janney.
You're not the same giraffe from last night. Get out of here.
Brian, are you coming over to watch Laguna Beach tonight?
There's a dance Friday night and no one wants to go with me.
Um, I heard you didn't have a date to the dance, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me.
I have to go to my little brother's funeral that night.
Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone to go with you.
I'm gonna kill myself 'cause no one will go with me.
All right, all right, Meg, look, what if I... what if I drove you and walked in with you
I have to buy a new dress. All the ones I have make me look fat.
The story on everyone's mind continues to be the absence of police officers in Quahog.
The police are gone? Oh, my God, we're finally safe!
Freedom you see has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about, you owe it to yourself to check it out
Hey, Joe, where you been? We haven't seen you in days.
The only reason I didn't have to go myself is that South America isn't wheelchair accessible.
Hey, you guys, we should help Joe out. We could be cops, right, Joe?
Well, we have started an emergency training program at the Police Academy, but I'm not sure that you're cut out for the job.
Besides, it's bound to go better than my deep-sea training.
Excuse the hell out of me for trying to brighten your day with music, all right?
Oh, man, we're going to need some butter or something.
Oh, Brian, it is so nice of you to take Meg to this dance.
Here she is. Brian, I present to you your polished turd for the evening.
FYI, the carpet matches the drapes in color and length.
Man, I got to tell ya, I can see why you'd be insecure, Meg.
Are you drinking so much because you don't want to be here?
You know, the best thing about these girls is, even if you're terrible, they don't know the difference.
You know, Meg, there's no dogs allowed here, so you're going to have to leave. But Brian can stay.
You know, Connie, I think I have a theory about why you're such a bitch.
No, no, no, no. Now hang on... hang on, Meg, hang on.
You see, Connie, you're popular because you developed early and started putting out when you were 12.
But now you can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror because all you see is a whore.
So, you pick on Meg to avoid the inevitable realization that once your body's used up by age 19, you're going to be a worn-out, chalky-skinned burlap sack that even your step dad won't want. How's that? Am I in the ballpark?
You know, you don't deserve all the crap you get, Meg, you know that?
Now we can do this one of two ways. I can bust your balls to pieces right now, or we can spread it out over the course of the day.
I thought maybe we could go get some coffee later.
But... no, no, no, look, look... I got stuff to do today.
Well, she seems to have taken a shine to you, Brian.
With a little encouragement, you might get her to put her cankles behind her ears.
Look, it's not that big a deal, all right? We just... we just... made out a little.
It didn't mean anything. I had a few too many and... it's not even worth going into.
This is even a bigger jackpot than when the Emperor figured out the formula for great Star Wars dialogue.
Well, this is it. Our first day of Police Academy IV.
We're going to start by learning how to do a cavity search.
Peter, you will be the police officer and Quagmire, you will be the suspect. Begin.
Sir, I suspect you are in possession of drugs, and I'm going to have to give you a full cavity search. Drop your pants.
Uh, Peter, you don't have to pull your pants down.
I never knew how flat and wide your tongue was.
You know, I thought about how you stood up for me at the dance, and all the nice things you said.
I saw this penis on the Internet today and I thought to myself : Well, that's...
Maybe you can come and help me pick out some underwear.
I don't think that's gonna be a possibility. I have... plans, um... with Chris. Chris and I have plans this afternoon.
We're doing... what you usually do on a Thursday afternoon.
Well, maybe back to back, but I gotta tell you I'm not 100% on this.
Hi, Mom. Is it cool if Brian and I go to the mall this afternoon?
Ever since that dance, you two have become such good friends.
Right, Meg? Come on. Let's go to the mall. We'll get ya... get ya a big ol' pretzel.
Uh, Meg, can I talk to you for a second?
Look, this has gone a little too far. I like you. I think you're great, but what happened at the dance was...
What? No! I mean, yes, that's how I would know you're interested, but
Meg, the fact is that you and I are friends, and that's the way it needs to stay.
Good. I'm gonna grab Stewie, and then we can go.
Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all right about out little talk the other day.
Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. And... hey, look, I wanted to thank you for being so great to me.
Ooh, you got some pie, huh? Can I have a piece?
You're saying it weird. Why are you putting so much emphasison the H?
What are you talking about? I'm just saying it, Cool Hwhip.
You put Cool Hwhip on pie. Pie tastes better with Cool Hwhip.
Well, Lois, I am now a graduate of the Quahog Police Academy.
I can't believe I'm married to a big, scary police officer.
Hey, uh, Lois, can I talk to you for a second?
You're telling me. She's been locked in her room all day.
Yeah, well, the thing is, Meg is becoming a little enamored with me, and I'm kind of losing control of the situation.
Oh, she's just grateful you took her to the dance.
And that part I can't stress enough. That's a great shirt, by the way.
What the hell is wrong with you, you sick bastard?!
Look, the short version is, this morning, she made me eat the hair in her pie.
No, it's not what you think. Stewie had some, too.
I don't know what the hell happened between you two, but you'd better go upstairs and straighten it out right now.
This is even worse than when you ate that bubblegum out of the garbage.
Look, you obviously didn't hear me yesterday, so I'll explain it again.
And here to assist me is headmaster of the New York School
Joe, I gotta tell you, this whole cop thing ain't as exciting as I thought it was gonna be.
I like to watch her strip and pretend she's a woman who I've never met, but who looks just like Bonnie and lives in my house.
Peter, I haven't seen Meg or Brian since last night.
Mom, is it bad if I saw Meg tie up Brian last night, put him in the trunk of his car and then drive away?
I have just been buried in paperwork for the past 72 hours.
Oh, my God, Brian was right. Meg really must be obsessed with him.
Don't worry, Lois, we're the police, and we'll do our very best to find Brian and girl Chris.
I'm not gonna lie to you here. I'm a little uncomfortable.
Oh, just relax. We're gonna be here for a hwhile.
Come on. That one doesn't even have an H in it.
Yeah, Brian, you're doing the same thing that Mia Farrow did to that Oriental guy that Woody Allen brought home from the circus.
Peter, hold on to that thought, because I'm going to explain to you when we get home all the things that are wrong with that statement.
I've never been more certain about anything in my life!
Meg, I know that's what you think right now, but you're...
Hi, Mr. Quagmire. Mom said I should come over here.
Meg, I've watched you grow up from a playful little girl into a very special young woman.
Now you probably just think of me as square old Mr. Quagmire from next door, but I've been around the block a few times, learned a couple things, and I can tell you this, there's no reason to grow up too fast.
I can see why a relationship looks glamorous, but you've got all the time in the world and a lot of wonderful experiences ahead of ya.
This book helped me when I was about your age.
It let me know that as long as I kept on rolling,
I'd find that one person who would make me whole.
Coming up at 11:00, Quahog police return to active duty after giving up the search for fictitious Romancing The Stone character
Plus, in national news, America's scoutmasters are asking : Why are the kids so shy in the shower?
Yeah, I've had a lot of good times with this thing.
You got anything you used to wear in the summertime?
Brian, where's Rupert? I just left him here to watch my things.
What if he's dead? I don't think I can handle a funeral.
Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.
I bet I could do a wheelie with these! How much for the gloves?
Sucker. I would've gone to $15, easy. I am so stupid.
Peter, you can't drive the car over that. You're gonna get hurt.
Lois, I don't come down to Burger King and tell you how to do your job.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have some death to defy.
This is just like what happened with Matthew Broderick, except no one's dead.
We got reckless driving, disturbing the peace, plus the driver of one of the other cars was a virgin whose hymen was busted by the airbag, so rape.
This is in poor taste, Peter. You're starting to piss me off.
Aw, man, this sucks. I got no license. I can't go anywhere.
Well, this is your own fault, Peter, and if you want my opinion, a little time away from the bar will do you some good.
That show stopped being funny after Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.
Ah, man, now I can't even watch TV. What the hell am I gonna do all day?
Don't even remember sleeping with that lady, but I did.
Why have you brought me to the toy store, Brian?
And if we buy it, they save a real gorilla in the wild.
And if we don't, they kill one. Wow, these guys are playing hardball.
You can't just take some Korean-made velveteen primate and call it Rupert.
Now come on, this is all time we could be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.
Look, I, uh... I may as well come clean with you.
Come on, Stewie, I'm really sorry. It was an accident.
What you've done is more horrible than sex with Sharon Stone.
One minute I'm filling up at Chevron, and the next I'm having sex with Sharon Stone.
All right, all right! Geez, Lois, I'm just trying to amuse myself, since I don't have a damn driver's license.
Peter, it's getting a little annoying having you around the house all the time.
So you'll be happy to know I got you your own personal driver.
My own driver?! Holy crap, that's awesome! Where is he?
Yeah, Dad. I don't mind driving you around till you get your license back.
Well, it was either Meg or a talking monkey smoking a cigar, but I didn't you'd like that.
Lois, you picked the opposite thing that I would like.
I've taken DNA from the dollar bill you were paid for Rupert.
Oh, I heard you. What I didn't hear was, Please.
If I enter Connecticut, I'm entering every state that Connecticut's ever been with.
I say, what a bit of serendipity. Now we've got that fellow's address.
Well, you can forget that. We're not going all the way to Aspen.
For the rest of my life, I'll be as lonely as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell after the rapture.
Damn it, Jerry, why are we the only ones still here?
Look, Stewie, don't you think, at some point, you're gonna have to let Rupert go?
I mean, you are getting a little old to have a teddy bear.
Look, I'm not going to Colorado. I'm turning around and going home.
Fine, then, I'll go by myself. See you from the back of my milk carton.
Want that on your conscience, Brian? Try explaining this to Lois.
You'll wind up in a Dumpster with a bunch of slow, unadoptable greyhounds.
Don't joke about that. That's like the Holocaust to us.
Yeah, well, when greyhounds start running The New York Times and the World Bank, I'll be more inclined to believe you.
Take to the highway Won't you lend me your name...
This sucks. Can you believe I'm stuck with Meg driving me around?
Thanks for the ride, Bandit. Good luck tapping some of that hot, hot Sally Field tail.
Knock it off. I don't like it any more than you do.
All in pursuit of the ideal that no man should be subjugated because of the color of his skin.
I'm just sayin', make it worth our while, you know?
We wrote a pretty big check for you folks here, so, um...
You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine. Doesn't matter. Just, uh... I...
Just hope you're making the best of what we gave you here.
I would say that, given the events that preceded it, the couple hundred years or so, maybe we're about even.
Queen Latifah or Halle Berry, but she's been dead for six hours?
If we wanna get to Aspen, we're gonna have to get over those mountains somehow.
Excuse me, uh, how much is it to rent a helicopter?
It's ten bucks an hour. But there's a $100,000 deposit.
Wait a minute, it says here you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.
Well, this rental agreement was drafted back when musicals were culturally relevant.
Well, I can prove to you that's a whole lot of nonsense.
You may think that song and dance is dated boring and dry.
<>But you might just learn to like it if you give it a try.
You could laugh and sing and dance as gaily as an elf.
But just in case you don't believe me, ask the man himself.
Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains are the same color as the sky.
I said, be careful 'cause the mountains are the same color as the...
Imagine the dance I'm gonna have to do to get our security deposit back.
Well, looks like you're gonna be reunited with Rupert after all.
And just in time, too. I can't keep my teeth from chattering.
I got these at Jack's Joke Shop in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.
Aw, you should've seen what our amazing, freakin' daughter did to that guy, Lois. She kicked his ass.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't you talk to her like that.
Meg's as cool as the other side of the pillow.
Welcome to the cool side of the pillow. You've had a hard day.
Rest that weary head of yours and drift on off to dreamland.
I accidentally sold you a teddy bear back in Rhode Island, and...
I'm sorry, but that bear belongs to Timmy. Now, please leave.
First one down the mountain wins. If I win, I get Rupert.
If you put peanut butter anywhere on your body, he'll lick it off.
She danced close to me like I hoped she would.
You know, Dad, it's been really great hanging out with you.
I know there's probably a million things you'd rather be doing.
Are you kidding, Meg? I've had more fun with you than I did going to see Lost in Translation with Cleveland and Quagmire.
Look, I know sometimes I give you a hard time.
You know, calling you names, reading your diary, farting in your cereal when you go to get milk and then laughing : Ha-ha ha! She doesn't know she's eating my fart.
Peter, good news. Your suspension is up. You can have your license back.
So, I guess this means you don't need me anymore.
You'll probably go back to treating me like crap, huh?
Well, maybe just to keep up appearances in front of the family.
You know, peer pressure and all that. But from now on, Meg, you and me are secret best friends.
What I want is a fresh glass of better daughter!
Stewie, do you really think you can beat this guy?
Trust me, Brian, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.
And now I just sit back, relax and watch my progress.
I don't know, Brian, maybe this is a sign that you were right.
Hey, dog, let's go. My dad won you fair and square.
Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car right now, man!
I'll fucking kill you! Get out of this fucking car!
I decided I want a big party this year with all my friends.
I don't know. She have her period or something? She getting married?
No. If she was getting married, we probably would've seen a guy around, right?
Oh, my God, it is! Peter, we got to put together a party!
This is gonna be worse than that time I was stuck behind Robert Loggia at the airport.
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia. R as in Robert Loggia, O as in Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia, B as in By God, that's Robert Loggia, E as in everybody loves Robert Loggia, R as in Robert Loggia, T as in Tim, look over there, it's Robert Loggia, space, L as in Look, it's Robert Loggia...
It's an invitation to Meg's party. I'm the party planner.
You have to RSVP. You can do it right now if you want.
No, I'm not gonna pick it up on the first few rings. I'm busy.
Hello, it's Mrs. Pennyapple again. Shall I put you down for two, Brendan?
Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake, and the guy wants to know how old Meg is. I didn't know what to tell him.
I thought you were the one keeping track of that.
Don't you remember me faking my way through her last birthday?
Hey, maybe we should just cut off her leg and count the rings.
You know, we're gonna have to talk to her and kind of steer the conversation in a way that gets her to spill it.
Meg, that kind of language is not appropriate for a girl your age.
All right, come on in, everybody. Have a seat anywhere.
So the man asks the bartender to recommend a good drink.
The bartender says, A Grasshopper. So the guy orders a Grasshopper.
Then he's walking home and along the way, he notices a grasshopper on the ground.
So he says to the grasshopper : Hey, you know there's a drink named after you?
The grasshopper says : You mean there's a drink named Irving?
So which one of you wants to lose your virginity?
I mean, balloons? Pin the tail on the donkey? I'm not five years old.
Meg, your father worked very hard to put this party together.
I'm an adorable tramp who wears found clothing and eats out of your garbage can.
Peter, I don't think you're actually supposed to swallow those.
Are my long john stied to the end of those?
Stewie, what are you doing?! You can't open Meg's gifts!
Oh, God, not the mine phase. I've been dreading this day.
Especially after I got shafted by that Asian Santa at the mall.
Ah, Dad, you won't say that when you see my grand unicycle finale.
In the meantime, I leave you with the musical stylings of Chris Griffin.
Dad, I'm so sorry I broke all your ribs and busted your spleen and punctured your lung.
I don't if you can hear me right now, but
All I wanted was for my dad to tell me he loved me.
Well, I hate to side with your father, Peter, but you do kind of drink a lot, and, you know, sometimes it affects the people you love.
Well, from this day forward, I, Peter Griffin, will never drink again.
This isn't exactly a good substitute. Where'd you get crack?
Right behind Black's Hardware Store. There's a white guy selling it.
You need to get to the heart of why you feel the need to drink in the first place.
Look, here, this is the number of a hypnotherapist I want you to see.
Peter, just thought I'd check on you. Oh, my God!
This is mine, and this is mine, and that's mine, and this is mine.
Oh, what's this? Hot Monogamy, the board game for failing marriages. Dare card : Have her do a strip tease and see how long it takes you to get a bonner.
Stewie, I have had just about enough of this new selfish attitude of yours.
Stewie, honey, I am so sorry. Are you okay, sweetie?
I haven't been this scared since Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.
Okay, now let's go back in your mind to your childhood,
Lois came at me like a wild animal. I had no way to defend myself.
Oh, it was awful, Rupert. I felt terrified and brutalized and humiliated and... and... and alive.
My God, I... I haven't felt that alive in years.
Rupert, you know, I think perhaps I may be one of those people who...
I promise I will never lay a hand on you again.
Well, let's not make any rash decisions. I mean, I did provoke you.
Come on, Lois, hit me! Beat the crap out of me! Step on my cubes.
Oh, hi, Peter. Are you here to bring back the TV set?
No, I sold it for crack. But listen, Mom, I've got to ask you something.
I knew this day would come. All right, Peter, here it is.
About 40 years ago, I was vactioning in Ireland, and I met a young rogue named Mickey McFinnegan.
All I know is somewhere in the great land of Ireland, is a big fat bastard who looks like me.
Call me as soon as you can, Peter. And I really hope you find your real father.
If I can just get her to hit me one more time, it'll give me the rush I've been looking for!
What's next? What's next? Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty, and I need to be taught a lesson and you're the one to do it.
Yes, I made you take time out of your day to clean my mess
Don't you think you should spank me or slice my nostril?
Look! I've drawn heavy weight pugilist David Tua on the wall.
Sweetie, you've really gotta stop... huh, looks like David Tua...
You really got to stop misbehaving. You're getting on Mommy's nerves.
Well, you know what'll ease your stress? Slap me across the face like a bitch!
Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my eye, violating me with a wine bottle.
You know, Ireland has more drunks per capita than people.
I don't think the Irish drink as much as people say they do.
Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the hills are green, the streams are clear, and the sweaters are so thick, even the boniest-fingered nun could poke you in the chest and it wouldn't bother you none.
Don't be so bold with your dark hair and your proud ways!
Have I heard of him? Of course I've heard of him!
Oh, my God, you mean he's the disgrace of the whole town?
Top of the morning, ladies! Let me cut you an Irish rose.
I don't know exactly where the county Cork is but I know where it should be!
Around here, the town drunk is a person of great honor.
Listen, uh, this maybe hard for you to believe but...
Yeah, I came all the way from America to find you.
I suppose it's money you're wanted. I owe you some allowance and so forth.
Oh, no, I don't want money. I just want to get to know you and be friends.
So I can finally have a real dad who loves and respects me.
You can't be me son. You and me are nothing alike.
Who's leg do you have to hump to get a pint of Guiness around here?
Boy it's amazing, isn't it? You get two fathers and neither one of them wants anything to do with you.
There's got to be some way I can make him see that I'm worthy of being his son.
About the only way I can ever impress him is if I was a fat stinkin' drunk.
Yes, from was he told us. That's right on the money.
Wait a minute, Brian, that's it! I'm a fat stinkin' drunk because my father is a fat stinkin' drunk. I gotta prove it to him.
I have gotta drink him so far under the table, he'll have no choice but to respect me. Get me a beer, Brian.
I am going to prepare for this as thoroughly as
Wow, I got to be Henry VIII in twenty minutes!
And what makes you think you can hold your own with the *likes* of me?
Let's drink until the alcohol in our system destroy ours livers and kills us.
My God, nobody's ever beat me at the game of drink.
Nobody but a McFinnegan could handle that much of the creature.
You're the broth of me own stubby shillelagh, all right.
I'm a McFinnegan now! I can forget all about Francis.
Francis may not have been your father, but he raised you as if you were his own. And if that isn't love,
You knocked up my mom and never called her again.
He doesn't smell like Irish Spring And he never taught me anything
But still I slap my chest and sing of my drunken Irish dad
His face looks like a railroad map And he never shuts his freakin' trap
But all the ladies catch the clap from your drunken Irish dad
All feel the same mixture of pride and the shame
We Irish lads are all infirm And our moods infect us like a germ
Peter, are you sure you're allowed to bring a baby onto the golf course?
Well, Lois asked me to watch Stewie for the afternoon.
It's all right, I don't think the club will mind.
Will you please hurry up? It's 100 degrees out here.
Oh, the gift basket was not worth the trip, not by a long shot.
Oh, I got to get that. I'll talk to you later.
Every hole... that's a joke that just doesn't get old!
Come on, Glen! Come on, get your head in the damn game!
Hey, do you think it's time to talk to Quagmire about his anger issues with this game?
A white man shouldn't play sports in the first place.
Hey, Quagmire, you know it's not fun when you're like this.
Sorry, Chris, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to cancel my subscription.
Listen, I think you're a real nice guy, but I've just decided to go with another paper.
I see you're wearing your big shorts with the baggy leg holes that flutter
Thank you. Would you like to come inside for a cupcake and a glass of wine?
We now return to Cutting in Line in Front of Italians.
Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate yourself to the back of the line with your feet and stand there with your shirt?
Well, Lois, you tied my golf shoes a little tight before I left the house.
Had to deal with that all day. Thank you very much.
You know the sun is dangerous for a baby's skin.
Peter, this is more irresponsible than when you fed your mogwai after midnight.
Peter, didn't the little Chinese man tell you not to feed him after midnight?
I'm a young Eartha Kitt. President Johnson, bring our boys home from Southeast Asia.
Chris, what do you need money for? Isn't that why you have a paper route?
No, this new kid named Kyle keeps stealing all my customers.
Oh, that's terrible. You're a wonderful paperboy, Chris, and you need to remind your customers of that.
Are you having a bully day? I'm having a bully day.
Hey, what do you think of my recumbent tan pose?
Legs probably spread a little wider than they ought to be, but who gives a damn? This is just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.
Well, listen, it was wrong of you to steal my customer away from me.
Boys, boys, we can settle this like reasonable and sexy teenagers.
Remember, you had a bully, too, when you were his age.
Yeah, you're right. Randy Fulcher used to pants me every chance he got.
Peter, I think one of us should go over and have a talk with Kyle's parents.
I'll do it, Lois. Right after a healthy breakfast of juice, toast and store brand imitation frosted flakes featuring Terry the Tiger.
Hey, ladies, you mind if I park here? I'll only be a few minutes.
The kind of mustache that says, Yeah, I've been nude on camera. What of it?
Now I know what it feels like to have dinner with Martin Landau.
And pedophile or not, he, he was a perfectly professional person.
You know my wife and I are very involved in Planned Parenthood.
Oh, just a few friends over to enjoy this gorgeous weather, and maybe take a dip in the pool. Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.
Yeah, it, uh, stars a little actress named Joan Van Ark.
It's essentially Brokeback Mountain from the point of view of the horses.
Hey, the sun's been up for an hour. Shouldn't we get riding?
Listen, apparently your son got into a little scrape with my kid.
Would you mind if I had a word with your son?
That's not very nice. I don't sound like that at all.
Listen, I just want you to know what you did the other day was wrong.
You're not making this easy, Kyle. My name's Peter Griffin.
Might be some problems later, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Well, maybe you should have just had an abortion, Lois!
Would that make you happy if I was never born?!
See, you wouldn't know that because you're white as a ghost.
Uh, hey, buddy. I was just coming to tell ya it's time to get out.
I've been in there for six and a half hours, you son of a bitch!
Kyle's mother agreed not to press charges if you apologize.
Now why don't you patch things up with Mr. Griffin by showing him your Legos?
You know what, Lois? They are not the same thing.
And the sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.
By gluing many razor blades to this ordinary desk fan,
You don't have to apologize. I would have done the same thing.
You know, I always used to be the nerd getting bullied, but doing it to someone else was pretty sweet.
And the more you do it, the sweeter it gets.
What's wrong with me? You're the one punching yourself in the face.
Hey, Lois, how come you keep punching yourself in the face?
I'm just glad I stopped before I did any real damage to my skin.
Of course, your sunburn was pretty bad. I suppose it could be... the C word.
What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Well, the mole looks benign, but we won't know for sure whether it's cancerous until the tests come back in a few days.
He said it looks benign. We'll just have to wait and see.
Jim Henson had a wait-and-see attitude and look what happened to him.
Oh, that's no problem. I could cook you something. You want some spaghetti?
'Cause there are two kinds of people in this world, Chris.
Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy. They will do what you want because they know, they know what you want.
Oh, oh, oh, don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
My point being that I'm a bully, not a nerd.
Brian, I may only have one week to live and I've got to make the most of it.
Now, I've made a list of things I want to do before I die and you've got to help me since this is all your fault. Visit Chicago Museum of Art.
Next on your list, you want to learn to ballroom dance.
All right, if you're gonna make me do this, at least let me lead.
You are no different than that bully who used to pick on you.
There's one more thing I need you to do before I die.
I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision, but when I try to look at you, you scurry away.
Why only when I ignore you do you return to the center of my eye?
Wait, wait. Look, there's no reason we can't finish the memoir anyway.
Chris, I'm gonna show you how to stand up to a bully.
I'm gonna beat ya, and then my son Chris is gonna beat ya.
This guy's got a monkey scrotum and he's bragging about it.
But you wanted me to learn to stand up to a bully.
I thought it'd feel good to be a bully, but all I did was make people feel as bad as Randy made me feel.
As long as you promise never to bully anyone again.
I mean, you know, unless I get really stinkin' drunk, in which case all you got to do is outrun your sister.
Oh, I like that. That's nice. That's a warm family moment.
You know you're a redneck if you come from a rural area and behave as such.
These men and their redneck lifestyle really speak to me.
Not like the last time I was at a comedy club.
I hear this guy's hilarious. He played Kramer, you know.
Peter... what the hell are you doing with a pickup truck?
This is because of the Redneck Comedy Festival, isn't it?
Peter, you can't suddenly decide to be a redneck just because of some show.
Lois, those men showed me the way to an identity
I am going to do everything a redneck is supposed to do.
This is going to be more painful to watch than when he ate half a Fudgesicle in one bite.
Dad dragged it out on the lawn, 'cause he said that's what rednecks do.
Meg, I'm a redneck, which means I am about to do something to you that you will not remember until you're 40.
We now return to Carl Sagan's Cosmos, edited for rednecks.
Scientists believe it's four bil hundreds and hundreds of years old.
- Jesus. ...aurus Rex, it's clear, by the use of carbon-dating that...
Peter, you painted over the back window. Isn't that dangerous?
We like people driving behind us to know what our beliefs are.
How the hell am I supposed to get to the airport?!
Oh, I can drive you. I got a pickup truck. See?
They're tagged! They're tagged! Just get me to the airport.
That's all the motivation I need to actually do this.
Thanks, George. You want to say that one more time without the sarcasm?
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is your captain, Glenn Quagmire.
The flight's going to be a little longer than we've expected.
Secure your own mask first, and then assist the child!
Even though oxygen is flowing, the bag may not inflate!
Sir, we have a confirmed crash. Flight 37 is down.
We'd better alert the mayor. I'll have to interrupt his photo op.
My Pet Goat. Page one. You know, said my pet goat, I'm sure, if I watched Grey's Anatomy, I'd like it, but I just don't have the time. You should make the time, said the farmer.
Our top story : There was drama in the skies of Quahog today, as a Trans National 767 was forced to make a crash-landing.
That's right, Diane. As if the world weren't already scary enough, it seems you can't even get on a plane safely these days.
However, using state-of-the-art Channel 5 computer technology, we'll show you how disastrous it could have been.
Here's how it would have looked if the plane had crashed into a school.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies but one passenger had survived, gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.
You'd have to be made of stone not to feel saddened by that.
No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to siphon jet fuel from an active runway with the intention of flying a pickup truck.
Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble, but my redneck days are over.
No more crotch shots of me getting out of a car.
I got enough in my savings until I find another job.
Yeah, and there's an annoying little homo screaming in my kitchen.
Oh, great. This is gonna be worse than the time I lived with Marlee Matlin.
Oh, come on, Marlee, I know you can't hear them, but you got to feel those things slapping out of there!
Listen, I really want to thank you guys for taking me in in my time of need.
Aw, forget it, Quagmire. It's the least we could do after what happened.
There's no one here by the name of Longrod Von Hugendong.
What if we had two calculators and we put them next to each other?
He's been living with us for over a month, and I think it's enough now.
Lois, I'm the whole reason he lost his job and his house.
Besides, I can't throw my best friend out on the street like a prom night Dumpster baby.
Hey, what are you doing out here? Don't you want to dance?
My fanny needs a blanket And somebody to spank it
Well, you're gonna have to help him find one, because I've had enough of him living in this house.
Hey, uh, just an FYI, really no reason to go into any greater detail than this.
I really liked that job working on the Starship Enterprise.
Dude, you got to introduce me to that black chick.
Guys, the only thing I know how to do is fly a plane.
And I'll never be happy unless I can do it again.
Okay, guys, let's go over the plan one more time.
Quagmire will pose as an airline passenger on the 6:00 flight to New York.
Then Joe and I will sneak into the flight attendants' lounge while Cleveland distracts the security personnel.
Cleveland, Joe and I will board the plane posing as flight attendants.
At which point, Quagmire is forced to step in and land the plane safely, making him a hero.
Boy, this sounds like more trouble than a moose on the interstate.
I'm trying to get a couple of bucks for something to eat.
I could have sex with you or I could just stand over there and drink from the lake.
All right, I'm gonna go bring the pilots their coffee.
Hang on to something, 'cause this ride's about to get rougher than dating a hot girl with a bad laugh.
Ma'am, I hate to be a nuisance, but your son stopped kicking the back of my chair.
Both the pilots are unconscious, and we're in a nosedive.
If only there was someone on board who could save us.
I said if only there was someone on board who could save us.
I know you have a choice in airport sex, and I appreciate your choosing Quagmire.
Please exercise caution when standing up, as the contents of your panties may have shifted during coitus.
All right, I got a plane to catch. Say, which gate is flight 209?
That plane's going down! My friends are on that plane! They're all gonna die!
More trouble in the skies over Quahog tonight, as a Trans National jet is apparently out of control.
Channel 5 has this exclusive recording of a mayday communication from the cockpit.
Ah, who the hell am I kidding? I don't deserve to be a pilot.
No. I was gonna, but I ended up getting laid instead.
That reminds me of a guy you might've heard of.
He said : You know, I've got a 13-inch member... and Glenn Quagmire is the best damn pilot I've ever seen.
You bet he did... right before he died a very painful, AIDS-related death from having unprotected sex with so many people.
Men, we're doing everything in our power to get you down.
Now I want you to listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
Take a firm hold of the throttle, and pull the red mixture knob out slowly.
All right, now do you see a button that looks like a drunken gay guy eyeing you from across the bar?
Recently discharged pilot Captain Glenn Quagmire is apparently talking the plane down.
Coming up : Why calling every Asian man you meet Chung King can land an anchorman in hot water. After this.
All right, Peter, slide the red knob all the way out.
And the second those wheels touch the ground, you hit the emergency brake.
Well, guess there's nothing left to do but watch the end of Last Holiday.
Yeah, guess it didn't take too much for you to get your job back,
I don't even mind that I was raped in a federal prison after I was arrested for hijacking.
You put yourselves on the line and you gave me my life back.
This was such a great idea for a weekend activity.
Well, I thought it'd be good to get out of the house.
I don't like the kids being around that racist sunflower that's growing in our yard.
Hey, look, kids, it's a recreation of the lost city of New Orleans.
Dad, was there ever a real city of New Orleans?
I should be more reluctant to take my clothes off, but I'm not because my stepfather had boundary issues.
I see you got two eyes but not much else.
And a couple of eyebrows with one raised up like you're saying, Say what?
Ah, it was nothing. That's how I caught old Woody over there.
In other news, former president Bill Clinton was in town today to judge Quahog's annual Miss Cankle USA contest.
Where does the calf fat end and the ankle fat begin?
I am sick of you using the front yard as your bathroom.
It's time you learned to use the toilet like everyone else.
Well, it's just that whole thing at the aquarium made me realize
I mean, what if I run into that octopus again?
Come on, it's all you, it's all you, it's all...
Will you guys quiet down? I'm trying to concentrate on my cardio.
We'll start off your workout with vigorous calisthenics executed in rhythmic time with acetate pressings of the new musical craze called jazz.
Look, Lois told me I had to start using the toilet and you're the one who's had potty training, so
Maybe that's where the wizard lives who operates this thing.
Brian, be careful with that. We don't know what it does.
I'm just writing a letter to my boyfriend. Dear, my boyfriend, Thank you for making out with me recently on purpose. That was cool. Those flowers that you totally sent me were really pretty, just like you said I am. Love, Meg.
Meg, you are so full of crap. You're like those people who sit in Starbucks and publicly write on their laptops.
Yeah, setting up in public so everybody can watch me type my big screenplay.
Me, too. All real writers need to be seen writing,
Peter, you've been to the gym once... for 15 minutes.
I'd rip a phone book in half, but for the life of me,
I don't know anyone who uses a phone book anymore.
He looks more pathetic than John Merrick when he went on Match.com.
I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger without the fruity accent and the Pirates of the Caribbean wife.
Excuse me, sir. Secret Service. I wonder if we might ask for your assistance.
It seems he blew a tire in front of your house.
Would you happen to have a jack we could borrow?
We're a little overloaded 'cause I'm having a fat chick party back here.
First one to have a bead of neck sweat reach their butt crack wins.
The key is to put it all in your groin and your back.
Lift with your lower back in a jerking, twisting motion.
All right, so which one of y'all ain't got my herpes yet?
You know what the worst part of it is, Lois?
I thought I was just out of shape, but that ain't it at all.
I got to face the fact that I'm just getting old.
Well, I felt so bad that Peter hurt himself fixing my car,
I wanted to stop by and extend my good wishes.
Hey, can I get a picture of you on my cell phone?
It's just that I'm starting to realize I'm not as young as I used to be.
After my bypass, I remember wondering if it was all downhill from there.
I don't know, Reagan, I wish I could believe that.
When you get out of here, I'm going to take you out and show you the time of your life.
I promise you're going to feel like a young man again.
Since I couldn't help you learn to use the toilet, I found something that can.
And today we're going to learn to use the potty.
Remember, it's all about relaxing and letting your body do what it does naturally.
All right, Peter, we've got a big day ahead of us.
I'm going to show you that age is just a state of mind.
You shouldn't have talked, you stupid bitch! I hope you die!
Boy, that, uh... that wasn't really a crank call, that was...
Ever since you and I have been hanging out, I feel 20 years younger.
See, I told you, Peter, age is just a state of mind.
It would be so easy, man! It would take, like a minute.
Peter, that pig... could be in our stomachs in, like one minute, and then we could... and then... and then we could do other stuff.
If he wanted a pig, why didn't he just take my wife?
You do not go on this lawn! Brian, I've had enough of this.
It's more disgusting than when you gave me that Christmas gift.
Oh, Brian, this is disgusting! Oh, my God! Get it out of here!
I'm... I'm sorry. I thought... I thought you'd like it.
Brian, if you're not going to use the toilet, there's only one solution.
Brian, did you know that Brad Pitt is John Lithgow's nephew?
But doesn't that sound like something that could be true?
People see my diaper, and they say : Oh, how cute! I bet he smells like baby powder.
They see your diaper and think : Ew! That dog is sick. He must be dying. I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet. Why don't they just put him to sleep?
Oh, hey, come on, man. You just got to get used to it.
You know, you should be more sensitive to my humiliation.
Remember how bad you felt when you drew that picture for Peter and Lois?
It's like we have a little Michelangelo in the house.
I almost lost it when you said to put it on the fridge.
I know! What the hell is this supposed to be, a pelican or a school bus?
Oh, boy, a pig! Can we keep it? Ow! It bit me!
What the hell did you and Bill do last night?!
Peter, that former President Clinton is nothing but a bad influence!
Not like you, with your Judd Hirsch sweater and your bag of Werther's Originals.
If he won't listen, I'm just going to have to go talk to Bill Clinton myself.
Mr. President, I need to have a word with you!
Hey, you want to give me that cigar. I'm ready to smoke it now.
What the hell was I thinking? I-I don't know what came over me.
I swiped some money out of Lois's purse. I don't think she'll notice because she's here humping you?!
Look, I know this looks bad, and I feel horrible, and
I know nothing I could say to you could possibly justify why I slept with Bill except...
I mean, Peter, the man presided over the longest economic expansion in US history, and he reduced the percentage of Americans on welfare to its lowest level in 33 years.
Apparently, there's the side of Bill Clinton the world knows, and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side only I know.
Lois, I think maybe it's better if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.
I've been a worse wife than Lorena Bobbitt when she was married to The Thing.
Oh, my God! Where is it?! Where did she throw it?!
Look, Peter, I know this is a very difficult time for you, but I want you to know I'm here for you if you need anything.
Quagmire, I know your heart's in the right place, but
I haven't misjudged someone this bad since my last physical.
But I think I've got a solution that will make things right for both of us.
Well... the way I figure it, the only way to even things out between us is if you have sex with someone else, too.
Whoever it was said some very sexual things. Some very angry, sexual things.
Well, that's the thing. I mean, there's only two phones in the... well, in the world, and one of them is in my office, and the other's in your office, and those two didn't even exist until about a few hours ago.
As it yields to the sound of your heart beating
All right, Peter, who's it going to be? Who do you want to sleep with?
Who we kidding, Lois? This is never going to work.
Deep down, in your heart of hearts, if it could be anyone in the world, who would it be?
It was my understanding that there would be no questions asked.
I haven't been so struck by a woman's beauty since I was Uma Thurman's eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.
I have no idea what you're going to say to me.
So you can go ahead and say what you're going to say, and my natural response could be to get offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I wouldn't have kept my promise.
Well, we were in the neighborhood, and Peter said, Let's stop in.
You know what? Daddy's right. Let's go upstairs where we won't bother him.
Wish I could talk to ghosts. That would be sweet!
Well, Peter and I have hit a snag in our marriage. I won't go with the details.
But it turns out that the only way to make things right seems to be...
Carter's been most insufferable lately, and this would just stick in his craw.
I like your freaky spirit, but it's your craw I'm after.
He won't even look me in the back of the head anymore.
I can't do it! I can't go through with it!
You have to, Peter, for the sake of our marriage!
And I don't care that you slept with Clinton. We'll get past it somehow.
Well, Peter, our marriage has suffered a serious trial, but
In the meantime, I guess I better clear the air with Clinton.
Hey, listen, Bill, uh... you and I need to have a talk.
Well, look at you, using the toilet. I am so proud of you.
Well, you deserve all the praise for encouraging me to do it.
You don't know what it's like to grow up the way I grew up.
You know what? How dare you?! You don't know me.
You have no idea where I come from, where I've been, how long I've been there, what I had to do to get from where I was to where I am now!
Oh, of course, there's one in the den. Help yourself.
Hey, Mexican Superman, can I talk to you for a sec?
When you signed the lease, you said there was going to be like five of you living here.
Oh, no, they're not all living here. They're just visiting.
Lois, I'm tired of Mort always mooching off us, so I made a scare-Jew.
Peter, we're not gonna have this in our front yard.
It's racist, and for God's sake, you ruined your best suit.
Now we're gonna have to get you a new one...
Well, since you keep ruining them, I'm not going to buy you a brand-new one.
Yes, I'll take this teddy bear, this ruler, this piece of string and this cardboard box.
Well, I guess I can still play with it three weeks out of the month.
Say, you look like you could use an activity book with half the activities done.
Ha! More like set the book down and have a beer.
See, they've got a flap that opens up in the back.
Are you telling me I could be pooping and warm?
No longer would I have to make a choice between the two.
Sir, here is a check with my name on it.
Write down any number on this piece of paper, and I will pay it.
All right, so we roll the dice and then we both have to yell Yahtzee really loud.
My God, Peter, you wore those pajamas to your office?
Hey, at least I'm mixing it up a little bit.
Oh, boy does it feel good to undo my butt flap.
Ew, Dad! We don't want to sit here and look at your ass.
Yes, I'd rather look at Meg toweling off after a shower when she does that butt floss thing.
Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever accidentally use that towel.
Lois, I have never been more comfortable as a person than I am in these feety pajamas.
This is what it feels like to be a bear.
You remember what I used to say, Lois, when we first got married?
You remember? I used to say : What would it feel like to be a bear?
You can wear them to bed, but tomorrow we're getting rid of them.
Your pajamas created a charge of electricity when you dragged your feet across the carpet, and when you touched Chris, you passed it on.
I got to tell you, you're pissing me off worse than when I watched the O.J. verdict with my old roommate.
We the jury find the defendant Orenthal James Simpson, not guilty...
Peter, if you shock me, I swear to God I'm leaving you.
Well, there's a Quonset hut that I've never seen in this room before.
I could be in that New York style magazine kiosk.
Glen, thank you so much for helping me tear up my carpet.
Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess, when you called me I sort of misunderstood what you were asking for.
Well, it's fine, it's fine, whatever, I'm happy to help.
Since you won't get rid of those pajamas, I'm getting rid of the carpets.
Hey, Lois, you want me to leave a little strip in this thing?
I can finally afford that operation to swap my vocal cords with Patrick Stewart.
Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon making a list of famous Armenians.
Peter, you've been sleeping with that money for the past week.
Don't you think it's time we did something with it?
And I said, I wonder what it would be like to be a bear?
No, no, no, I'm talking about that dream we had, Peter.
Remember? We tried to open that restaurant, and we never quite got it going.
Yeah, we got shut down 'cause of my exploding cupcakes.
Mmm, I hope these taste as good as they look.
Oh, this is going to be the coolest place in Quahog.
All the movers and shakers and bigwigs are going to eat here... but not the small wigs.
Oh, God, I'm so nervous. I hope it goes well.
Oh, yes, I'm sure it will go as well as Liza Minnelli's Playboy shoot.
Hey, Lois, Diamond Jim Brady over here just asked if we accept the Discover card.
You know, you know, I would rather take two live chickens than your fly-by-night credit card.
I would rather take a jar of pennies that's value was less than that of your bill.
You are going to sit there and listen to the funny things
The guy at table 7 complained there's not enough juice on his prime rib.
Oh, look, it's one of those early Maude episodes with the really long opening credit sequence.
Except for that one time when she didn't come back
But still found a way to keep herself looking fine
You and I own a restaurant. Can you believe it?
That means I can do whatever I want without consequences.
I just finished going over the books, and this restaurant is hemorrhaging money.
This place is like a ghost town half the time.
After all, I'm the only one in this family with any business experience.
All right, Violet and Pigpen, you've been seeing each other a few weeks now. What seems to be the problem?
I keep getting bladder infections, and I don't know why.
I even hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct my TV commercial.
'cause it turns out M. Night Shyamalan was involved with September 11.
You know, Peter, my buddies and I have been looking for a new hangout.
Bunch of cops in uniform hanging out in my restaurant?
But how can you leave me now, Ben Stiller, when I need you more than ever?
Now it's time for me to go help another child.
I guess I just fooled myself into thinking you'd always be with me.
Lois, roll out the red carpet. Here comes Joe and his cop buddies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe! I thought you were bringing your cop friends over.
Oh, God. I hope there's not one of those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys with the bandana on his head. Oh! There he is.
Uh... Lois, uh... aren't you a little freaked out by this?
I don't care about that. I wanted a cool restaurant, not the cafeteria at the veteran's hospital.
This is weirder than that rap video by M.C. Escher.
And going up the stairs and going down the stairs
And, in local news, a new restaurant is taking Quahog by storm.
That's right, Diane. If you're handicapped, or know someone who's handicapped, or just happen to be a fan of the circus, then come on down to Big Pete's House of Munch, where the elite without feet meet to eat.
Lois, this is insanity. I think we should shut down the restaurant.
Lois, let me explain something to you, all right? Cripples are not cool.
A picture of Mark Harmon, the greatest actor who ever lived.
I know what you're thinking. Peter, this is just like your Gil Gerard speech.
And you can stop right in your tracks, because it is not.
Granted, it is similar to the Gil Gerard speech, but it...
Peter, I like our restaurant the way it is, and if you don't, that's your problem.
Oh no, you're not, Joe. We have a new policy.
I don't want you and your kind eating here anymore.
You're ruining what was supposed to be a cool establishment.
Are you... you telling me that you have a problem with me being handicapped?
As a matter of fact, Joe, yes. I think it's immoral.
Yeah, when you're not drinking and gambling on your reservations, which we gave you.
Fine, if that's the way you want it, but we're not going to go down easy.
Peter, we'll give you one last chance to let us in!
What are you going to do, Joe? I'm up here.
No, Peter. I heard what you said about my movies.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid he'll never walk again... without remembering how lucky he is that he'll only be in this wheelchair for two weeks.
Peter, you do realize you deserve this for the way you treated Joe.
It ain't my fault that him and all his gimpy friends don't fit in with regular society.
I'll be a dignified cripple, and I'll show them all how it's done!
And it won't be long before you and me run
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues.
I thought you and your friends were just a bunch of gross cripples, but I've been in a wheelchair for 45 minutes now, and I see how tough it is.
Well, Peter, it's been a rough week for both of us, but it means a lot to me to hear you say that.
So what do you say? Can we put all this behind us?
Hey, Bonnie and I are watching Grey's Anatomy if you want to come in.
We now return to Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Now It's Just Getting Sad.
My character is a therapist living in the city, but I'm married to an elephant.
We're going to my parents' this weekend. Did you pack your trunk?
I don't think I want to go. I don't like going to your parents.
See, there's a lot going on here. A lot going on.
Really? Wow, you know, that sounds like it could be a lot of fun.
Yeah, it's been a while since you've had the chance to play in public.
When was the last time you were changed, seven days ago?
That's one week. There are seven days in a week.
Well, I don't know if I can compete with the rest of these people, but here goes.
My word, what a fascinating man this Jesus must have been.
Well, finally! Some of us have been waiting all evening for a certain wife to come home and feed her starving family.
Peter, I told you I was going to be late. Couldn't you have handled dinner?
That's like asking me to choose between Sarah Jessica Parker and Kirsten Dunst in a hotbody/weird face contest.
It also means that this family is going to start going to church again on Sundays.
Being there today reminded me of how important religious services are to the moral fiber of a family.
Ever since she started smoking pot, she just kind of lays there.
Oh, my God, I think I'm getting a contact high.
A reading from the letter of John to the couple with the crying baby upstairs. Obviously you hearyour kid crying and you're trying to break him of some habit. But I got news for you. It's not working. I swear to God if it doesn't stop,
I will come up thereand show him what real pain is.
Youse is good church going folk. Y'all deserve a little treat.
Now I can do what I planned to do this morning...
You know, all I wanted was for us to share a simple Sunday church service as a family.
We're here to take custody of your baby so that the good reverend here can perform an exorcism and banish the devil from his infant soul.
What?! You are not performing an exorcism on my baby.
Mrs. Griffin,you can give him to us, or we can take him by force.
Don't worry, Lois, we'll hide in the one place they can't find us.
In Imagination Land, where you burp where you fart, and you fart where you burp.
Who cares as long as it's away from those bloody church fanatics.
We can stay at my sister Carol's place until this blows over.
Texas? We're going to Texas in search of religious tolerance?
That's going to be like trying to get Sneakers O'Toole to take his sneakers off.
I'm not taking my sneakers off I am Sneakers O'Toole.
I'm not taking my sneakers off I am Sneakers O'Toole.
Authorities are on the look out for one-year-old Stewie Griffin, a Quahog infant who is believed to be possessed by Satan.
A substantial reward is being offered for any information leading to his capture.
In other pseudo-scientific news, a local man claims to have spotted bigfoot.
I was about to bone my girlfriend out at the lake, but suddenly she yelled, so I looked up and it was bigfoot.
Then I went back to bone her, but the mosquitoes were going crazy, and she said there was no way.
All right, get your snacks and hurry out, you guys.
What a God-awful mess those things are, chocolate with raisins in it.
Yeah, yeah, that's what kids want with their chocolate-- fruit.
Why don't you put sunflower seeds in the Ding Dongs while you're at it?
Pardon me, sir. We're trying to locate a possessed child.
He's actually inthe mini-mart right now. He'll be out in a second.
I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no. Never seen him before.
Oh, I was just saying that baby in the picture is my son.
We're trying to avoid being found by police like you.
I mean, I was just remarking what a nice tie you have on.
Oh, did you hear that cashier's accent? Would you like some change please for you?
Oh, you know, if it weren't for 9/11, those guys would be adorable.
We're going to have to come up with a way to change your appearance.
I'm already standing in urine, and I hate the person I'm with.
No, see, there's got to be something in here we can use.
Are you sure Aunt Carol won't mind us using her house?
She won't care, Chris. She's off on her ninth honeymoon.
Nellie here is a homemaker. And I'm a queer chaser and beater.
Lois, I'm not sure this is the right place for us.
These Texans are socially backward and, politically, they're all stubborn as a mule.
I don't have to look it up. It's common knowledge.
A needle point of Chuck Norris from Walker, Texas Ranger.
You know, they say Chuck Norris is so tough there's no chin under his beard.
You know, this place may be the upside to everything that's happened.
The people are kind and generous. They seem whole some and moral.
Lois, we're living in a red state with a bunch of right-wing nutjobs.
At the top of the news tonight, authorities have called off their pursuit of a fugitive Rhode Island baby who was thought to be possessed by the devil.
This turn of events came after Vatican scientists announced today that the devil is not the greatest threat to salvation due to last week's discovery of the Superdevil.
Well, let me try and give you a clear picture of what we're dealing with here.
Here's a photo of the devil, and here's the Superdevil.
Now, as you can see, there are some significant differences.
The Superdevil is at least six inches taller, he has a flying motorcycle and a jar of marmalade that we believe forces you to commit adultery.
Looks like we all got something new to be afraid of.
Aw, just that I think you're going to love this cake.
None for me, thanks. It's going to go straight to my vagina.
Chris, we're in Texas now. If I'm not riding a horse,
I'm going to stick out like a straight guy in a figure-skating competition.
Hey, you want this? Huh? You want some of this?
I'd motorboat that. I'd motorboat the hell out of it!
Is that like a special you have on now or something?
And, at the top of the second half, it's 16 to nine.
But is having this minor skill worth being so unattractive?
Lois, I cannot believe you would ban the horse from our bed.
He is a graceful, majestic creature who is a part of this family and only wants you to love and respect... The horse may have pooped in the bed.
I hereby call this meeting of the Texas Youth Club to order.
Wow! This is the coolest club I've ever been in.
You got to sneak on to the Crawford Ranch and steal a pair of George Bush's underwear.
And then bring it back here so we can bask inits Bushy goodness.
Boy, that's even kinkier than the porn they make for senior citizens.
What is this? What the hell are we doing here?
A first-class ticket to a semen-stained death in the basement.
Why don't you meet the other contestants while I go register you?
I sing, I do gymnastics, and I can play seven instruments at the same time.
I'll give you 18% of my foot in your ass.
He's already got his sugar cut up into neat little lines for his breakfast tomorrow.
I can't believe Mrs. Bush kept all these Planned Parenthood receipts.
Holy cow! She's been scraped more times than a fisherman's knuckle.
You tell Javier to back off. I'll have his money by next week.
I was here for 12 weeks. I had to do something.
But, along the way, I learned about honesty, integrity, and cold filtered Miller Genuine Draft.
Can you explain how these cheers and jeers work again?
Well, the cheers is when they generally approve of something on television, and jeers is when they find some sort of fault with it.
I can't come over. We're still on the run because the town thinks Stewie's possessed.
No, they don't. Didn't you hear? They stopped chasing you weeks ago.
Hey, guys, thanks so much for inviting me out today.
Here you are, Peter. All fired up and ready to go.
Back where I'm from, a retarded guy could never have this much fun.
I always thought I'd die having to sit through the Canadian Film Festival.
I don't wish to cause you any harm, and I won't.
Now the final contestant for our talent portion of the competition,
Hey, Lois, great news. We can go back to Quahog.
I know, Brian. Shh! We're about to see if Stewie won.
Wait a minute. You... you've known for weeks, and you've been lying about having to stay here?
Which means that Miss Stephanie Griffin is our new Little Miss Texas!
You know, I wanted us to live in a place with real family values.
But values don't come from where you live or who your friends are.
I agree, Lois. Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that, you're an idiot.
Maybe you should take responsibility for what values your kids are getting.
Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves.
Oh, Barney, I'm never going to meet the right girl and get married.
You know, Ted, don't you think it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s to always be talking about getting married rather than getting laid?
All right, come on, everyone. Go get dressed. It's ballet night.
And with a name like The Nutcracker I thought, Oh, this will be worth a few yuks, but no, Lois, that title wrote a check that those queers on stage refused to cash.
Well, we're not the first people to be dragged off against our will.
Damn it! I swear to God I will turn this ship around!
You know, Meg, female ballet dancers are famous for anorexia and bulimia.
And, uh, it seems to work out for them, so... hintity, hint-hint.
So, uh, you kids develop any good pot connections at your school yet?
Lois, we'll be right back. Meg's gonna take me outside to poop.
Yeah, I got dragged here by this broad I'm trying to screw.
Look across at the other balcony. I can see you.
Oh, my God! What do we do?! What do we do?! We're both here.
Oh, my God! We should text each other! Hang up! Hang up!
Chris, how many times have I told you no reading during meals?
I have a history test today, Mom, and I couldn't study last night because you made us go to the ballet.
Well, Chris, you're not gonna learn any history from this. This textbook is from 1948.
Let me see that. Israel, the brand-new country everyone's gonna love.
What the hell? Are the schools so underfunded that they can't afford text books from this century?
Well, I am going to raise hell about this at the next PTA meeting.
Well, let me know if you need help. I can be very persuasive.
They can take our lives, but they can never take our freedom!
Let's not forget the tax they levied on properties that are in abutment of church lands.
For our first order of business, we'll go to Bruce.
We gonna have a puppet show. We gonna have some jazz.
I'm just a little excited 'cause I met somebody today.
Someone who likes the same kind of literature as I do.
The school has gone too far with these budget cuts.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but the No Child Left Behind law cost us our federal funding because our students' test scores were too low.
They cut a school's funding if it's got low test scores?
This is not what the founding fathers had in mind.
Okay, we're here to sign this declaration of our independence.
Well, somehow this school needs to raise its test scores right away.
I suppose there is one thing I can do to raise the school's test average.
But if I leave now, I won't hear who's the dumbest kid in the school.
After all, I taught Cleveland how to make Jiffy Pop.
So do you think your school would be right for Chris?
Quahog School for the Deaf has great programs, both academic and athletic.
In fact, you're just in time for our homecoming pep rally.
Our curriculum consists of being on boats for long periods of time with men, just men for many days at a time.
Up on the deck with lots of men or down in the galley with lots of men.
Well, a certain kind of pirate. Yes, we've been called that.
You know, I have to admit I've always been a little worried about Chris, but
I guess I just convinced myself things would work out for him, but with no education, what kind of future can he possibly have?
I mean, it's not like the high school will take him back.
You know what? I-I just... I hope I didn't hurt you.
No, no, no. I... I'm all right. I'm all right..
But listen, you know what? Let me make it up to you.
Why don't you let my wife and I take you out to dinner?
You know, I drive by this place all the time and I've never been inside; isn't that funny?
Y-Yeah, you know, Nicole and I came here by accident.
W-We had reservations at another place and they... right, right, honey?
Yeah, they couldn't seat us for like an hour, so we ended up coming here
I can see why. I mean, th-that halibut was... that, may have been the best halibut I've ever had.
Well, glad we talked you out of the pork chops, huh?
No, no, no, no, no. I'm taking care of this.
My food was more expensive. I feel bad. If I...
And every other school we've tried just doesn't seem to be a good fit for Chris.
Daddy, there's something I need you to do for me.
Chris got expelled from James Woods High, and, well, I was wondering if you could get him into that fancy boarding school you went to.
He has to shoot and starin' a shot-for-shot remake of Liar, Liar for my amusement.
I didn't fasten my seat belt. I didn't look in my rear view mirror.
I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.
I changed lanes while running a red light and speeding!
Boy, a degree from here would set you up with any job you wanted.
Perhaps one day I could be more powerful than King Friday.
I am the supreme ruler of the Neighborhood of Make Believe.
What kind of freakin' king lives next to the train tracks?
Oh, you must be our new dorm mate. I'm Rogers Chapstick, heir to the Chapstick fortune.
And this is Virgil MasterCard, heir to the MasterCard fortune.
Um, oh, dear. Johann tells me your luggage is the luggage of the poor.
I still don't fully understand! ...and that was the third time I slept with Katherine Harris.
Well, I love her politics, but how is she in bed?
Well, as anyone in Florida will tell you, she knows how to rig an erection.
One time I picked my nose and I swear I could feel the bottom of my eye.
I'll call Daddy and I'll see if there's anything he can do.
This is where the most powerful men in the world are groomed for their futures.
The Skull and Bones Society has been a part of my family for decades, and we want you to become a member.
Excellent. You get your own stock portfolio, a percentage of the 9/11 Victims' Fund,
Good. Why don't you try putting some weight on it?
Oh, look at my tiny dog. I'm gonna put it in my tiny purse.
Well, looks like we're all gonna have to take second jobs.
I guess I'll see if I can get my old gig back selling buttscratchers at the ballpark.
The first Thursday of every month we go to a local orphanage, pick out a kid, fill out all the paperwork and then don't take him home. It's hilarious.
Come on. Come on in. Your family's waiting in here.
Okay, I guess you don't want a new family, toys, and a puppy.
Chris, I'd give you a hug, but I'm exhausted from working two jobs to pay your tuition.
You got an extra job just to put me through school?
Well, once again, Meg, I'll be back in an hour.
And I got a job following fat people around with a tuba.
The Skull and Bones elders are now ready to admit you to our ranks.
As is customary with all our new members, you now have to spend seven minutes in the closet with our most senior member.
You know, Grandpa, I don't think I want to go through with it.
We all had to do it, Chris. Now get in there.
No, I mean, I think I want to go back to my old school.
My family's working so hard to pay my tuition here, and I feel bad.
Is there any way you can get me back into James Woods High?
Well, I suppose I could pull some strings if that's really what you want, Chris.
Sorry? You better get your ass in that closet, Pewterschmidt.
I didn't really fit in there anyway. The rooms were only 15x20.
If I didn't learn to laugh at myself, I'd be dead right now.
Why don't you take your stuff up to your room, Chris?
Family Guy It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One www.forom.com
Now remember, kids, when we get to Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch anything before I have a chance to disinfect it.
Boy, it was nice of Quagmire to let us use his place.
This'll be much better than that vacation we took with the Price Is Right yodeler.
There's no way that microwave cost more than 300 bucks.
Just be careful 'cause they got a lot of big ol' wilderness bugs out here.
Y'all best be careful or I'm gonna sting you with my stinger.
You know what? I'm not gonna sting y'all after all.
I'm just gonna head on over to that flower and suck on that stamen like there's no tomorrow.
Brian, how many years have I been saying you and I should go berry-picking?
Wait a minute. Do you know where we are, Brian?
All right,here's a little tune inspired by one of the great legends of the Old West.
Well, there once were two cowboys all alone out on the trail.
And when he woke up in the morning, she was still in his bed!
And he said, Oh,I don't have time. I've got a meeting at 12:30.
It's, like,a half-hour commute. And she said, I don't mind. It's on the way to my kid's preschool.
Hey, hey, Lois,look at me. I got post partum depression.
You son of a bitch, don't even joke about that!
Oh, my God, what the hell is wrong with this lake?!
So they can just dump their waste into the lake?
What kind of world is this where you can't even trust the oil companies anymore.
I just used to think... he was kind of funny. We should, uh, we should get to the hospital.
Mom, how long do we have to wear these wigs?
Oh, I don't think it's so bad. I feel rather like Mozart.
The Quahog Oil Refinery is emptying all their toxic waste into the lake.
I mean, you couldn't possibly have sanctioned that kind of blatant industrial pollution, could you?
And in return, I get free oil for my hair.
Hey, baby, want to take a gander at some Adam West penis?
Well, I am not gonna stand by while you let this town be destroyed by corruption.
Next election,I'm gonna run against you and I'm gonna win.
All right ,Mrs. Griffin, you want to take me on? Fine.
But if you plan to beat me, you'll have to...
With incumbent Adam West squaring off against challenger Lois Griffin.
Which leads many political analysts to ask the question, Can a woman really be mayor, or will she just menstruate all over the city? Stay with us.
Oh, you guys,I can't tell you how much I appreciate all your hard work.
Hey, Lois, take a look. I just made 500 T-shirts that say...
Chris, why don't you put these upstairs in your closet so we don't lose them?
Of course, he hasn't been as evil since he became a Jehovah's Witness.
Hi, I'm going door-to-door to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin who's offering real change for the city of Quahog.
Mayor Adam West has widened his lead over challenger Lois Griffin.
I'm confident that the people of Quahog will make the right choice.
And here to help me secure the Latino vote is actor Jimmy Smits.
Adam West likes to eat food that's grilled in foil.
It's probably gonna be decided by just a couple of votes.
And here we are sitting here like a bunch of lazy, paraplegic cops.
Guys, I need you to help out on the campaign.
Oh, man, that's like making all, like, signs, and walking around or what?
You know, you bastards got a stake in this, too.
I mean, Lois is my wife, and if she's the mayor we can pretty much do whatever the hell we want.
Meg, sweep that up. Get-Get a broom, sweep that up.
Sweep that up. Put it in your room, but sweep it up first.
All right, all but number two are free to leave.
Ma'am, I know that you're going through a difficult time right now, but I just have a few more questions.
Are you aware that Lois Griffin has a plan to cut property tax in half over the next three years?
What does that have to do with what happened to me?
Well, you say number two did it, maybe I say I smell alcohol on your breath.
Hi. When you go to vote for mayor tomorrow, please vote for Lois Griffin.
That's right. I work at a deli and I know baloney.
And that's exactly what you'll get with Mayor Adam West.
Boy, you guys,I really appreciate all the help you've been giving us.
Lois is gonna get the entire female vote 'cause of me.
I've been having sex with every woman in town nonstop for the past two days.
He's all alone in there and he's scared, all right?
Welcome, Quahog, to the town hall mayoral debate between incumbent Adam West and challenger Lois Griffin.
We will now open up the floor to questions from a community at large.
Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel about those computer websites that put a blue square on the home of a sex offender?
Well, the safety of our children is a very important part of my plan for Quahog.
No, no, no, no,I'm not impressed. I'm not impressed, not yet.
Mayor West, if reelected, would you increase the frequency of garbage pickup?
Well, citizen, that's an excellent question and I thank you for it.
I think it's great we live in a town where you can ask questions.
Oh, I like him. He looks me in the eye.
I'd like to have a beer with him. I'm voting for him.
He didn't even say anything and they're eating it up.
Lois, undecided voters are the biggest idiots on the planet.
Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan to do about crime in our city?
Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans for cleaning up our environment?
Well, the election results are poring in and it looks like it's gonna be a tight one.
Which reminds me, Diane, when's the last time you... aw, forget it.
The last of the votes have been tallied and we're getting the final results in now.
Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian, but mostly I'm excited about all the good I'm gonna get to do.
And the first thing I'm going to do as mayor is clean up Lake Quahog.
Well, I know the people will support you, Lois, because you connect with them.
And I think we all realize the importance of stopping the environmental damage being done to Lake Quahog, which is why I'm proposing a very modest tax increase that will help us to...
No, no, no, that's awful. No, no, no, I'm not okay with that.
Hitler is plotting with... with the Legion of Doom... to assassinate Jesus... using the lake as a base.
Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of dropped the ball on that one.
Darth Vader tried to buy yellowcake uranium... from unwed teenage mothers.
I threw a ten. See that ten there? I threw that.
At the top of the news, Lake Quahog is once again clean, thanks to the efforts of newly elected mayor, Lois Griffin.
We now go to Asian reporter, Tricia Takanawa, for her slant on the story.
Once again, happy locals are frolicking in the waters of Lake Quahog.
Sir, how does it feel to have the lake back?
I feel like I can once again take pride in my community.
And if you look around, I think even the wildlife is starting to come back.
And, you know, that's something we haven't seen in a while.
I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that.
Mom, everyone on TV says you're running the town great.
Maybe you can do some damn laundry once in a while.
Well, don't tell anybody, Brian, but I was a little naughty.
Wait a minute, you used taxpayer money to buy yourself a handbag?
Besides, there was a lot left over after the lake cleanup and I figured maybe I earned a little treat, huh?
Lois, spending even one penny of that money on yourself is incredibly unethical.
My God, that's more than I spent to go see that prizefight in Vegas.
I thought you said we was going to see Hairspray.
Bitch, I thought I said just shut up and be lookin' fine.
Oh, wait, wait, it was John Belushi, that's who I wanted.
Way ahead of you, Brian. My mistake, I'll take care of this.
Don't ask me how he did it, but Jim Varney got the shotgun!
Do you think you can give me a little mayoral discount?
Well, I think you're doing a great job, Mrs. Griffin, but my boss would kill me.
All I ask in return is that you let my company do just a little bit of dumping in your lake.
This guy don't sit right with me, Lois. He don't sit right with me.
Ugh, Brian's gonna be really upset when he finds out.
Eh, I'll just take him for a ride in the car, he'll forget all about it.
Wait a minute, I know where we are. The park is near here.
We're near the park, Lois. Oh, that's the tree. I peed on that.
Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois. There's another dog in that car.
H-Hey, hey, hey! There's another dog in that car. Hey!
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Quahog Oil Refinery, we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin for our newest waste pipe.
Hey, Jake, how long can you hold your breath under water?
You better play ball, or we'll find someone else who will.
You know what, West? You can have your job back.
Good for you, Lois. You wised up before it was too late.
I became the very thing I set out to destroy.
There. Now no one will have heard him say that.
Cleveland, it was amazing. You know what I discovered last night?
Yeah. I mean, it's only visible if you're looking from exactly the right angle, like the entrance to Hogwarts.
These are the only people I get to party with.
I like having a family. I got all the crazy out of my system when I was 18.
Except for that time I rode the mechanical bull at that bar.
What I wouldn't give to be 18 again, like those kids on spring break.
Grim news from Daytona, Florida, where the remains of three female college students were found near a local nightclub.
Reports suggest that all three were violated sexually before being brutally murdered.
I never like to be too far away from Mike Wallace.
Could you let me go back in time and be 18 again?
Oh, my God, this is... this is Newport Country Club!
All right, now I want you to meet me at this address in an hour, and we'll slap five there.
I figured Scott Baio was androgynous enough that we could both fantasize about him, and no one would be gay.
Lois, we got the rest of our lives for me to not hear a word you just said, but tonight, I got plans with Cleveland.
Could I Wham my Oingo Boingo into your Velvet Underground?
Peter, you're the one from the future. You should know... Ah, forget it.
Oh, you've got to hear this new Eddie Murphy cassette I bought.
Yeah, I've logged a lot of game hours on Menstrual Ms. Pacman.
You mean that quintessentially '80s guy with his collar turned up all the way?
Wow, you're the biggest star in the world right now.
Oh, I like to hook up with random bar guys.
Good to meet you, Molly. I'll be back later for your career.
It was even better than the time I stumbled into that fat, lonely women's club.
Uh, excuse me, could I get directions to the Providence Civic Center?
Well, Rusty, looks like we're gonna eat our way out of another jam.
Who the hell are you?! What are you doing in my bed?!
We've been married for 20 years. What's wrong with you?
Brian, Molly Ringwald is in my bed, and she says she's my wife!
You know, where the woman wakes up in the hospital, and all the doctors are pigs?
It's possible that when we went back in time, we somehow altered the past.
Geez, Brian, that's more ridiculous than the theory of why Tom Cruise runs in all his movies.
I'm gone for one night, and you sleep with Quagmire?!
Mr. Griffin, what I do with my husband is none of your business.
Hope you and Molly can still join us for dinner tonight.
We were only in 1984 one night, and now everything's all messed up.
Here's where you met Lois, here's where you got married, and here's the present.
Now, at some point during that evening, you did something that changed the course of your history, causing the time line to skew off into an alternate tangent, where you're married to Molly Ringwald,
Quagmire's married to Lois, and for some reason, we have a chalk boarding the living room.
We got to figure out what happened at this point in time.
You ever hear the theory that if you kill a butterfly in the past, it can drastically alter the present?
Oh, God, Brian, we messed up bad. We messed up real bad.
Don't freak out like you did when your goldfish died.
Hey, did you guys hear on the news about President Gore hunting down and killing Osama Bin Laden with his bare hands?
I know. Who would've thought Bin Laden was hiding out in the cast of Mad TV.
We're the ones who were meant to be together. Not you and Quagmire.
It's a little late for that, don't you think, Peter?
I mean, there was a time back when we dated that I thought you might be the one, but as I recall, you were more interested in partying with your friends.
When he kissed me that night at the Country Club Dance,
I love all your sex jokes and your dirty puns.
We've got to get Death to send us back to 1984 again so I can undo what I did.
We could kind of just take that one and call it a win.
I mean, with Bush, we didn't have flying cars that run on vegetable oil.
You are not taking my whole wallet so you can go shopping.
I don't care what it takes, Brian, I've got to get Lois back somehow.
Well, the only one who can help us is Death, and he only shows up when somebody dies.
With President Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer these days.
And with zero tolerance gun control and a strong, well-funded educational system, there's no street crime.
Face it, Peter, you not marrying Lois was the best thing that ever happened to the world.
I don't care! We've got to find a way to summon Death and quick.
Listen, you've got to send me back in time again so I can marry Lois.
Dick Cheney, the chairman of Halliburton, shot Supreme Court Justice Scalia in a hunting accident, and the bullet went right through him and killed Karl Rove and Tucker Carlson.
This is the exact moment in 1984 that I sent you to the first time.
You've just got to manage not to screw it up again.
Lois! Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!
Hey, Peter, you all set to go see Zapped! tonight?
That we could both fantasize about him and no one would be gay, yeah, I know the joke.
Hey, Peter, you all set to go see Zapped! tonight?
Scott Baio, gay, blah, blah, blah, blah. Ha, ha, ha...
Say, I was just getting ready to hit the town.
Peter, what the hell are you doing? You're supposed to be with Lois.
Oh, damn it, Brian, what the hell am I gonna do now?
I haven't screw up this bad since I bought Joe Piscopo that barbell set.
All right Joe, now don't get carried away with this.
Don't worry, Peter. I'll only work out during my downtime.
If you don't want to spend time with me, Peter, that's fine.
But at least don't make me wait up all night for you.
I wanted to surprise you with the invitation last night, but you never showed up.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready.
Peter, the Country Club Dance is where Lois said she fell in love with Quagmire.
Suddenly he just doesn't seem very interested in me anymore.
And not Quagmire or any man, she-male, robot or sentient robot curious about its own existence is going to keep you from me!
You had your chance with me and you blew it.
Why, I didn't know I meant that much to you.
I came back thinking I was missing something in my life.
But what I almost missed was the best thing that's ever happened to me.
Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down
You know that mediocre, generic sound you've been looking for?
And I'm touched that you went through so much trouble just to be with me.
Obviously, I made the right choice when I married you.
And, hey, let's just all be grateful that things are completely back to normal again.
(commentator #2) Look at that rack. There's a downhill lie.
How many golf balls can she fit in her mouth?
(commentator #1) You'd pork her for a week, then tire of her.
We could tell stories. Dad, tell the story about when I was born.
We got halfway home with the afterbirth, then had to go back and swap it for Meg. The end.
I got a better one. This is a story of love and loss, fathers and sons, and the foresight to retain international merchandising rights.
And not the Let's experiment kind of boarded from the rear.
(R2-D2) Beep, oop. Uh, could you hold onto this bag?
I guess we'd all just get up and go to that door.
Why are you always way nicer to me when the other rebels aren't around?
OK. There's a little hourglass and it's not letting me do anything.
All I'm trying to do is tell you to wait.
All right. It's telling me I have to download RealPlayer 7.
You know what? I'll just bring it to him myself.
You still got that bag I gave you? It's gonna be a long ride.
Hold your fire. There's no life forms aboard. Hold your fire?! Are we paying by the laser now?
I'm gonna do crosswords but that doesn't mean I don't wanna talk.
(Darth Vader) My God, look at this mess! Darth Vader's gonna be here. Shall we clean up? No, it's OK, he won't mind.
Prepared to tell me what you've done with the stolen Death Star plans?
I've hidden the plans in one of these 26 briefcases.
Ooh, ooh! OK, OK. I'm feeling number 14. Let's go with number 14.
(groans) It's OK, I'm just happy to be on TV.
Jabba the Hutt right after a shower, or a service droid?
You can kiss the lower part of the back of the canister that is my body.
Oh, boy. It's OK, R2 - calm down, be cool.
What, a droid can't walk down the desert no more?
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they obtained.
This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.
That is fantastic. Terrific work. So no weaknesses at all, huh?
Uh, OK. Wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask: What's the.01?
Well, I mean, there's this little hole - it was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect - and if you shoot a laser into this hole, the station blows up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! That sounds like a pretty big design flaw.
Exactly. And to get within range of it, you have to skim along a trench. It's no big deal.
Can't we board it up or put some plywood over it or something?
That would look terrible - we gotta think about resale.
What? This property is right above Sunset - the value's only gonna go up.
Lord Vader, your inside references to the Los Angeles real estate market haven't given you the clairvoyance to turn a profit on that condo in Glendale. Nor...
Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.
If I pass out, note I'm wearing a LifeCall bracelet with all my insurance information.
Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you that your father is Darth Vader.
Aunt Beru, when are you guys gonna let me join the rebellion like all my friends?
Oh, stop whining, Luke, and come have some blue milk.
One day, I'm just gonna take off and join the rebellion, whether you like it or not.
Some day, I'll get off this rock and fight the Empire.
I am overstocked on intergalactic, proton-powered, advertising droids, and I am passing the savings on to you!
Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye some womp rats in my T-16.
There's two suns and no women - what the hell am I supposed to do?!
R2. He took off in the middle of the night.
(Limbaugh) My good friends, the liberal galactic media is at it again. They never stop.
Now they're trying to convince us Hoth is melting. It's just trying to scare us.
And if that weren't enough to get you mad, we now have news that Lando Calrissian has been made the chief administrator of the Bespin Mining Facility.
Gee, I wonder how he got that job. Let me tell you how:
That's not what I said. I said, There ain't a pack of menthols on this planet.
Well, I see some bantha tracks, but I don't see any...
Wait a minute, they're Sand People, all right. I can see one of 'em now.
So, Luke, what brings your muscly arms out this way?
I'll show you, Mr Obi-Wan. R2, play him the message.
General Kenobi, many years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars.
And, not to get too personal, but you owe us after that mess you got into back on Alderaan.
And we paid to keep the families of those children quiet, so...
This is just, like, logistical stuff. I'll check that later. ... Joey Lawrence haircut. So I'll assume we can count on your help to get the Death Star plans to my father on Alderaan.
Luke, you must learn the ways of the Force and come with me to Alderaan.
Hey, why would you hang that up? It looks so tantalising.
You know, the Empire's gonna come looking for these droids.
But if they find out who the Jawas sold them to, that could lead them back... home!
Great. Now we gotta do the rest of this thing with Danny Elfman.
You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
How are we gonna get in here? We don't have any chicks with us.
It's way easier to get into these clubs if you have chicks in your group. Noticed that?
You saw me here last week. I seemed like a cool dude.
I saw you here last week. You seemed like a cool dude.
I'm Pignose, and this is my brother-in-law, Scott. He's visiting from Hoth.
I don't know why they call it Hoth. They should call it Coldth.
Thank you. We're the Cantina Band. If you have any requests, shout 'em out.
This door is locked. Move on to the next one.
Whoever's in there won't be getting this giant cheque from Publisher's Clearing House.
I heard voices, but they stopped, so I'm gonna assume there's no one in there.
Hi. My sexy friend and I are looking for a ship to take us to Alderaan, and I'm willing to pay big money.
Well, you've come to the right place. I'm Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon, and the only actor whose career isn't destroyed by this movie.
It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs.
Oh... Isn't a parsec a unit of distance, not time?
No, no, no. Chewie, take these guys to the ship and get her ready.
Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was just going to see Jabba and tell him...
Thank you. This was my brother's. He died of leukaemia. How do you feel now?
I'll show you around, since no one's trying to stop the ship or blast us.
Now I can't show you around. Quick, get in the ship.
Look at that one on the left. Get off your cellphone, you are driving.
Uh, that... that was your manoeuvre - moving slightly to the left?
Well, we're not in the same place we were. Huh? That ought to confuse 'em.
Yeah, but you hardly did anything. You just started listing lazily to the left.
Governor Tarkin. I recognised your foul stench as soon as I was brought on board.
I got pages of these - I could go on.
Princess Leia, we've chosen to test our Death Star, planet-blower-upper gun on your home planet of Alderaan.
So anyway, I says, Forget the dental plan, forget sick leave, I just want a railing.
Good evening, Death Star. Tonight, a special report on a controversial attack on Alderaan.
While some view the attack as unwarranted, the Empire has obtained proof that Alderaan was in possession of weapons of mass destruction.
Now let's go to our forecast. What's the weather like, Ali?
Coming up, the road closures for this week's Ewok Pride parade. Stay with us.
Imagine you're spreading butter on a big piece of bread.
You mean that thing you just found out about and are now judging me for not believing in?
Honestly, I have no idea. I'm just a slave to trends.
What the hell? Oh, my God! We came out of hyperspace into an asteroid field.
Maybe we should head for that small moon that's clearly a small moon, not anything else.
No, just kidding. Can you imagine if I was like that?
(Han) All right, just follow my lead and act real cool.
All right, I'm gonna go knock out that tractor beam.
You know, Luke, this may be the last time we see each other, so there's something I want you to know.
Now you've said something better, so my thing don't sound cool.
(Han) No, no. Here's the Banana Republic, and we just passed that. It's right back there.
Now, we parked on the Macy's side, so now we must be over here by JC Penney.
(Luke) The first floor is mostly men's stuff, and there's a Lady Foot Locker there.
(Han) Let's get in the elevator. And hurry up, cos the smell of that Mrs. Fields is killing me.
And do you, Alan, take Judith to be your lawfully wedded wife, till death or a giant explosion do you part?
You think you could get me a room by the pool?
Is funny because you are prisoner. And there is no pool because is Death Star.
(Han) We gotta find out what cell the princess is in.
We had a weapons malfunction, but everything's perfectly all right. We're fine. We're all fine... here... now.
Well, I'm in this relationship and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
Why don't you try seeing each other more often and see if you connect more?
If not, it may be time to move on. Thanks for calling.
This is Han Solo. I'll be keeping you company for the next few hours on the midnight shift.
Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan are here to rescue you.
Great idea, Princess - diving into a pile of garbage.
When we get out of here maybe you can show me around your home planet of Alderaan. Aw!
Listen to them, R2. They're dying. What do we do?
Man, I wish I could listen to some Tatooine Wind and Fire right now.
I think... I think... I think I may be having sort of a mini freakout here.
Just... just tell me I don't have to stay in this room.
Just tell me I don't have to stay in this room.
And look at this couch! Somebody threw out a whole couch, and it's in great shape.
You put Febreze on that, scrub it out a bit, it'll look great in your apartment.
You know what? I know we have a dangerous job to do here, but I'm taking this. I'm taking this couch.
See the way I'm twisting it? Turn it that way from your end.
All right, let's... just hang on and figure this out.
There are stormtroopers all over the place. Shouldn't we be getting outta here?
All right, OK. OK, I got it. I know what we...
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler. It's easier than we're making it.
You know that last drill we had? I was about to finally bone my girlfriend, then we heard that there was this drill and she told me there was no way.
What part of Stay 50 yards away at all times don't you understand?
All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Counterclockwise from where I'm standing, so... so then... so clockwise.
Put it down for a sec. My fingers are killing me.
It's not going anywhere. Let's just take off. We'll deal with it later.
You get in the cockpit, and I'll just hang onto this thing as we go.
I mean, sometimes the brain is still active for a few minutes after the beheading, but to be honest, I can't imagine a worse kind of hell.
And unfortunately, hell is probably where he'll end up, because the Christians don't look too kindly on the whole Force thing.
Come on, kid. We're not out of the woods yet.
A nickel for every time I've had that problem. Just keep shooting, Luke.
Yeah! That's how we do it in my neighbourhood, bitch!
I just want to tell you both: Good luck, we're all counting on you.
OK, but... OK, but I gotta go. I got other stuff to do.
The homing beacon is safely on board the Millennium Falcon.
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader. It had better work.
I'd killed Obi-Wan, then I look over and there are two dudes scurrying across with a couch.
It had the stain on it from when we had Hawaiian punch night.
Thanks to the information in this R2 unit provided by Princess Leia, we should be able to mount a successful offensive on the Death Star.
But first, please take a moment to watch this instructional video.
Hi, I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips on blowing up the Death Star.
There are gonna be so many folks coming at you to slow you down, you might feel like you got a bull's-eye on your head.
Also, don't forget you have teammates out there watching your back - unless you been messing around with their wife or girlfriend!
Lastly, you wanna make sure you step back and take cover after you sink that bucket, cos that sky gonna light up like the Fourth of July.
Hey, Luke. I was under a Y-wing, working on the space engine, and the whole thing just dropped on me.
So I'll just be here making sandwiches for when you guys get back.
Oh, no. I mean, I couldn't. Whatever you make will be fine.
I mean, you're doing stuff and... and I think that's great.
So you got your reward and you're leaving, is that it?
When you say it that way, I sound like a douche, but yeah.
Let's see, I got 10% off a Netflix membership, um... some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar, assorted lotions, and a little plastic champagne bottle full ofjellybeans, and a little bear.
(silly voice) Hey, Luke, we had fun on the Death Star.
Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at.
Careful, Redd Foxx - there's one right on your tail!
Force that thing in there, just like I showed you with those puppets.
It's important for the kids to witness the plight of the rebellion.
Fuck you, you son of a bitch! What am I, R-Tupac?
And with today's gas prices, not a minute too soon!
Look at how much more comfortable we are now, shooting stuff.
(Obi-Wan Kenobi) Luke, the Force will be with you always.
Of course, when you get older and get some crow's-feet,
Well, Dad, thanks for keeping us entertained. That was a great story.
Yeah. But didn't Robot Chicken already do this three months ago?
Don't worry about it. I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.
It's the highest-rated show on Cartoon Network, and the Star Wars episode doubled that audience.
Don't be glib about this stuff. It's a legitimate show, and they beat you to the punch.
I don't know about that, Chris. To me, a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC.
What is that? 15 minutes of guys playing with Star Wars dolls? Oh, yay...
I read part of a review online. I am not a fan.
You know, Doctor, you said you were going to cure my cancer, but all you did was rape me!
I'm starting to think I don't have cancer at all.
Well, you're right, about the rape part, but I'm sorry, you still do have cancer.
Brian, did you know that Daryl Hannah has one wooden finger?
Jillian, can you, uh, run and get me a beer from the kitchen?
Well, Peter, if you want, you can have my ticket.
Stitch is going to do a skating duet with Sebastian the Crab.
So, Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone... these would all be things to avoid.
Um, Peter, you want to go see Disney On Ice?
I'll be right back. I'm going to go put on my Donald Duck costume.
Meg, lend me 25 cents so I can ride the toy airplane outside and make the immigrant kids jealous.
I'm having a magical aerial adventure because my family has disposable income.
How come you're always here by yourself? Are you like a bitch or something?
I need disposable diapers, but it looks like you're out.
Oh, no, I got some in the stockroom. Hang on.
Here's my summary of every Vince Vaughn movie: Oh, I'm incapable of loving another person. Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end.
Oh, my God! Now I've got to clean up this up!
I don't have any money so I'm going to have to pay for these comic books with my poo.
Chris, how come you don't have any money? I thought you had a paper route.
Well, I'm taking a sabbatical to focus on my pottery.
Well, maybe I can talk to Carl and get you a job here.
You and I will be the best brother-sister team since Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal.
Plus, it's given me a chance to work on my novel.
Oh, what is it? Faster Than the Speed of Love.
No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father, who's a pilot, that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country.
Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta gather all these old World War II pilots to help him rescue his father.
Well, well, in mine, one of the World War II guys is Japanese, but they accept him anyway.
Boy, it sure is fun hanging out with you, Peter.
That means thank you in my new language I'm inventing.
Anyway, all I was saying is, if you think about it, it shouldn't have been Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
'cause that was all the stuff he wanted to do.
Yeah. And he was so on that day, so it kind of works on two levels.
Well, I don't know what you mean by that, but how about that Cameron, huh?
That is just what I was going to... His day off... that is just what I was going to say. You know, you are a catch, young lady.
I don't know when the hell Brian is going to open his eyes and get serious with you.
It'd be so great if we were at least living together.
Well, you need to just lay it on the line with him.
Because of what you said, Jillian wants us to move in together!
Well, I think you should, Brian. She's beautiful, she's funny, and she is smart as the day is wide.
Don't you understand?! I don't want a committed relationship with Jillian.
And if you're never going to get serious, then you're not being fair to her.
I will ask her to move in with me. and you'll see, I've got what it takes.
Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian, this move is really working out great.
Oh, I was just on my way back from the cobbler.
I'd come here, and then it's off to the haberdasher.
And that's the worst part. I can't afford the rent.
I'll be lucky if I can make it to the end of the month.
Yeah, yeah, I filled out most of the paperwork, too.
Chris, I need you to stack the boxes in the back for me.
Uh, you know what, Meg? Why don't you do that?
Oh, that's 'cause there's a bunch of stuff in them.
I mean, she's really hot in it, but it's also a good movie.
She was in A Beautiful Mind, and I've gotta say, the direction was excellent but I was very disappointed that she, um... wore clothes the entire film.
Yeah, in the way that, like, classy women with expensive clothing who never take the moff are hot, you know?
All right. So, like, you see a hotgirl, and you're like, okay, I appreciate your exterior beauty
'cause you definitely worked at it with the clothing, and the jewelry, and the makeup and stuff, but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man... where is the chase and how do I cut to it?
Listen, I hope you don't mind Stewie staying with us for a little while.
He, uh, he just gets really lonely without me at home.
They're right in front of you! Which cabinet are you looking at?!
There aren't any, Brian! You need to come in here!
What the hell is this?! I am not cleaning this up.
Shut up, Chris! You can't tell me what to do.
Well, go see that movie and absorb its message, and you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about.
Hey, by the way, you know who else is hot in kind of a screwed up way?
Yeah, yeah, in that sort of you think you could get her, cause she could be your brother kind of thing.
You know, she was in Leaving Las Vegas in addition to Adventures in Babysitting.
One of those underrated actresses that was always talented and beautiful, and never quite popped, if you know the meaning.
He's a failed writer who just decides that, Ooh, I'm going to have a big last hurrah in Las Vegas.
And then he meets a whore and pays her a bunch of money to stay with him, uh, and have sex with him while he murders himself slowly.
And, you know, she's game for it, but she catches feelings midway through and the whole thing changes.
Don't talk, please. Hang on, let me get a condom.
Stewie, what the hell are you doing? Go back to bed.
Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me, I'll stop paying the rent.
That's right, I'm paying Mr. Lickity-self's half of the rent.
Because you wanted me to move in so badly, and God knows, I didn't want to...
Well, I don't want to be your guilty burden, Brian!
Look, Brian, I know you're upset now, but I think it's important to see things in perspective.
And then he got another one, and everything was all right?
I'm free now. I've got my own place, no attachments.
There you are. That's just the kind of can-do spirit that built this nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
I'm sorry you overpaid for your house, but it's not going in.
The only job I could find was for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.
All right, I am totally flaccid, but thank you anyway, m'am,
I just got my paycheck and my salary's doubled ever since Meg got fired.
Gee, I didn't realize working at the store meant that much to her.
You know, it would mean the world to her if she could get her job back.
And you'd be one terrific brother if you could help her.
She got a worse deal than that no-armed baseball player, Bucky LaGrange.
Ground ball to shortstop. The throw is to second, and again, the ball sails past LaGrange into right field.
The runners will score and a cascade of boos rain down from the stands as clearly the fans' sympathy for this scrappy, little no-armed man has run out.
Now, granted the throw was a little wide, but you've got to believe that a two-armed player would've made the catch.
In fact a one-armed player would have at least had a shot at it, which calls to mind the question once again, why, with all the two-armed youngsters waiting in the minor leagues, does this team stick with an arm-less second baseman?
What the hell?! What are you people doing in my apartment?
Come on, time for you to meet some women who are going to make you forget about Jillian.
Look out for this one, she's a bit of a card.
No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass. I-I don't want her back in here.
Well, if you hire Meg back, maybe I'll have an opinion.
Look, Stewie, get these stupid '80s movie robots out of here, and leave me alone.
You let the fat man talk you into moving out.
Jillian, look, I made a huge mistake. I don't want to lose you.
I don't know how to tell you this, but you're too late.
If I miss my Moesha, I get a bit crabby.
I really appreciate what you did for me, but I can't work for that guy anymore.
The important thing is that you stood up for me.
Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian, but it is good to have you back.
I mean, you are never going to find a chick that hot again.
Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe you got another chapter for your book.
Family Guy Believe It Or Not, Joe's Walking On Air www.forom.com
Hey, check it out, you guys, I got a new cell phone that takes pictures.
Oh, we just decided to have a little girls' night out.
Yeah, you guys talk about this place all the time, we figured we'd give it a try.
Bernice, we haven't really been dating long enough for you to be hanging out with my friends' wives.
The Clam's the only place we got to get away from the women.
This is a bigger disaster than Jack Black's last movie.
Wait a minute. Butlers are supposed to be fancy and well-mannered.
You're an old man! You don't understand the young people.
You know, boys, we just might make this at regular thought.
Yeah, sorry Joe, I just had one of my Scrubs fantasy moments.
I hate shows that cut away from the story for some bullcrap.
Fellas, our way of life is being threatened and we got to do something about it.
I got something way more expensive and time-consuming in mind.
It took six weeks and cost $8,000, but it was worth it.
Peter, I wish you'd get rid of this thing. It's an absolute eye sore.
What do you care, Lois? You girls got the Clam, we got the Quahog Men's Club.
You ripped a whole chunk of wall out of the house!
Peter, you can't just slap together flimsy structures in the yard.
All right, Peter, this is a tough one. All right you ready for this? Okay, would you have sex with Cleveland. if it meant you could have sex with Angelina Jolie.
Missionary, and you have to look him in the eyes, no closing your eyes and pretending it's somebody else.
All right, here's another one. Who would you rather have sex with?
A very pregnant Gina Gershon or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?
You know, I know this is a men's club but why does it always have to be about sex?
Janet Reno after a safari, or the fat guy from My Name is Earl?
Well, then, what the hell does safari have to do with it?
Does he have an idea, or do I have to come up with it myself?
I'd have to give it to Janet Reno, 'cause I've always had this business plan for a home delivery of prescription medications, and that seems like it's more her market.
Well, I'd say the men's club inaugural ball is a huge success.
Let's go stand over near Brian, and we'll take a drink every time he says bonerific.
Are you feeling terrific, or any variation on that word?
No. Why would I say that? It's not even a word.
Yeah. You know, Barn, I figure I ought to tell you this.
I was walking by your house the other day, and, uh, I poked my head in the window and Betty was undressing.
She didn't stop. I mean, she saw me there, looking at her and she kept undressing.
No, it just... seems like sort of a '70s medication.
Yeah, I guess, you know, whatever, it's 96 degrees out.
You got a lot going on under there, huh, under... under the wool cap?
Yeah. No, no, no, no, you're not a complete jackass.
Oh, you got a little tear in your pants, there...
Society wants your pants to be intact, but you're just not gonna listen, are you?
My God, this is ridiculous. I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to kill you.
All right, one more pre-party drink, and then we'll head off to the Clam.
Boy, they sure are making a lot of noise out there.
Those idiots have done nothing but hang out in that stupid shed for the last two days.
We should march in there and remind them that they have wives.
Especially if they have food, because bar food is so overpriced.
Quagmire, tell that story about the girl with the inside-out anus.
All right, so I'm skulking around the intensive care unit, and all of sudden this smoking hot chick...
Oh, come on, Peter. It'd be good to have some chicks in here.
That's the problem. The ratio be terrible. It's a total mast-fest in here.
Well, we can fix that. Come on, girls, let's dance!
Hey, hey, hey, stop it! You women can't dance in here!
Well, I know two people who'll take my side on this.
Oh, it's okay, Joe. I don't mind sitting here with you.
What I mean is... I don't want to hold you back.
Don't be silly, honey. It's just as nice watching other people have fun.
Sometimes I feel more useless than the head of the Maid's Union.
I mean, I knew what to expect after, you know, Joe's accident, and I'm prepared to live the rest of my life this way.
If only there was some way for me to walk again.
There's nothing wrong with me. I'm no different than any other guy!
Joe, would you put on your hand-shoes and take out the garbage?
It sure would be wonderful if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.
I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese, but I'm not sure if any cosmetic surgery is even possible.
It's not an issue of money, your head is a cheeseburger.
There's no blood flow to it. It's just, it's just dead cow meat.
All right, well, I appreciate you giving it to me straight.
I want to walk again. I'll do what ever it takes.
If you'd be willing to sign a waiver, I think I may be able to help you.
You know, when you talk, you sound, a lot like my father-in-law,
Yeah, you know, we've never really had any extended interactions, so I've never noticed it.
Now, Mr. Swanson, through the magic of digital imaging, we'll select the legs most suited to your body from our inventory of donors.
Ah, good choice. These are the only ones we have in stock that aren't hilarious.
Ah, Joe. You are gonna be happier than bullfrogs on vacation in Ethiopia.
Ah, this is fantastic! This is even better than they said it was in the brochure!
Oh, I feel like a pig, but, come on, we're on vacation!
Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson, and let the anesthetic do its job.
Hi, I'm Jamie Farr, and you're about to perform leg surgery.
He's been in there an awful long time. I hope everything's all right.
I put his old legs in a bag if you want them.
Oh, great. We'll take them home, we'll give them to Brian.
I've got working legs for the first time in 15 years, and I'm gonna use them.
I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson. Hospital rules, you have to leave in a wheelchair
My God, we haven't done it in so long, I had forgotten how big you were.
Listen, these new legs have given me my life back.
I want to do all the things I could never do when I was handicapped.
And you guys are my best friends. I want you to experience it all with me.
Come on, ladies! Kick your high heels off and get moving!
When the band began to play The stars were shining bright
But now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say good night
Nothing could be grander than to be in Louisiana In the mornin', in the morn...
Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted since I had that job as Jackee Harry's personal grocery shopper.
Am I reading this right? You need a pallet of chocolate-covered pretzels?
Where the hell am I supposed to...? And what is this, a drum of grape jam?
What is that? Is that like a drum like they ship oil in?
And look at this one : A desk of Cheez-Its.
A desk? Where are you getting these units of measurement from?
Okay, you stay right here, big funny gal. I'll be right back with... a hammock of cake.
Oh, Joe, I don't know. I'm still chafed from that power walk.
Both of my inner thighs look like those big cherry Swedish Fish.
I'm taking my new friends. This is Parker, Quentin and Portland.
Well, Peter, I realized over the last few days, the only reason I hung out with you guys is that I was crippled and you were lazy.
I decided it's time I got some friends more suited to my status.
I can believe it. Joe just dumped us. He's gone.
And all we got to remember him by are his old legs.
Peter, I wish you'd go over there and patch things up with Joe.
He doesn't need us anymore now that he's got his cool, new friends.
I tell you, those legs have turned him into a complete jerk.
It's like giving a monkey the keys to an amusement park.
How is it anything like a monkey having the keys to an amusement park?
The prizes for games of chance would all be bananas.
I'm... Just go with it. Support me in these moments.
Well, Peter, there have been a lot of changes in Joe's life, and maybe he just needed to move on.
If I were you, I'd look for a new friend. A kindred spirit, like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.
I was thinking about how I wanted to find the son of God and nail him to some wood.
Think I'll go for a walk outside now The summer sun's calling my name...
So, do you really think you're suited to be the fourth guy in our group, Buzz Killington?
Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here in the booth and crack jokes, but you're kind of a buzz kill.
Oh, on the contrary. I've quite a mastery of the humorous yarn.
Do any of you know the tale of how corn meal came to be
Neither did the miller when he left his house that morning.
There's nothing to talk about. I've out grown you, Bonnie.
And then the bastard completely blew me off to hang out with those new douche bags.
It's the right thing to do, like taking out Hitler.
Boy, we, uh, really did a number on each other.
You know, I just want to take this opportunity to apologize to you guys.
Oh, it's just good to have our old Joe back.
And once our injuries heal up, we can all go for a nice, long walk.
I know it's a little self-centered, but this is my favorite day of the year.
I didn't know who I was until I heard this album.
You have been hurt by somebody, that much is clear.
Are you trying to make us look bad, you son of a bitch?
Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian meant for me to go with him, did you?
Great. This was a bigger waste of time than Ringo's song-writing.
Yeah, be good till we get back, and Brian, stay out of the cat box!
Oh, I haven't been this disappointed since I saw The Lake House.
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bar you from the aft section of the ship for the rest of the cruise.
Peter, what the hell did you think you were doing?
Uh, I feel like that fat-ass British girl from Titanic.
I'll teach that hussy to go on a boat ride without me.
When she returns, I'm going to put bamboo splinters under all her fingernails.
Then I'm gonna strip her down and tie her to the bed.
Then I'm gonna make her crawl on her hands and knees while I drip hot candle wax all over her back.
Are you gonna shower her off after all that candle wax?
And then I'm gonna gag her with her own brassiere.
No, I mean, that-that would like, that, that would show her.
You're getting some kind of sick sexual thrill off this, aren't you?
You're gonna bitch and moan, and then you're gonna do what you always do : the minute Lois walks through that door, you're gonna forget all about it, beg for your apple juice, go poop and fall asleep.
I'll do to her what douche bags did to the guitar.
Peter, stop picking your teeth. We're at the Captain's table.
And that was the first time I saw the Northern Lights at their peak.
I turned to my first mate and I said, We are looking into the very eyes of God.
So me and Lois are driving up to Vermont to get this abortion...
All right, so we're driving up to get this abortion and we get to the abortion clinic and the abortionist has one hand.
So I turn to Lois and I says, You want to get an abortion here? You want to get an abortion with the abortionist having a stump hand? We can't get an abortion here.
So, we turned around and went home and two-and-a-half months later our daughter Meg was born.
Well, send me the crap to hell for being nostalgic about the early years of our marriage.
I am mortified to even show my face around this ship!
Hey, the captain's the one who should be embarrassed. His story was gay.
With all the indignities I've been forced to suffer day in and day out under your matriarchal tyranny.
What are you... wh... what are you doing with a gun?
And finally, still no word on the disappearance of Lois Griffin, housewife and mother from Quahog who vanished from a cruise ship six days ago.
Hi, Peter. Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
What is it, Joe? Please tell me Lois is alive.
It's been six days, Peter. I'm sorry, but we had to call off the search.
I'm afraid you're just going to have to accept the fact that.. she's gone.
We now return to... Harrison Ford Telling Random People He Wants His Family Back.
You know, I'm glad you're finally putting yourself out there.
Well, I can't do sex. But I can give you a stick job.
But the freakiest was that date I had with Bonnie.
I don't know, Bonnie, it's, it's just a little weird.
Just remember, whatever you do, don't tell Chris I'm dating.
Did we get any mail from Mom at the health spa today?
She said she's going straight from the spa right back to Europe.
But I haven't seen Mom since she took me back-to-school shopping.
All right, sweetie, you ready to get some new notebooks and protractors and slacks?
Finish your oatmeal, and then I'll get you ready for our Mommy and Me class.
You know, Meg has really flourished since Lois was murdered.
Which is just what someone who pulled off the perfect murder would want you to think.
Could you reachin to my pocket and get the number for that acupuncturist?
Well, I'm going to expose you for what you are.
No matter what it takes, you are going to pay for this.
You know, it's funny, from this position, I can hear Meg upstairs.
Hey, put your wallets away, guys. The drinks are on me.
I didn't know that you had life insurance on Lois.
Right after we had that big fight when I said, I wish you were dead, right before I never saw her again.
Well, see you guys later. I got to go buy hot dogs.
Either of you guys think it's a little suspicious that Peter took out a life insurance policy on Lois right before she went missing?
That son of a bitch! He's a killer, like Bernie Goetz!
I used to do a bit about him back when I was doing standup.
This guy Bernie Goetz shot a bunch of muggers on the subway.
Wouldn't mind having him with me next time I go see my mother-in-law.
No, but really, New York City's a great place to live... if you're a cockroach.
Hey, Stewie, I found this receipt for a speedboat rental upstairs in your room.
Um, someone who rented a speedboat must have left it there.
I am going to find the evidence to put you away.
Starting by proving that you were on that cruise ship the night Lois disappeared.
No, I wasn't. I was at the carnival with Rupert.
Oh, okay. You want to go ride the tea bags... tea cups?
I was hoping to keep these mementos, Rupert, but I can't risk it with the dog sniffing around for evidence.
Well, the trail is pretty cold by now, but if Peter did kill Lois, we might find some clues in his garbage.
Man, I haven't dug through these cans since Lois died.
Can't believe it's been 12 months since I've deliberately choked myself by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges down my throat.
Just around the corner there's a rainbow in the sky
You're a suspect in Lois' murder, that's what's going on!
Don't make us go good cop, developmentally disabled cop on you.
We can, um, put you at the, um, scene where she, um, was, um, killed.
Well, what do you want to do about the breasts?
Ah, take a couple out of the bin we can't find matches for.
Hey, Dad, if they put you in jail, can we go in your room?
Look, don't you kids buy any of this for a second. Your father is innocent.
Describe to me what you're doing to yourself right now. Stop.
Yes, and as a favor to the court, I've produced this simulation of how the killing transpired.
I play Peter, and I hired an Asian hooker to play my daughter.
Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid, and I fart at times that ruin my father-in-law's social occasions, and that's why I'm never invited to them.
Chris, have you ever seen your father do anything bad?
Only in front of the kids to assert my status as dominant male of the pride
If I had a gun on a boat, I'd shoot you.
We find Peter Griffin guilty of murder in the first degree.
Okay, can I ask everyone to please stop saying, Oh, no in this courtroom?
I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment with no possibility of...
Lois, my God, what happened? We thought you were dead!
We now go live to Olie Williams recaping the events of the last episode of Family Guy.
I mean, not tonight 'cause I've got plans with the guys, but tomorrow night, I want to hear all about it.
He shot me point-blank right on the deck of the cruise ship.
I would have been dead if it hadn't been for a passing merman... who treated my wounds and carried me to safety.
It sounds romantic, I know,  but unfortunately, he was kind of a reverse of what you'd expect a merman to be.
What are you talking about? I thought this was a woman's fantasy.
Like if you had a man's body and fish legs, then it'd be different.
Unfortunately, I was suffering from total amnesia and had no idea who I was.
After wandering around for a while, I discovered I was in North Carolina where I managed to get a job at a summer camp for fat kids.
It was my job to keep the children from eating each other.
Over the next several months, I developed a relationship with a seemingly nice young townie named Derek.
Eventually, he got comfortable enough with me  to introduce me to his friends.
That's how I found out he was a white supremacist.
Okay, first order of business, uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy, who have agreed to bring cookies for next week's punch social.
You know, it's remarks like that that started the Holocaust.
And I know none of us want that to happen again.
And after that blow to the head, it all started coming back to me.
So I rushed back to Quahog, and here I am.
So what you're saying is we've got a homicidal baby on our hands.
Sorry to bother you, but we have a fugitive baby on our hands.
No, I haven't,officer, but I sure will keep my eyes open.
Okay, well, uh, can you just give him this flyer?
Just take this flyer and if you see this baby...
Boy, I sure hopethey find him. Otherwise, we're all gonna be...
Stewie, uh, how long you been all messed up and evil like this?
Last week when I made that macaroni picture of an owl, you didn't give a damn!
Yes, and now we're going to look at it again.
That's not very nice, Brian. Neither is your mother's ass.
Well, I got to tell you, Brian, I'm relieved to hear you say that.
Please call me if you see any sign of Stewie.
Wait a minute.You could have drugged this. Well, I'm no fool. Brian, taste this.
Uh, I don't know.He kind of asked me. I think we should do what he says.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?!
I don't understand why I need to give you a credit card imprint.
I didn't see you ask the guy in front of me.
One by my house got a Mack-Donald's right in the store.
Black man gone missing? My God, the media will be all over that.
All right, if I see any cops following me, the dog gets it.
Well, thank you, Brian. That's gonna get me through the rest of this yard work. No, just kidding.You suck.
You forget I'm the one holding the gun, Brian, and you're gonna do exactly as I say.
I'll be as big as I should have been when I was on American Idol.
Stewie, you shouldn't actually even be alive, you sniveling little creep.
I hate you so much I want to shoot you in your face.
Honey, I like you, but you're just not right for this competition.
Yo, dawg, I got to tell you for me, man, that was not even half good, dude.
I don't even care! They don't know what they's talkin' 'bout!
Next time they hear 'bout me, they, they's gonna be, like, We was wrong about Stewie, cause I's gonna be huge.
I's gonna be bigger than every one of all y'alls.
Hey, hey, you know what we should do, guys, while we're here tied up like this?
We should come up with a totally bogus rumor about a celebrity.
And then when we get outta here, we'll spread it around as much as we can.
Actually, that does sound like fun. What'd you have in mind?
Somebody told me he goes down to Home Depot and pays the migrant workers to go to his house and choke him in the shower.
I could buy that. That sounds like something he'd do.
Well, I think that's awful that Rob Schneider does that.
Well, get pissy if you want, Mom. I've enjoyed the time we've had as a family.
No, you shot the gun first. That's why I yelled. That's why I yelled...
There's got to besome clue in here that'll tell us where Stewie might have gone.
I used to have a Willem Dafoe living under my bed.
According tom y schematics, it should be right in here.
This is it, Brian! My plan for world domination is about to come to fruition.
Stewie, for God's sake,th What are you trying to do?!
Once I locate the proper code sequence, this terminal will allow me to take command of the satellites which control the world's power grid.
Once they're under my control, the entire world will be subject to my whims.
Open up in there or we're breaking down the door!
I now control the entire planet's power grid, and unless you want me to send you all back to the Dark Ages, you'll do exactly as I say.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special message from the new president of the world.
I'm not paying you guys to watch TV. Now, get in the damn shower!
I want you to hear my presidential address for Saint Rupert's Day.
Screw off.I don't want anything to do with you or your damn laws.
Um... about the same. Number one mightbe a tiny bit better.
Yeah. They're pretty much... Can I see five one more time?
From this day forward,all the nation's milk must come from Hilary Swank's breasts.
Hey, I don't give a damn what you want! Just get the hell off of my property!
Look, Hilary, all I know is it's breakfast time, I've got this bowl of Corn Flakes, and I gotta beat work at at 9:00 So what are we going to do here?
Not so fast.Did you know you'd have to eat 17 bowls of those Corn Flakes to get the same nutritional value in one bowl of Total?
Also, as I've had quite enough of the fat man, anyone who sees Peter Griffin must throw apples at him.
And, finally, anyone who uses the terms irregardless, a whole 'nother or all of the sudden shall be sent to a work camp.
Peter, I am not going to stand by while other people suffer at the hands of my own baby.
I brought Stewie into this world. It's time for me to take him out!
Dinner's in the oven. All you have to do is turn it to 350 at about 5:15.
I will not stand by while you make innocent people suffer!
I can't do it. You're a terrible,evil child, but you're still my baby,and
Well, that works out perfectly because I can hurt you!
Uh... Peter, he didn't really set you up for that Lethal Weapon line.
Hey, Stewie,we got a postcard from Peter and Lois on the cruise.
Oh, hello, Brian. Well, you recall my complaining about Lois and the fat man not taking me with them?
Well, you said I didn't have it in me to kill Lois, so I was just running a simulation to find out exactly how killing her and taking over the world would play out for me.
I suppose I'm not ready to kill Lois or take over the world... yet.
So, what you're saying is that what you experienced in the simulation didn't really happen or even matter.
Yes, but theoretically, if someone watched the events of that simulation from start to finish, only to find out that none of it really happened,
I mean, you don't think that would be just like a giant middle finger to them?
And I'm Diane Simmons, reporting live from the 35th annual Quahog Veteran's Day celebration.
First up, a float from the Veterans of Future Wars.
Born on the Fifth of July, which he promises will be even July-ier than the original.
Mom, how come, when we see these guys on the street corner, you tell me not to stare a and today that's all we're doing?
Because Chris, as Americans, we owe our lives to these veterans.
I am proud to be an American, and I am going to love my country like never before.
Ooh, on second thought, I got something I got to do back on Krypton.
My God, you look like the Statue of Liberty's pimp.
Boy, I never knew it would feel this good to love my country.
You never really feel them love you back, but that's okay because they got other stuff going on, and you understand.
Peter, you do realize there's a difference between loving America and being swept up dans la parano post 9/11.
Peter, you didn't even know what 9/11 was until 2004.
Lois, I am doing my duty as a patriotic American.
I wanted to play youa song I wrote about what America means to me.
I just had my penis tattooed to look like the space shuttle and my nads tattooed to look like launch exhaust.
Oh, well, maybe I can do something else like-like... like the Space Needle or a banana... or a Sharpie.
Man, that reallymakes me mad-- illegal immigrants coming into this country, taking all the good jobs away from Americans.
Well, I am goingto make sure people like that stay out of Quahog from now on.
We are going to patrol the borders and keep this townas clean as a Jewish porno.
Oh... we are going to have sex at some point.
All right, guys, it's going to be a long night of border patrol, so I brought along Michael McDonald to help us out.
He's going to do backup vocals for everything we say.
How's he gonna know what we're saying? - How's he gonna know what we're saying
Yeah, I hired him for the night. He costs like $250 an hour,
Because he was an illegal immigrant and a threat to our national security.
I guess we'll find out if he ever gets a trial.
What the hell, man?! I don't throw away your stuff.
Because Speedy Gonzales is an immigrant and a bad influence on our children, so I created his Americanequivalent
Hey, Fuad, can I buy you a cup of coffee?
I think Fuad is an illegal immigrant, and I cannot stand by while he steals wages and opportunities from citizens.
You don't see Nike or Microsoft or General Motors or Ford or Boeing or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's profiting from non-American labor.
Maybe we should run a company-wide check to make sure all our personnel are legal citizens.
This country needs more immigrants like my cousin, Peter the pig, needs a new house.
Because I just made stool in there, and if you blow it down, the whole woods is gonna stink.
Hey, uh, there'sa new policy at work where everyone has to prove they're an American, and I need my birth certificate.
I don't know how to tell you this, but you weren't born in America.
When I found out that your real father was a drunken Irishman,
But God had other plans, and you were born right there.
I was so afraid of being judged by the community that I never filled out the paperwork to make you a citizen
Peter, as far as the US government is concerned, you're an illegal Mexican immigrant.
You know, Peter, you can always take a citizenship test.
I mean, if Wilmer Valderrama passed, it can't be that difficult.
Well, by that logic, Lois, it can't be that difficult to nail Lindsay Lohan
All right, you want to head down to the INS?
I'm afraid it doesn't look good for you, Seor Griffin.
So far, you've failed everything, including the Behaving like an American at the airport test.
Yeah, I'm on the way to the next plane now.
Yeah, I got a middle seat, so I'm gonna see if I can switch.
I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza so I got something to stuff in my face while I'm reading USA Today.
The only thing remaining is the oral test, which I will administer here.
Question number two, complete this sentence: The land of the free and the home of the blank.
Mr. Griffin, if you were truly an American, you would know our national anthem.
Of course there's a very easy way of detecting fraud.
Uh, uh, uh, things a festive bow tie would say.
I keep your head dry, you wear me in the bathroom?
I'll just have to find a job for an illegal immigrant.
Hungry eyes. Hotel maid wanted. Ah, sweet, I could do that.
Well, that sounds like a good job for an immigrant.
Now look, don't get upset, but I've been so worried about you that I asked someone for help.
They just takeone DVD a month from the house they're cleaning until they have a respectable collection.
Daddy employs lots of immigrants, and he said you could work at the mansion.
Except for Noriega. God bless him and his drug money.
Oh, look who it is! Come hereso I can give you a hug.
Peter, I'm using you as a house immigrant, so take my family's luggage to their rooms and then go get settled down at the servants quarters.
We're here as a family, and we're gonna live as a family.
We come to a mansion, and you want to live with the help?
Ugh, that's like going to a strip club on a Tuesday afternoon.
Oh, no, that boy's ball fell out of the cup.
Oh, but it's okay because the ball is on a string and attached to the cup.
I'm a diabetic, and I need you to test it.
How the hell do you guys do this every day?
I don't know, Cheech. It seems like a lot of work for no respect.
There are tall buildings, cheeseburgers and Fox's many hit comedy series, including That '70s Show, and, uh...
But let me ask you something: Don't you missyour home?
We come to America for financial opportunities, Peter, but someday we will return to Mexico because our heritage is rich and glorious.
Are you saying there's more to being Mexican than working hard and lusting after big asses?
In fact, we are preparing our Cinco de Mayo celebration.
And later, I'm gonna go lift free weights in a parking lot!
Oh, Peter, I'm so proud that you've embraced these people as your own.
Well, Lois, life can surprise you if you open your mind a little.
For example, I used to hate the Japanese, but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips in Young Guns and now I don't hate them anymore.
Peter, I don't think that Lou Diamond Phillips is Japanese.
Hey, what do you say we get some of them burritos?
I would love to feel your mustache on my mustache.
Well, there's a lot more body hair where that came from.
Look, I don't care what day it is Mexico, in America we work on weekdays.
Now, do your jobs or I'll deport your lazy asses back to the Third World.
What he just said does not represent the America that I know and love.
This country used to welcome our kind with open arms.
But men like Carter Pewterschmidt use us for cheap labor, and then-and then try to punish us when we demand to be treated like human beings.
Immigrants built this country, and I say it's time for us to take it back!
Well, I mean, technically it's yours, but we don't feel like you deserve it, so, we're calling it ours and taking it anyway.
But, Peter, why would you want to harm a fellow American citizen?
All I have to do is make one call to friend of mine in Washington, and he can push your paperwork through.
This great land should be everything to you that it is to me.
A land where a man is paid a wage he can live on.
A land where meals are not purchased from a truck and then eaten in a different truck.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker with a Channel Five News Special Report.
A flash flood warning is in effect as rain continues to pound Rhode Island.
Tom, residents all over Quahog have been affected by the heavy rains, although some are doing their best to ride it out.
Sir, why are you riding your ten-speed in the rain?
I like riding the ten-speed because it's fun, it gives me energy, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
Uh, it's not too demanding, the pay is good, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
I'm living life before the cancer I have kills me so I don't mind the rain.
Water feels good on my skin. It's cool, refreshing, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
It's a quick process, both painful and untreatable, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
Thank you, Tricia. Some local residents have even been evacuated to Quahog Stadium for their own protection.
If you're looking for a bathroom, it's all around you.
Oh, man, I better save my autographed picture of Dean Cain!
You know, from before he got all desperate for attention.
Does it feel like the water suddenly just got warmer?
Peter, the water's rising fast! We got to get out of here!
Hang on, Lois. There's a case of beer in the fridge.
And for God's sake,do not be afraid to make me a sandwich while you're in there.
Boy, you cannot wait to criticize her at every turn, can you?
Well, Lois, I am sorry for snapping at you earlier;
My God, we better get her to a hospital. She doesn't look too good.
Yes, she looks worse than Andy Garcia when he had his conjoined twin.
I had a great time with you tonight. You're really amazing.
So, do you maybe want to go in the other room?
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter.
What... Oh, my God,did you... did you hear what I said?
I never realized until now how much I've taken her for granted.
I mean, she's my only daughter, and I feel like I've never treated her as well as I should've.
You hear me, Meg? If you come out of this,
I am gonna treat you like a princess for the rest of your life.
You want to tell me what the ... that was?
Excuse me, I'm Dr. Milano. I'm the intern for this floor.
We let you know if there's any change in your daughter'scondition.
I want to meet Scrubs, and I want to meet black Scrubs, too.
No more will I treat you like some kind of alien.
You think you can just up and run away, you crazy.
I like to eat people from other planets, especially y'all.
I likes to eat you with my little mouth, too.
Oh, now, y'all get back up inside me, little mouth.
Get back inside-- I'll get you when we's eatin' em.
Well, yes, I-I suppose to the untrained eye that's what it would look like. Walk inside with me, Brian.
This is disgusting--it smells, it's falling apart, and you can hear the mice humping in the wall.
That's why we can get it for a steal, Brian.
We fix it up and sell it for a huge profit!
You're crazy. No, I'm not gonna buy this house with you.
Says it's a smart investment. But what does he know?
Wow, Peter, I got to say, you've really been true to your word about treating Meg better.
She needs to be protected, like a rare gemstone, or the herniated scrotum of an older gentleman.
Yeah, and I can't believe how you stood up to Connie D'Amico for me.
Can I put the rest of them on your giant enormous ass?
I just want youto know, Meg, if there's anythingyou ever want,
Meg, I almost lost you once, I'm not gonnalose you again.
This guy may look harmless on the outside, but on the inside he could be a complete bastard, like Fred Flintstone.
Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell, the cat put me outside,
The elephant's trunkwas on full blast. I couldn't hear you.
But when I want to get my rocksoff, you're nowhere to be found you passive-aggressive bitch.
Meg, can I talk to you in the kitchen, please?
Maybe he's two dwarves in an overcoat wanting to see what sex is like with a big person.
Two crafty dwarves in your house, after your daughter-- wait, do dwarves grant wishes?
Well, good-bye phonein the bathroom, but I still don't like Meg dating that boy.
Guy-guy-guy's that age, all they care about is putting their thing in everything.
I'm not gonna let Meg turn out like my Nerf football in the hall closet.
Dad, didn't you say you'd give me whatever I wanted?
Look, why don't youjust talk to him? You might find outhe's not so bad.
All right, Lois, but I know what my gut tells me.
But I'll suck it up and talk Michael. en though I've also go...
I just think Meg is really cool, and I want to get to know her better.
You know, Michael,my daughter's womb is not a wild firefor you to douse with your adolescent seed.
You ever sit on your arm till it falls asleep, and then play with yourself and pretend like somebody else is doing it?
All right, here's your hammer, here's your walkie, and here's your stud finder.
All right, joke time is over. Work time has begun.
You get started with this dry wall and I'm gonna start pulling out those old floorboards in the kitchen.
Hey, Meg, I, uh, got you something for our three-week anniversary.
Yeah, I remember how you told me you liked terrible music,
Uh, Meg, I'm not sure, but I think dad is sitting at that table over there.
Have you been spying on us the entire time we've been dating?
Meg, it's only because I want to make sure this guy treats you right and doesn't try anything funny.
See, look, Meg, he just walked out on you. He's a bad man.
All right, Brian, I'm going to go up to the upper level and run this wire down through the wall.
Grab your walky I'll call you when I get up there.
Wait, if you haven't started feeding it, why'd you ask me if I could see it?
I said why'd you ask me if I could see it, if you haven't started feeding it? Over.
For the record, I don't want to hang out with you anymore when this is over.
I said I don't want to hang out with you anymore
Wait a minute. I have to say over even if the sentence ends with the word over?
It doesn't keep me up at night, but it helps me poo!
Don't you think it's time to forget about that boy?
Yeah, Meg, he was a bum anyway. You'll find another fellow.
I could set you up with one of my friends.
I didn't know that when I set you up with her.
You're pregnant, Meg, and there's only one thing to do.
Meg, can you turn over? I gotta get that thing out of there.
You're sitting on my shirt; I gotta put it on this hanger.
Now I'm going to Michael's house to force himto marry you.
But this changes everything. I want to be there for you, Meg.
Ah, now see? That's an even more beautiful sight than 72 virgins waiting in heaven for a suicide bomber.
I'm starting to think maybe we bit off a little more than we could chew.
Well, we're in it and we're going to finish the job.
I've, um... I've got an idea. I'll be right back.
So, listen, we're going to want to be leaving now.
Because I just emptied a full tank of gasoline and lit a match.
I guess this means you'll be going to doggie hell.
Meg, are you sure you want to go through with this?
I'm not saying an abortion, per se, maybe you just drink and smoke a lot.
Just don't stop doing it and then chicken out halfway through the pregnancy, because then you'll wind up with Chris.
Oh, and they were all out of the bride and groom figurines, so I got the Iron Giant and a courtroom doll that kids use to show where the molester touched them.
'cause I don't need to see what you crazy girls are going to do while I'm gone.
But just remember, this is a residence and should be treated as such.
And if you girls drink anything, there's recycling under the sink in the kitchen.
What am I going to do? Michael's out there waiting for me.
Well, Meg, the best thing you can do is be honest.
God, look at Meg's fat shoulders in those spaghetti straps!
I have never been more in love with someone than I am with you right now.
I guess sometimes a father just gets a little over protective of his daughter, but you got to know I was only thinking about your happiness.
The problem now is that these people are expecting a show.
Peter, you're just supposed to pick up Cleveland's mail, not go through it.
I wish I could tell you that the Monopoly guy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
Hey, Rupert, what if the refrigerator was a monster that talked like this?
He had a mustache which is praal like wedding ring
I imagine you're going to be much more of a stern father, now that you have a mustache.
And I might answer most of your questions with a story.
But, mostly,my mustache tells people that there is a 90% chance that I am poorly educated, that I keep upscale pornziou the open and that I listen tothe Little River Band with giant headphones.
Ugh! That's the ugliest thing the Fatman's grown since that horse leg.
Aw, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?
There is nothing that'll ever happen in the rest of our lives that's as important as what's going on right here, right now, in high school, by these lockers.
If you plopped me inthe middle of a high school, cobe the mpukid there in a week.
Okay, if I winand you cado yoveput your nose eg's hat andeanht second inhale.
Wow, Dad, you're up early. it's a achekind of morning, C.
I watched the sunrisein my jeans, jean shirt and jean jacket.
I'm gonna make you somehash browns for breakfast, and then, later, I'm gonna takeyou down to the whoreh to lose your virginity.
Wow, that's a waybetter present than that buff hamsteryou got me last Christmas.
Dad, all it's done i n hat whee for the pahree weeks.
Boy, you know, I've alwayswanted to come in here, and now that I got a mustache,the timing feels right.
'cause I'm about to becomethe most popular boy in school.
I weong ve shider short sl shi under se ts
, odyou'icked cool!, you're so cool! ve cmate my teenage cynicism!
Excellent m a bi hit wthe thil and his, clea res wom
What-what, wha-why whhat elp out mom and dadby getti job
Peter, don't younk you'rend of letting that mustache consumur personality?
Well, I haven't seen him since this morning and I..
Peter, I know you're upsetabout losing that thing, get a grip on yourself.
No, I own the restaurant, and to show my gratitude,
I'd like to offer you a lifetimesupply of McBurgertown burgers.
Oh, man, this isa way better offer than the one I gotfrom Helen Hunt.
Come to think of it,I can't really feel anything on the left half of my body.
Your father had a stroke and it may take him along time to recover.
Uh, Lois, you mind telling me what the hellyou think you're doing?
This is my good arm! Bring the beer over here!
You can see them onmy MySpace page, along with my favorite songsand movies and things that other people have created, but that I use toexpress my individualism.
No, but seriously, there's something I wantto talk to you about.
You wanna go out toAnal Point this weekend, see what all thebuzz is about?
Before you know it, we'll belike an old married couple.
Dummy with the rapture and therevered and the right, right
I- or rather, myalter ego, Zac Sawyer- am currently the most popular boy at James Woods High.
Well, Stewie, you got the best of meon this one.
Do you know thatI've got a date with Connie D'Amico this Saturday night,at Anal Point?
Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it like a parking spacethat you think, Gosh, there's no way I'm gonna be ableto fit in there.
But then you fold inthe sideview mirrors and sure enough,well, look at that.
Well, in that scenario, it sounds like I'd rather be the parking spacethan the car.
I swearI'll get back at you someday for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.
If only there were some way I could belike everybody else again.
Five minutes.I went in there they injected me with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam good ol'gambling man Peter.
I'll find a way with the help of my snarky cat lawyer
They have a hundred lawyers, and you tried to bribe me with a subscription to Grape Soda Today which I already have.
One man can't take on a multinational fast food conglomerate.
You kill me, I kill you, we both go to heaven.
You might have to help me out with the last ten or so because Mr. Happy gets tired- religion.
Well, we're gonna come down there and take all your oil.
Yeah, but I think I'm gonna enjoy this even more.
So, we just gonna sit here and talk or are we gonna do it?
We're two Asian businessmen looking to invest in McBurgertown Industries and we'd like a tour of your facility.
Well, I guess we'll just take our millions of Dongs elsewhere.
Peter, what the hell do you expect to accomplish here?
I'm gonna find just the right piece of incriminating evidence to bring down this company.
At that time, our value meal consisted of a hamburger, a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.
I have to go to the bathroom for about 30 minutes as I eat a lot of meat.
Please give me your word that you won't go in that door.
Like cow, so it's kind of a... eh, sort of a dark joke.
They have killed a great many of us, including my beloved wife.
If we can get you out of here, would you be willing to testify publicly about these atrocities?
Well, you've effectively ended my reign of coolness, haven't you?
But, before I go, could I maybe have one last kiss?
The McBurgertown franchise suffered a publicity setback today from which it may not recover, thanks to testimony regarding its practices by a very brave cow.
I have revealed to you, today, these horrors in the hope that you will see the need for change.
But always remember what I have done here today is not a courageous act.
The courage lies with a man who has the guts to say no to a fast food restaurant and eat a salad instead.
I don't care if I look like a gay person.
And thank you, Peter, for all you've done to help expose this grave injustice.
I just said Maybe, if it was okay with Lois.
Boy, it just it seems like a real burden to me.
My essay won first prize in the New England 'Rising Writers' contest.
I'm going to be honoured with a big ceremony in Martha's Vineyard. they are going to put me up in luxury hotel, all expenses paid.
Over a thousand people entered the contest and they chose mine.
Just like the first chemotherapy patient to figure out the handkerchief look.
We're gonna be late for lunch with Mom and Dad.
Let me just go change out of this fishing gear.
We got to go now. Come on, Joe! Joe! Quagmire!
I'm afraid that on my way to the bedroom to change,
Uh... because my stomach is rumbling in a way that sounds like the engine of Joe's fishing truck.
You promised you'd come to lunch with my parents today.
Well, Lois, until we get an appointment secretary, things like this are gonna continue to fall through the cracks.
You know they're still angry at how you behaved at our wedding.
But he promised he'd go with me to put flowers on my grandmother's grave this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.
So, uh, a lot of tension with Peter lately, huh?
But tonight is our sex night, and a little physical release will do us both some good.
Lois, I know it's late, but me and the guys were going beekeeping.
Oh, my God, what the hell is wrong with you?!
Whoa, someone just yelled themselves out of honey with breakfast.
I don't need honey, Peter, I need a husband who wants to spend time with me.
All you two have done is argue about stuff for the past two weeks.
Why don't you come out to Martha's Vineyard and watch me accept my award.
Can't we just do something fun here at the house?
Hey, guys, I've decided I'm gonna take up the drums.
Look, Quagmire, we're only gonna be on Martha's Vineyard for a couple days.
Aw, man, you're more of a letdown than Fruit Stripe gum.
What are we gonna do, Lois? re out of town.
Well, wait a minute, what about that nice old man who lives up the street?
So it would only be till Monday and we could pay you for it.
You know, the overprivileged drunk ones, not the socially responsible dead ones.
Your bird intelligence is no match for my people intelligence.
All right, children, your mammy and pappy asked me to look after you for the next couple days.
So I want to lay down a few ground rules.
No cussing, clean your plates, and only a half hour of radio and then it's off to bed.
And don't you mouth off to me or I'm gonna slap you right in your penis.
No offense, Mr. Herbert, but I'm a 17-year-old girl and I don't need you here.
Well, no offense to you, Meg, but you're a 17-year-old girl and I don't need you here.
I hope he gets here before they give you your award.
And now, reading a passage from his grand prize-winning short essay, Amazing Grace, tonight's guest of honor,
Thank you very much. She was grace in name and in essence. To those she loved, she exuded strength, life, laughter and light. And to me, also sorrow. For circumstance had bound her to my best friend, through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home. Nothing from the first day I saw her and no one that has happened to me since has ever been as frightening and as confusing. For no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important and less significant.
Well, you know what they say- write what's in your heart.
Every time that we go to a hotel, you hide the key to the minibar from me.
You had an opportunity to share a beautiful moment with Brian and you wasted it, wasted it like the Osmond family wastes water.
So the shower's just running with no one in there?
Almost as potent as the inspiration you give me to plumb the deepest fathoms of my soul for a literary bounty of truth and loveliness.
Oh, well, then, maybe Brian and I can hang out.
Good, now can you move, please? You're blocking the screen.
Know anybody with a pair of strong, young hands to help me in and out of the tub?
Oh, I'd love to, but Peter and I were gonna get dinner at that little place by the...
How about we just order room service and watch a couple of bad movies?
Ah, this is gonna be great- a whole evening with Lois!
Couple of steaks, some wine, maybe a couple of sundaes...
Hey, Brian, it's me. I got a question for you.
Well, it's a Saturday night- sorry the video store pickings were a little sparse.
I saved all my scraps in a bag for you.
Thanks. You know, Lois, I'm sure you've already figured this out, but... that essay I wrote- I wrote it about you.
Well, you know, Lois, you mean a lot to me.
I mean, things you say and things you do resonate with me in a big way.
And then when I hear that car coming up the driveway, I just go berserk.
I mean, you know, half the time, when you go to the market,
I just assume you're leaving forever, and when you get back,
I realize I have no idea how long you've been gone, and I...
I know you're married to Peter, but I love you and
Look, Stewie, I can't talk about this now, all right?
I did a bad thing, and I don't know what to do about it.
I- I should tell you that that vagina is ground zero, man.
There was even room to twirl a cane as I strolled.
Were you down at that hotel bar all night again?
I was, Lois- and you know who's staying at this hotel?
We got wasted at the bar, and he ended up asking me to marry him.
So I convinced this minister to do the job, but the joke's on Nathan Lane,
Oh, I'm intoxicated all right, Lois- by the beauty and magic of Martha's Vineyard.
Nantucket, Cape Cod, and all the great destinations that make Massachusetts the wondrous place it is.
I am so glad Brian brought us out here, Lois.
Was he bigger than me? ... and they told Peter to stay away from the wolf.
And he knew that sometimes the things that seem the most dangerous turn out to be the most fun!
Yes, sir, it was a good day for young Peter.
Lois is my wife, and... well, I mean, all the dry food I've bought for you over the years?
She does nothing but give and give and give, and you repay her with selfishness and neglect.
I mean, you've barely spent any time with her at all on this vacation.
Well, who the hell are you to tell me how to run my marriage?
You can't even hang on to a girlfriend for more than a couple months!
Oh, you're a freakin' train wreck with that crap, Brian.
You couldn't even get Gillian to take you back, and she was dumber than Lou Ferrigno.
It's just... wh-when you have feelings for someone that are strong enough, you just...
I don't know, lose sight of the rest of the world.
I promise, Peter, nothing like this will ever happen again.
Now, get ready, we're having dinner with my parents tonight!
Well,yes. I mean, you and I have a lot in common, and we've spent so much time together over the years, and... of course, that essay you wrote, oh, it really touched my heart.
Well, to be honest, Lois, I ripped off most of that speech from Summer of '42.
When these thoughts about you and I have crossed your mind, is it... good?
But with you, I imagine it would be like doing it with a stuffed animal.
Well, we may be leaving Martha's Vineyard, but the spirit of this wonderful place will stay in our hearts all the way home.
Hey, you guys want to buy some gum or cotton candy or a stuffed animal?
You can hit your friend on the head with it.
Coming up, important traffic news that can't help you because you're some place where a TV is.
But first, get ready, Quahog, because Barry Manilow will be performing this weekend at the Quahog Performing Arts Center.
Yeah, if you're in the right mood. Daybreak is a good song.
Yeah, that's a good one. Looks Like We Made It.
With you Been living with nothing to show for it
You get what you get when you go for it
I'm gonna need some help from a member of the audience.
All right, why don't you come up and join me on the stage?
You know he wrote all those Kentucky Fried Chicken jingles.
I say, I says on, what do we got brewing in here?
I was walking by when I picked up the smell of 11 herbs and spice... agh!
Look at that boy, running all around like a chicken with its head cut...
So come on down to the Hydrox Arena this Sunday, Sunday!
Aw, crap, I must've dropped it at the Barry Manilow concert.
Agh, Peter,you and your excuses for losing your wallet. I dropped it at the concert. The hooker took it. It's with my other family.
And let me tell you something, they appreciate me for who I am.
No, and it's getting to be a pain in the ass.
I couldn't even afford to get my hair cut yesterday.
Yeah, well, guess there'snothing you can do about it now.
Uh, yes, I'd like to rent this copy of Garden State.
I hear what you're saying, Lois, but unlike my credit card,
A big screen TV,a massage chair from Sharper Image,plane tickets...
Whoever the thief is, he's spending less than my wife.
How are we gonna figure out who has your credit card?
Get the scent and then find the guy that smells like me.
You stole my credit card, you son of a bitch.
Well, I locked you in a wooden crate and forgot to put an air hole in it.
I told him to leave, but he keeps saying he lives here.
I say, this is more uncomfortable than having James Brady at a cocktail party.
Right, so I got my hand gun and I'm just randomly firing it into a crowd of people and then...
No, no, I'm anxious to hear the conclusion of your story.
Hello, Officer. Would you be kind enough to remove this trespasser from my home?
I know, Lois, but this man has all the paperwork.
I hate to have to do this, but I'm afraid legally I have no choice.
I don't care what the law says, you're not Peter Griffin, you're James Woods.
I should've warned you, she can be a real bitch in the morning.
Not like the fake thrill of running into your ex-girlfriend on the street.
You know, you're not supposed to be in the house, Brian.
For God's sake, I went to Brown and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
This rope was a lot longer, and now it's somehow gotten shorter.
I gave James Woods your novel to read, and you're not gonna believe this.
I gotta tell you though, there was some weird stuff going on over there today.
And that's why I contend that when Frost speaks of birch trees, he may very well be talking about himself.
You wanna hear my interpretation, or are you simply going to tell me that I'm wrong?
But this is poetry we're talking about, and I think when it comes to poetry, you can't be wrong.
If James Woods sees you, he's gonna call the cops.
I miss my family, Brian, and I gotta see 'em.
Either you leave now... or I set up one of your random flashbacks.
And I'll set up all the flashbacks, just like I used to.
Like the time I swallowed that midget who played Mini-Me just so I could make you laugh.
Oh, yeah. In fact... my stomach has been talking to me all day.
I said my stomach has been talking to me all day.
Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois- if my stomach had said,Hell yeah I'm hungry.
James Woods is destroying this family, and all just to get back at Peter.
I know, he's doing all the stuff Dad usually does.
Now, Meg, you want to be thin like all the Hollywood starlets, right?
Well, I've got a way that you can eat all you want and look like a Hollywood starlet.
Gosh, Mr. Pukey, you sure are good at making fat women hot.
You think you could help out my friend Meg here?
Now close your eyes, Meg, and let Mr. Pukey help you out.
Mr. Woods, how do I get a girl to like me?
Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I had the same coke supplier, and he threw a punch social one day and we both happened to be there.
Next thing you know, we're both in the back room, slam-bang.
I know, Peter,but identity theft is one of the hardest things to fight.
A much better idea than when I did magic for the blind.
A week from tomorrow, it'll be 20 years we've been married.
You know, Scooter, we don't allow hats at the dinner table.
Get out of my house right now, you son of a bitch.
If he's Peter Griffin, then that means you can be James Woods.
If I was a famous movie star, I wouldn't even want my family.
No, no, Peter,I'm saying you can do to him what he did to you.
And I'll stick to that story,even if nobody believes it.
The question is, Brian, how am I gonna make people think I'm James Woods?
The first thing we're gonna do is get you a perfect fake I.D.
It's just... you're so attractive and it's been a while.
You know, some people say that's good for your hair.
So, uh, now, let me understand this, what are you here to promote, James?
Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie coming out on HBO next month.
It's all about 9-11. he movie's called September 11, 2000-Fun.
I play a window washer who has just finished washing the last window of the World Trade Center.
And then I turn around to get off the scaffold, and what do you think I see coming?
You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face, and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
Well, our top story continues to be the fall of actor James Woods, who almost overnight has gone from America's most beloved celebrity to America's most hated pariah.
Ooh, a piece of candy. Ooh, a piece of candy.
Okay, Brian, next time let's remember this right away, because he's done this twice.
Hey, you guys want to buy some gum or cotton candy or a stuffed animal?
You can hit your friend on the head with it.
Coming up, important traffic news that can't help you because you're some place where a TV is.

Not like the fake thrill of running into your ex-girlfriend on the street.
You know, you're not supposed to be in the house, Brian.
For God's sake, I went to Brown and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
This rope was a lot longer, and now it's somehow gotten shorter.
I gave James Woods your novel to read, and you're not gonna believe this.
I gotta tell you though, there was some weird stuff going on over there today.
And that's why I contend that when Frost speaks of birch trees, he may very well be talking about himself.
You wanna hear my interpretation, or are you simply going to tell me that I'm wrong?
But this is poetry we're talking about, and I think when it comes to poetry, you can't be wrong.
If James Woods sees you, he's gonna call the cops.
I miss my family, Brian, and I gotta see 'em.
Either you leave now... or I set up one of your random flashbacks.
And I'll set up all the flashbacks, just like I used to.
Like the time I swallowed that midget who played Mini-Me just so I could make you laugh.
Oh, yeah. In fact... my stomach has been talking to me all day.
I said my stomach has been talking to me all day.
Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois- if my stomach had said,Hell yeah I'm hungry.
James Woods is destroying this family, and all just to get back at Peter.
I know, he's doing all the stuff Dad usually does.
Now, Meg, you want to be thin like all the Hollywood starlets, right?
Well, I've got a way that you can eat all you want and look like a Hollywood starlet.
Gosh, Mr. Pukey, you sure are good at making fat women hot.
You think you could help out my friend Meg here?
Now close your eyes, Meg, and let Mr. Pukey help you out.
Mr. Woods, how do I get a girl to like me?
Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I had the same coke supplier, and he threw a punch social one day and we both happened to be there.
Next thing you know, we're both in the back room, slam-bang.
I know, Peter,but identity theft is one of the hardest things to fight.
A much better idea than when I did magic for the blind.
A week from tomorrow, it'll be 20 years we've been married.
You know, Scooter, we don't allow hats at the dinner table.
Get out of my house right now, you son of a bitch.
If he's Peter Griffin, then that means you can be James Woods.
If I was a famous movie star, I wouldn't even want my family.
No, no, Peter,I'm saying you can do to him what he did to you.
And I'll stick to that story,even if nobody believes it.
The question is, Brian, how am I gonna make people think I'm James Woods?
The first thing we're gonna do is get you a perfect fake I.D.
It's just... you're so attractive and it's been a while.
You know, some people say that's good for your hair.
So, uh, now, let me understand this, what are you here to promote, James?
Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie coming out on HBO next month.
It's all about 9-11. he movie's called September 11, 2000-Fun.
I play a window washer who has just finished washing the last window of the World Trade Center.
And then I turn around to get off the scaffold, and what do you think I see coming?
You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face, and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
Well, our top story continues to be the fall of actor James Woods, who almost overnight has gone from America's most beloved celebrity to America's most hated pariah.
Ooh, a piece of candy. Ooh, a piece of candy.
Okay, Brian, next time let's remember this right away, because he's done this twice.
Es con mucho dolor que digamos adios a Javier.. y Pepe y Carlos y Lupe, y otra Lu
No, wait. He was either wounded or killed. don't remember.
Well, it seems his lungs are completely filled with Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation.
One-third of his body weight is Owens-Corning fiberglass insulation. llth'st.
But don't worry, he won't burn in hell thanks to all that
I don't know why, but I've always found magic very sexy.
Any chance I can hire you to do your act?
It's like listening to those two foreign guys down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU. almost long enough to sound American.
Oh, man, what a good bunch of partying at that discotheque. eylad e mauence requests.
Any more and I would have ended up in hospital, man.
Ohyosa ifrnd to stay 'cause I almost hadsex on this girl.
And if I've donethis right, then this isyour car Swi
Listen, I'll beyour assistant, and we'll put on a whole big show.
Well, I am still a little shaky onsome of this stuff.
Great. And we'll get youa wand, a top hat and a cape.
In fact, you can usePeter's cape from last year'sHaeen costume.
Can't be my pointy teeth, 'cause those areall the way up here.
I'm unemployed, but that makes her feel usefulin the relationship. m nnfihi
If he had his life together, I wouldn'tbe into it.
Well, this was a lot of effortfor nothing... like trying to tellMatthew McConaughey how much he sucks.
You know, Matthew, I-I may not ever getotr an to say this,so I just want to get this offmy chest.
You're one of the worst actors t hto ofi.. ...and I think that you needto go away.
The truth is I spendat least 90% of my year going away exploringexotic places, having sex with mybeautiful girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.
Money that I made off thteib fmsat I put out into the American populacebecause they just love to see me doing whatit is that I do.
Contact, they didn'teven need u tt vi They could have donethe whole movie without you.
I know. I know. I saidthe same thing. but they're just, like, Oh, we need agood-looking guy with a greaasanso thtbs to just provide some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.
Said the, saidthe same thing about that Bill Murrayelephant movie, but they were just, like,Oh, theudnc nd u.
You make me physicallysick to my stomach, and I wish that you would get aheart attack.
Truth of the mte isI n'li my movies either, but, man, they justkeep offering me money and I do it and I getto go around the world.
I mean, didyou see Sahara? te you whatthe move gave me was an opportunity to take an
Airstreamall across the country and sell that pictureone person at a time.
I mean, look atall the stuff I t se toujust to get laid.
Try anan She was the greatest girl I ever met,and I blew it.
It happened onnumerous occasions, and I was too idto tell anyone because I felt likesomehow it w mfat.
Wow, you sure look...different than the last timeI saw you. ahhacu
So to get out of hereI just make a left out of the driveway and drive as fastas I can?
There's someoneI've wanted you to meet for a long time.
I wanted you to meet Dylanfor a long time, Brian.
Yeah, sort of a weird commentrit fntf l u Kinda thoughtthis was a team effort.
Yeah, you're, like,five minutes from gone and you leave with that?
You know, it's likecutting a huge fart and then walkingout of the room.
Nice kid. Say, Brian,now that I think about it, how can you possible havea 13-year-old son enouourselfare only seven?
If you don't like it, go on the Internetand complain.
I'm telling you, I couldn't get outof there fast enough.
Boy, Brian, youdodged a bullet not having toraise that kid.
Your life would havebeen more miserable than a lonely old widow livingin a downstairs apartment.
Hey, Lois, I didn't even knowI had a son until today.
My mom wanted meto give you this. To Brian from Tracy.He's your obm w. P.S. Will you write mea letter of recommendation for the
No. No, I'm not gonna t se othli like that.
No, my pants just got shorter'cause I hated the idea.
Shut up, dude. You'rejust a fat old bastard. ll, not to get technical,sir, but you are the bastard.
He made her watc thotr 8 urof Monty Python stuff that isn't funnyor memorable.
I have a pet hedgehog named Zippy and I shall walk her to town, and each time my foot hits the ground, I shall say, Boing, boing, boing. m gi!
Hey, Dylan. Hey, come on in here for a sec.
Oh, just a little something I do once a week around here ll aak t party.
That's something that interests you, my friend? u' wrd Yeah, and you're attractive
I just woke up from anap and I feel drafty.
Oh, damn it, Dylan.What the hell? llthk dI'm full of Play-Doh.
That's it. I'mtelling Brian he has to reign Dylan inonce and for all.
Dylan put this paperbaony ad and I could not, for the life of me, figure out howto get it off.
I am gonna kick himout of this house faster than NASA kicked outthe Cocoa Puffs bird.
This isn't working out Alrit? don't carethat I'm your father, and you don't care that you're my son.
I think it's best if you just get out of this house.
And then in chapter 28 of my novel, the other pilots finally trust the Japanese pilot and let him, let him into... their group.
Hey. Hey, what if, um, there were a Korean pilot?
Yeah. Um, I'm not really looking for notes, but you know, Dylan, I gotta tell you something.
I'm sorry I wasn't around when you were growing up.
If-if I had known having a son could be like this...
It's okay. Look, I know I wasn't there for you man, for all those years, but...that's gonna change.
And I'm gonna make you into a better person, starting first thing tomorrow.
Was somebody looking for a son with a bright new path to adulthood and his very, very proud Dad?
From now on, I plan on being a real father to Dylan, and together, we are gonna turn his life around.
Oh. We got a young Adam Sandler here, I think.
I am now in possession of hundreds of palettes of crudely painted, not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art, and it's just waiting to transform your uncut, trash-strewn lawn into a living canvas that tells passers-by, Hey, everyone, a real funny bugler lives here.
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly, and motorists will slow down and applaud when they cast their eyes on such favorites as...
Fat Woman Bending Over Tending to her Garden in Big,
Most of this stuff is price to move and until it does, it's an enormous fire hazard, so please, come see me, on Route 2 in Weekapaug.
Look for the Sort-of Ben and Jerry's Cow out front!
We interrupt this program to bring you grim news out of
LaGuardia airport, where a 767 has been forced to make a crash landing.
Oh, man, I tell you, now that I'm a parent,
I just think, you know, I just think, Oh, my God, what if Dylan were on that plane?
Oh, my God, oh, I just don't know what I would do.
Until you have a child... Until you have a child, you do not understand. Okay?
Watch this: Hey, Brian, what would you do if Dylan fell out a window?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God I don't even want to think about that.
Brian, what would you do if Dylan was in a fire?
Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, that's...
I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's had never even told him he had a kid.
Tricking her should be easier than escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.
I just, I just, I don't want Dylan eating white bread.
Lois. Lois, Lois I will decide what is best for my child, all right?
And, and, I do not want to have this conversation in front of my son.
Go up to my jewelry box, take my gold jewelry.
Melt it down. Make it into bread and feed him that.
You said we were going to The Price is Right.
Now Dylan can go back with his mom, and you can stop acting like such a jackass.
I must say, you have been a little insufferable lately, Brian.
Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have been acting different lately, all right?
But that's only because I've truly connected with the one bit of flesh and blood that I have on this earth.
Look at her. She needs me- a lot more than you do.
But we were just starting to make a real connection.
I'll always be grateful to you for turning my life around, but now, thanks to you, I finally have a chance to transform my mom's life in the same way you transformed mine.
You know, I guess a dad couldn't ask for more than that.
My life will never be the same for knowing you.
.:: Family Guy - S06E12 ::. .:: Long John Peter ::.
They charge me 90 bucks a day to keep Brian here.
For 60 bucks I can put him over to Holiday-In.
Eh, look at that, Lois. That's why cats freak me out.
He's doing that weird, stretchy leg thing. When they lick themselves.
Oh, thank god the vets are here to help Brian.
You're gonna gain a 150 pounds and write ugly bety fan fiction.
You do not see that these days. You do not see that.
You know you never really know what someboy thinks of you.
Hey you should come home and spend the night at my house.
Get off my back. I thought it was indian food.
Oh, thank you so much for your help, Dr. Jewish.
I never wanted anyone like this It's all brand new
We now return to busy business lady, whose life is missing something, but she doesn't realize it, because she's so busy with business.
I've got a different business meeting at 3:00, and we will doing business there.
I've got a lunch meeting and then a meeting after lunch.
I'd like to show you that all your problems can be solved by my penis.
Ehehe. Ain't that funny? He heard me say that on the way over in the cab.
W-Wait, we had the radio on and we were talking about some goofy stuff.
Hey Peter, you kind of look like a pirat with that thing on your shoulder.
And you should have sex with that crossing guard, even though she looked young and then i found out she was 12.
Mom, can we go back to the vet and see the pretty vet assistant again?
Fetch me five tankards of ale and a leg of mutton for me maties!
Just a few sea dogs from my fishin' boat days.
After we've had our fill of bread and wine, we shall tell tales of other times we had our fill of bread and wine.
God, this is a more disturbing sight then Tom Hanks and E.T. in Philadelphia.
Ahaaa. 'Tis Long John Peter and his merry men come seeking plunder.
I'm going to fire this canon all over your store. Hahahahaha.
We'll see to it that no child ever received these as a last minute gift hastily bought on the way to the party.
I've got to get this shipment of sugarcane, tobacco and spices to the harbor before day's end.
Well, Shelley Booth bishop isn't about to let you over-egg this pudding.
I said, shoot it again. But I said it pirate like.
I've screwed up worse than Disney did when they cast Michael J. Fox in that Zorro remake.
Well, he convulsed a lot and fell of the operating table.
Then a passing nurse accidentally stepped on him and kicked him into a puddle of urin, which must have frightened him, because his bowels released all over himself.
I tried to pick him up, but then I got angry because some of it got on my thump.
So I threw him against the wall and that's where he died.
He'll get over it pretty quickly and then move on to another wacky thing.
But I bet a lot of girls tell you that, huh?
Well, the only girl I know is my sister and she sucks!
Listen, I have to get back to work but, um, would you maybe wanna go out sometime?
So, um... how do you like working at the vet?
Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved working with animals.
Did you ever make it with one of the dogs?
Oh, uhm, I mean, did you ever make it with one of the dogs?
You know, Anna when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful girl in the world.
And now all I wanna do is show you my innermost self but I'm afraid you'll reject me, because you won't like what you see.
Or that you'll see my scrotum, and see that it has a seam on it, and then you'll think I'm made up of two different guys that were sewn together,
When I'm around a pretty girl, I'll get all worked up, like a kid watching a toy commercial.
I went on a date with this girl, that I really like, and, if you don't mind, I was hoping I could ask you a few questions, about the birds and the bees?
Chris, would you always wanna remeber, is that sex is perfectly natural.
Whoa, uh, uh,sorry, Mr. Swanson. Um, I wasn't really talking to you.
Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories, but I was kind of hoping to get some advice from someone who isn't broken from the waist down.
I have tons and tons of dogs to incinerate, but I can't wait to see you tomorrow night.
Oh, uh, that's okay, I'll get it, have fun at work.
You, a man, are cleaning up a mess made by Anna, a woman, that she, also a woman, spilled on you, a man.
If you want to get anywhere with a chick, you can't treat 'em too nice-like.
The next time you see this girl, treat her like crap.
And you'll be cooler than a mid '80s novelty answering machine message.
I'm gald you called, but im not home, but I'll be back before too long,
You gotta wait for the beep, you gotta leave your name, you gotta leave your number, wait for the beep!
Ah yes, can I have two tickets, one man and one bitch that needs to do what I say.
Pick that up and cook it into something delicious or knit it into something that's useful to me!
Why in the world I wanan do that after what you just said?
Hey Chris, guess what we just did? Bonny, tell him.
Oh-ho, she dumped you, that's what you meant to say.
What you said first was, what... well, I mean, what when two grown-ups love each other very much.
Uch, I should've known that Peter had something to do with this.
You're not the first person whose life he screwed up.
Oh, he was going to ask me to be un usher.
I mean, he already had enough grooms man, so he made me an usher.
But just to think I could be involved in the ceremony in any way!
You told Chris to act like a jerk to this girl?!
I don't know, I mean, I-I thought I was helping.
'cause now Chris is all sad and crying and fat and bad at sports.
Well, you created this mess and you have to help him fix it.
Man, parenting is more complicated then making a 1940s phone call.
Poked some holes in its bag so it can breathe.
I know how you feel, son but u can't give up now.
Now let's get out there and meet some ladies, eh?
Chris, you don't want to miss out on experiencing your teenage years.
If you do, you'll feel as bad as I do when I miss the toilet.
I fact, I think she'll be coming through that door.
I'm from the rich part of town, so you know I'm a good egg.
Have you giving any thoughts to what you might be getting him?
Ohh, I don't know if he would want one of those.
Chris, this is Barbara, the girl from your class you used to have a crush on.
Now, you kids enjoy yourselves and I'll create some atmosphere.
I dont' understand Chris, your Blind Date should be here by now, she answered the ad.
I know Dad's been trying to help and I'm trying to listen to him but nothing seems to be working.
Well, I know, I asked him to help but it occurs to me that you've been taking advice from everyone except the one person who matters.
All I want is to go out with Anna again.
Then you just need to go talk to her and tell her exactly how you feel.
But she's sad, she never wants to see me again.
Well, I'm sure you can come up with some excuse to see her at the vet.
I came here 'cause I wanted to apologize for acting like such a jerk.
Oh yeah, no, no, no yet, no, you're, you're, you're a cool guy.
I wanted to make sure I didn't do anything wrong.
Family Guy Saison 7 Episode 1 : Love Blactually (V.O)
Come on kids, people are gonna start showing up for the costume party any minute.
You can punch snoopy in the stomach as hard as you can and he won't feel it.
No, i just do quirky things for the sake of being quirky.
You strike me as someone i wouldn't enjoy but others might.
Oh, you know this is why you, Brian, remember? the last couple of weeks i kept saying:
Can I have a couple minutes of your time to talk to you about something?
Are-are you just trying to piss me off, or is that really how you say that?
What are you talking about? I'm talking about this ru-ined evening.
What do you call the remains of ancient greek structures.
Oh, you mean like if he dove into the shallow end?
Brian, there's that girl from our yoga class I wanted you to meet.
Now, look Lois, I appreciate it, but I..I'm not into fix-ups.
Oh come on, you gotta get yourself back out there.
Oh Brian, Lois has told me so much about you.
Did you know that Democrats murder thousands of babies every year?
And sometimes babies are put back into the womb just so that they can be aborted again?
Yeah, have a good evening. Come on, buddy, lets go.
I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl who loves abortion as much as you do.
That's not the point, Stewie. I'm just... tired of every girl I meet beeing crazy.
Now, come on, let's forget our problems and get lost in the world of books.
Ooh! Horton Hears Domestic Violence in the Next Apartment and Doesn't Call 911
I don't think it's easy, but, yes, I do think you like it!
No, I, yeah, I like being away from you, 'cause I can't stand looking at you!
Hey, you think I wanna do that?! You think I wanna hurt you?!
I don't wanna hurt you! You make me hurt you!
I-I don't think you want this book, It's all about atheism.
Tell you what, how about I take it and then send it after i read it.
Geez, Brian, you've been going to the mail every day for a week, what are you looking for?
You haven't even open the one that came for you a week ago.
You idiot! What didn't you tell me this was here?
My hat kept blowing away so i put the package on it so i wouldn't loose it.
That's the dumbest think I've ever heard, you don't wear a hat and there's no wind in here.
You know huh... I was really glad you sent me the book.
I won't lie to you, I came this close to praying that I'd see you again.
Can I interest you folks in some of our heavenly cheesecake?
No, but I'll have some of your There is no after-life Souffl.
I love being a part of things. I'll bring your dessert now.
You know Carolyn, I rarely find myself connected with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your compagny.
The bell I rang to prove that I was strong
Stewie, have you been hiding in the back all evening?
You almost went in there and tried to have sex with that girl.
You always try too soon and end up blowing it.
I-I do, I-I always try and jump into the sex right away.
Good job Brian, don't worry I'll help you through this.
Can we go some place where the menus have pictures of the food?
OH LET'S GO SOME PLACE WHERE THE MENUS HAVE PICTURES OF FOOD!
Yeah... You knew it was gonna be a touching comedy because Robin Williams had a beard.
My back is so stiff from sitting in that theater chair.
You know I huh... took a Tha massage class at the Learning Annex.
'Course I'll tell you what would really set you right is uh... couple of Aleves and a good night's sleep.
You gonna take a ride out in the country and let the AIDS blow through your hair?
We've been going out for three weeks and I haven't tried anything.
Even though she's been giving me some pretty strong signals.
So, do you have any thoughts on what you might wanna do tonight?
I don't know Brian, you don't want to mess things up.
Alright, but just one last piece of advice: Remember, listen to her body, and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you.
Oh hey Brian, close that window you're letting all the stink out.
I don't believe this. Cleveland you're sleeping with my girlfriend.
Carolyn what are you talking about? We've been dating for three weeks.
Well, you never made a move on me so I thought you just wanted to be friends.
And I met Cleveland, and, things just kinda took off.
She started going on about her new brazilian wax and not wearing any underpants and whatnot.
I'd have to be a homosexual to ignore a signal like that.
But, Carolyn, you completely misunderstood me... I wanted you like crazy, but...
I just figured if I showed a little restraint you'd respect me.
Now why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something.
Guess she should have hit that when you had the chance Brian.
What? you are the one who told me to wait !
Yeah, well thanks to you, I lost her to Cleveland.
You need to stop pointing fingers, and get out of the house, have some fun!
Real fun, not like thirty-seven year-old woman on a Blind Date fun.
I mean, so what if you forgot your wallet, I'll pay. I'm gonna pay for us.
You'll get it next time, yeah. So you're impressive right? killed a man.
You tell the best stories. Me and my three eggs are having the best time.
I know what always make me feel better. Delicious sweets.
Oh, you know, I can just wash if off when I get home.
Ok look, next time we'll go to another store, how about that?
Just... forget her alright? I just want to sit here watch the ball game and have a few beers.
There appears to be a interracial couple making love on second base.
The crowd's enjoying it and it looks like the Empire's gonna let them finish.
I'll tell you what this would be painful to watch if you love that girl.
Boy what are the odds of running into Cleveland and Carolyn everywhere we went, huh?
Well, as long as we just stay here in the house we're safe, right?
Yeah Cleveland, she's way more fun than that wife you used to have.
You know it's amazing Cleveland, you went from a black woman to a white woman without having to take a hispanic woman step in between.
If we can get her back with Cleveland, Carolyn's all yours.
That's a long shot. But so was the shouting Arab Gram business.
You know what, this is never gonna work, Stewie. Loretta cheated on
Cleveland. She's not gonna want to go back to him.
Oh, she can be convinced, Brian. Just let me do the talking.
She's only gonna get the gist of what you're saying.
Really? Isn't she one of those people outside the family who can understand me?
No, I think because of Cleveland, she's close enough to the main cast
Well, I get the gist of what you're saying, Stewie.
But I can never go back to Cleveland. Not after all the pain I cause him.
Hey Brian, d'you see that treadmill in the living room?
I didn't reconize you without my girlfriend wrapped around your waist.
She and I are both to a point of great soreness.
Listen, I just wanna clear any bad feelings you may have about me and Carolyn.
I guess it's okay. These are passing flings, nothing to get upset about.
You got a problem with that, you can go fuck yourself.
Cleveland, I've been doing some thinking lately about how much I miss you.
I want us to be together again as a family, and
I'm no meteorologist, but I'm pretty sure it's rainin' bitches.
I-I don't know what to do. Carolyn and I are supposed to elope tomorrow.
But here comes Loretta all apologetic and wanting to get our family back together and whatnot.
I wouldn't forgive her so fast Cleveland. Remember she slept with Quagmire.
Well, just-just wait a minute you guys, let's not be so quick to demonize Loretta, I mean...
Oh, you just want Cleveland out of the picture, so you can get back with Carolyn.
That-that's not it at all. I-I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful with her sassy wisdom and speedbag arm fat.
I guess at the very least i could go talk to her tomorrow and see how I feel.
But overall, Loretta is a delightful person, very pleasant to be around, and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
You know there might be a way to drive the point home that she hasn't changed.
Would you mind getting Loretta to sleep with you again?
Well we're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good and that he can't trust her and if he catches you guys in the act
Oh, Oh Ok, Ok I'm with you now... I can probably work that in.
This is perfect Lois. We'll expose Loretta for who she is.
In spite of the fact that your people control a disproportion in amount of the world's wealth.
And in all likelihood are probably responsible for starting every major war since the dawn of t...
We have a club sandwich, a fruit plate and a sight of HOT BEEF STEAK!
Oh, you can't resist the Q man and my superpower Genitalia.
I'm a changed woman. I don't mess with your kind anymore.
But everybody's been telling me i'm wearing magnificent robes made from the finest silk.
Oh come here baby. Have you thought about what I said?
I came over here wanting to believe that there was still a chance for us.
But, on the way, i passed a lake, skipped a few rocks and had some black-guy thinking time.
Loretta, we lived certain parts of our lives in the past for a reason.
What you and I, you can go ahead and put you clothes back on.
What you and I have was a wonderful thing. and as much as I still have a great deal of love for you, our time is over.
Isn't there anything I can do to make you happy.
Live it as full and as wonderful as you can.
Brian, do you think you could identify a genital wart?
I... I-I-I... I-I would think that would be something you'd check with your doctor about.
Family Guy Season 7 Episode 2 I dream of Jesus
You know kids, there's a lot of history here. These 50's diners were very popular in the 80's.
Not like last night when I didn't have time to poop before the guests arrived.
Do I have time? You know what, I'm gonna go for it.
Son of a bitch! Looks like I'm gonna have to pile all dinner on top of... He guys how are you!
Look at  this place. They don't serve any of this 1950's food anymore.
Hamburgers, french fries, cokes. He-he, you kids don't know what I'm talking about.
I love how all the service look like celebrities from the 50's.
Marilyn Monroe. Elvis. And look there's James Dean after the accident.
Oh yeah Chris. Polio back then was like AIDS today. Except people who have polio get in to heaven.
Oh my God! This is Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen. This is my favorite song of all time.
Hey, guy behind the counter, the bird is the word!
This song from the 1960's, it shouldn't be in this jukebox.
Wait wait! Can I have that record? I love that song.
I don't know, let's see what you daughter looks like.
Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?
Peter will you give this song a rest? You've been playing it ever since we've got home.
No way Lois, it's my new favorite thing in the world.
Do you or do you not know about the bird?
Huh... That's odd I thought that would be big news.
Well there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.
A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avion variety
It was my understanding that everyone had heard. heard what? Brian, don't!
Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.
That's almost everything we have! What the hell was it for?
I bought some local TV air time, Lois, and I did a public service announcement of vital importance.
You know there's an issue facing many americans today that I know concerns a great number of us.
According to Gallup polls one in twelve americans is unaware that the bird is the word.
I've for one dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.
Sir! Our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.
All right, that's it! We gotta do something about this.
We have got to get that record and destroy it.
Just like that fat person surgery destroyed Star Jones's arms.
Coming to show to people how I said how I look.
I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.
You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record.
And that's why you wanted the record out of the way.
Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.
But Meg didn't count on me discovering she has no twin sister.
You won't fire Chris, you don't got the stomach for it.
I'm sorry dad, I've no idea what  you're talking about.
Well, it sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away.
If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I try to split.
There's a lot of jews out there still get a laugh of a hello mother, hello father.
Whoo, such heat this morning I don't need this jacket.
Well, a hell with all of you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin' Bird.
Peter that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.
No, I'm sorry. A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.
Damn it, this is third used record store with that same story.
You are... You look familiar. Do I, do I know you?
No, I'm not. I'm just a guy working at a record store.
Huh! Well if you're not Jesus Christ, then you won't mind if I pee on this Amy Grant CD's.
Jesus Christ has returned to earth. I can't believe it.
Will you keep it down? It's not the second coming.
Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so.
Plus the timing seemed good, 'cause my dad just quit smoking and is a little on edge.
Who took my checkbook? Helen! Why is there a pen cap and no pen?
You're the first person to recognize me in two thousand years.
You seem like a nice guy. Hey won't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?
Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat we can watch that youtube footage of xx xx calling moviephone.
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW. xxxx.
Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW. xxxxx.
If this is the movie you'd like to see, say yes NOW.
Wow! Jesus Christ at our dinner table. I still can't get over it.
I wanted tell you that one of you will betray me.
He's doing that thing he did in this story book.
Oh, all right. So there I was. They just beaten me senseless. Stuck thorns in my head.
Nailed me to the piece of wood. Shoved the spunch full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me.
Then they put me into a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.
Okay, that sounds like a naughty weekend but I can top it.
So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on southern comfort right?
We know we gonna puke but Joe says Hey let's go see Chronicles of Riddick
Sat through the whole thing without puking and then I get home wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.
Ah, you know Jesus if I go get myself on, would you mind talking to my friend Mariel Goldman?
I really just want to rub her jewish nose in this.
All right, I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you really Jesus?
Say listen Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but there's one person I really want you to meet.
The American people may have turned against the war but I answer to a higher power.
Oh, that's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here.
I've heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work.
How you ever got to be president of anything is totally amazing.
Hey listen Jesus, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us.
You may look like a bum but you've got a lot of talent, young man.
Yeah, I've forgotten how great it is interacting with other people.
Well, I better get some sleep, I gotta open the store tomorrow.
Ah, you don't wanna get back to that record store. You gotta get back out there.
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.
I'm so ready to have sex with you. Oh, hey is that my phone?
You know you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?
Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.
Look at these idiots, they don't even listening. You know what, we gotta prove it to them.
Listen, I'm gonna go to that supermarket and get some water and you gonna turn it into wine.
Wow, Jesus, can you believe you gonna get to meet Jay Leno.
Mom, why is it there when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous and when I did, I've got suspended for 5 days.
You know, I owe this all to you Peter. You gave me the confidence I needed.
Ah, never mind about that pal. You just go out and knock 'em dead.
My face again to Dave Coulier. Season 3 of Full House is out on DVD March 5th.
My next guest died for our sins and now it looks like he's back on the scene.
So, Jesus, so what've you been doing since you've been back?
Oh, you know kinda bumming around, playing a little color duty for even a lot of pinkberry. blah-blah-blah
I raised River Phoenix from the dead then we went out to the Viper Room and he OD'd again. blah-blah-blah
Jesus Christ everybody. Will be right back with Joss Stone.
Did you see that? He made Jay Leno laugh. This guy is gonna be huge.
Now back to the MTV Movie Awards hosted by Dane Cook.
Hey everybody what's up? Dane Cook here in da house. At the MTV Movie Awards. what's up?, what's up?.
Hey you know what I hate? When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold.
And you like Why didn't you warn me that`s so cold?
And you like Oh, man. But chicks don't do that because they use a spoon.
I don't know but he's moving around a lot, so I guess.
And now to present the award for sickest on screen gangsta pimp bound  ? parisness
Boy. Who would've thought, me, Peter Griffin, the guy you just two weeks ago drew a smily face on his own testicle to make his son laugh.
Well, I've lost my train of  thought. But yeah, that's my buddy Jesus.
Hey, It's a pleasure to be here with you, six interchangeable women.
Last time I was down here on earth I only hung around with one whore.
Well, there's only one space left and I promised it to that cow.
This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!
Whoo, I'm in Hollywood! Gee, I've said I'll do it.
Peter, would you put that thing away, we're trying to eat dinner.
I can't believe Jesus hasn't called me back. I left him a message like 4 hours ago.
No, no, I rang twice and then a voice mail picked up.
If it gone straight to voice mail that means the phone was off.
If I rang like 6 times that means he didn't hear it but I rang twice Lois.
That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.
You know what, give me your phone, I bet he'll pick up.
Hey you. It's Peter. What the hell we were supposed to do something today.
Ah... Forgot to tell you, I have a doctor's appointment today, I'm actually there now.
Heeey, I just drink a beer, who wants to do me?
I do. Me too. I just did you, but I'll go again.
I'm sure deep down he's still that same old Jesus.
He may just need to figure that out in his own way.
None of this would've happen if somebody haven't stolen my fucking Surfin' Bird record!!!
Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconscious.
Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying: Jews are responsible for all the world's wars
Yeah, well, get someone else to bail you out, 'cause it ain't gonna be me.
Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.
I know Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.
You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go.
This world's not ready for me yet and I'm not ready for it.
I don't know. Maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm a little more mature.
Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there.
Well, before I go Peter, there's something I wanna give you.
Me too. Although he did give me something right before he disappeared.
Okay, everyone. Hurry up and hand in you oscar picks before it starts.
Ladies and gentlemen, Scarlett Johanson and for some reason Stewe Bushemi.
What the hell? I told you, we're staying for the governor's ball.
And I told you, Tim, we would see how the evening plays out.
I took a lots of any stool hardner (?), ooh.
I'd like to have before and after on this one.
I'll be out in a minute. I really need to go.
Sure Chris. Drink Ensure as a meal. Or inbetween meals.
Don't touch my stuff with you dirty walking on the streets paws.
I'm looking for Mort. He came up here an hour ago and never came back down.
Time machine? I didn't know you've had a time machine.
Yeah, built it after I got bored with that european see and say.
Stewie, do you think Mort might have accidently stumbled into the time machine?
Let's ask Rick Moranis and the backup singers from Little Shop of Horrors
Da-rum. I saw a red-headed guy come up here about an hour ago.
He seemed to be in a rush and had a pain look on his face.
And he stepped into that box there and suddenly there was a big flash of light.
Oh my god! Stewie we have to get him back. Where did the machine sent him?
How- How can you not know? It's a time machine.
Doesn't it have like display that tells the year or something?
Oh, I'm sorry Brian, is my time machine not as good as your time machine?
Oh, yeah, oh. You probably got a way better time machine. Yeah.
Well then-- Can't you just press a couple of buttons and bring him back?
No, he can't just come back. He needs the return pad.
All right. We'll go get him. But remember Brian, don't touch anything when we're in the past.
Even stepping on a mosquito could create a chain reaction that drastically alters the present.
Okay. If everything worked properly this should be the exact time and place that Mort was sent to.
Now we just got to figure out where we are.
Oh, that's such a douche time travellers thing to say.
Aha! Look Brian! This trail of used tissues should lead us right to Mort.
And so we had encrucified. But this doesn't leave this room.
Anyway, the point is, may Haim and Sarah have many wonderful years together. Amen.
He's a small business owner. Tends to wine a lot. Kinda of hypochondriac.
Oh no, you can't put you hand back up after you put it down. You know-- Never mind.
I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazl tov! Now step on the glass.
Oh, but be careful though. At my wedding I cut myself on the glass.
And when I've got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out.
Mort, this isn't heaven. You've time travelled into the past.
Just trust me, we're here to bring you back home.
There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo, and my great aunt Vera, who didn't like to spend a lot on anything.
But Brian, when am I gonna have another chance to see my grandpa Haim's wedding with my own eyes.
Yes, you know, he's right, Brian. Besides, I've never been to hebrew wedding.
Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top jew.
September 1st, 1939. This is the german invasion of Poland.
It's also the exact day and year that Rene Russo was born.
Quick, set up the return pad and let's get back to our own time.
Yeah. And you know what's not gonna fix it? Your shouting.
Yeah, right. How many pollocks does it take to fix the time machine? Let's find out.
No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe from the nazis.
Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful and rub dirt my assneck(?) all over my assy nipples.
All right, there's the checkpoint. If we can get past it, we're out of occupied Poland.
And we'll be bringing our friend, who's absolutely 100% not jewish.
We needed to conduct last right for our friend over there.
I mean a good guy, 'cause it says in the old book-- Not so old though.
You know still good, still good-- Uh, still something good thing to say--
We pray in the name of you and of your son, who died in a freak accident, that you can't really blame on anyone.
Sorry, I'm late. I was busy doing-- am-- innocent non-molested things.
Oh boy, you, you are, you, you, you should be glad, your HR person was not around here then.
All right, on three we make to the closest U-boat.
Ah, unsere untersee-boot sind stielen mit eine dog und baby und ardga(?) fonkel.
Oh my god! It's England. We've reached England. We're saved.
Maybe we'll get an upclose look at his legendary wit.
Hm, I guess history is just wittled it down to the gyms.
The transfer circuts are powered by uranium and this thing is taped out.
Wait a minute, are you saying we need to find some uranium?
I'm afraid so. But where do we find uranium in WW2 Europe?
There's only one place. At the top secret atomic research facility.
Wait a minute, germany is building weapons of mass destruction?
Why doesn't it matter then to go there and kick their asses?
I don't know. Maybe because they don't have any oil?
Mort, Berlin is the closest place we're gonna find uranium in this time.
Men, as officers of the royal airforce, you're the very best in the world.
However this mission to Germany will not be an easy one.
Four and a half of every five of you will not return.
Half of Jenson there, I can tell you, it gets pretty sticky(?).
So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home.
I have british accent, I'm possibly homosexual, I've never brushed my teeth and my wife is grossly(?).
You're my eyes, Gus. Keep an eye out for this crowds.
There are no parachutes, all I could find was this.
Dear god, this place is nightmarish. Look at the offencive way they draw a jewish people.
Oh, it's a doggy-dog rike(?) and I'm wearing a bacon pants.
It's coming, it's coming. There's some problems, we have much better luck developing this impressive collection of luftballons.
Well, I guess we'll just get you back to work.
Oh, I almost forgot, I can suppose you boys have some uranium I could borrow?
Oh, of course. Give him some uranium, Min Joe Green.
Let's find a safe spot and make the trip back home.
Zis fills are making a mockery of our Reich. Execute them.
[sings] Dammit, what are you do? Just get in the fucking time machine.
Don't you a little nervous that Mort knows all about this stuff?
You see, we've arrived thirty seconds before Mort came up to use the bathroom.
Only this time things are gonna play out a bit differently.
You guys are gonna love this spa. They give the best massages.
I tell you, I need this. I've had a really stressfull morning.
Wait a minute, Doc! Are you telling me that its 8:25?
Okay. Why don't you just get yourself settled up on that table.
Oh, ha-ha, you put some fake poo on the floor.
You listening to the Quiet Storm. Up next the music of the eyes list
Teddy Pendergrass and right now here is some Marvin Gaye
Focus on the lapels. That's where I carry most of my stress.
Okay, here's one. If you were gay and you had to have sex with either
That's so funny, I would also say John Forsythe, I was just curious.
Yeah, but you remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one and then rescues them at the end of the third one?
Yeah, why didn't they just fly the eagle to Mordor instead of spending three movies walking there.
That's not what it's about, Chris. It's about the quest.
Oh, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm just saying there's hole in the story.
All right guys, the best thing you can do for your body after a massage is hot coffee, alcohol and slim jims.
I've noticed one of my testicles went up inside my body and hasn't come back out yet.
Uh, Sir, this employee just made a sexual remark to me.
Ah, ah! Sir, sir! Your employee is exposing himself to me!
If you'd be willing to forget this whole thing happened,
Well, that and you're not the worst looking guy who's ever come in there.
Yeah, everyone except Brian 'cause he bought a Prius, what a dumbass.
What? What? What I miss? Are we laughing at Brian?
Oh, I threw out all your apple juice, Stewie. We're a gas family now.
Scream all you want, nobody can hear you out here.
Or... Or... I don't know man, but... but you're lucky you're not doing it over here... in the ocean.
Ah, if you don't like starfish you're gonna be mad about what I just did.
Ah, you're in for it now, buddy. I've got like five fish coming to help.
I figured, with unlimited free gas I can finally afford to go into space.
Why is it every time I open this door you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle you inexplicibly acquired?
I've got this at a NASA auction for next to nothing.
They were gonna scrap it cause of some minor mechanical problem or something.
I do not want you trying to fly that thing... you're not even a trained astronaut!
Plus I've had a lot of time to rub one out which in space is great, except after a while it's like living in a snow globe.
Peter, instead of wasting your free gas on a series of comedic stunts why don't use it more constructively?
Hey, maybe we can go to the island from Lost.
I know you're tired, Stewie, but you sleep all you want in the car.
Uh, 6 am. I shouldn't have stayed up all night listening to persian radio.
So, if you're cruising along the left side of the road at a 120 km per hour in zis kheavy desert, turn up the decibels
'cause it's Shaleb Mame with Zeheh Maleh on 103.2. The Hukh!
Oh, I was not aware that you can see the future, Lois.
Peter, you are not putting those birds in the car.
Oh, well then I guess we're not going on vacation.
Oh, hang on a second, I'm stuck behind some fatass driving too slow.
Hang on, Quagmire, some jerk behind me is honking his horn.
Oh, hang on a sec, some fatass just flipped me off!
This place is more deserted than James Gandolfini's workout room.
Lois, I'm about to drink my first soda, better come stop me.
Brian, do me a favor and check on Stewie, would you?
Hey, what do you say we sing a driving song?
Chris, I think you were a little early at start of bar 4.
I'm gonna take Brians novel and replace every use of the word and with the word fart. The young soldier fart his brother looked at each other fart both knew that with love fart truth fart courage they would both emerge st-fart-ing on their feet.
Well, I just thought we should stop and pay our respects.
No. Peter, Iraq had nothing to do with this, it was bunch of Saudi-Arabians, Lebanese and Egyptians financed by a Saudi-Arabian guy living in Afghanistan and sheltered by Pakistanis.
Wake up, Stewie, let's get you out of that seat and into a fresh diaper.
Oh my God, we must have left him at home!
God, I would give anything to see his face right now.
He's... He's probably all like Whe... Where the deuce is everyone?.
Oh my God, what kind of a mother am I?
Oh great, Lois. Now we gotta bail on the whole vacation. This sucks!
Now every time I come back to this place it's gonna be associated with one particular bad memory.
They'll probably even be willing to look after him 'till we got home.
Huh. Everybody's lying around in here. Liar, liar, pants on fire.
What am I in congress? Ho-ho. See, laughter is the best medicine.
Oh, next stop is Neverland. Come Wendy, fly with me. Ho-ho.
Of course how hard could it be? You just unfasten these things and lay back with your legs in the air and let nature do the rest.
Hm, it's still there. Usually the doodey's disappeared by now but it hasn't.
Oh well, the damage is done. Better get 'em out of here.

Am I the only one getting a boner right now?
Is there anything that doesn't give you a boner, Glenn?
People are used the word rubbish when they mean garbage.
Peter, it's been 8 hours and I haven't heared from Cleveland or Quagmire.
This is my wheelchair! There are many like it but this one is mine!
I'm sorry but we are not leaving Stewie by himself.
Professor, you've got to impregnate this elephant or the entire species will become extinct.
You mean I gotta put this thing in that thing?!
Well, this is the job that's not worth the money!
Lois, get off my back, will ya? I'm trying to watch TV.
I swear to God, sometimes I think your head's screwed on backwards...
Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers and just about everything else.
Which means I've got to get a job. otherwise we'll be in worse shape than Morbidly Obese Albert.
Huh, I can't eat those chocolates on account of my diabetes.
Look it on the bright side, now you get your shoes half-price!
Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice. You've got to go clean that up.
All right? There was no attempt to get near the toilet.
It's like they just... Pressed their buttocks against the wall.
The only part of the floor that didn't have poo on it
There was a guy inside selling shower curtain rings, so I bought a bunch of those.
These ones have helium in them, so they're very light.
Our baby is at home all by himself yet instead of getting us home you've managed to make things worse at every turn!
A monkey would be a refreshing step up from you!
If your instinct tells you to do something, don't do it.
If your instinct tells you not to do something, it's probably the right thing to do!
Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better.
You think what you want about me, I'm not changing.
Guys! I found us a ride to Quahog in the back of a truck! Hurry!
C'mon let's head home before Stewie gets hurt like Fozzie Bear when he went to Saudi Arabia.
Eh, It's good to worship Allah 'cause I used to worship Summer!
Eh, he was so arab that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all.
Stewie, can I see you in my office for a second?
She said she saw you in the back of the kitchen sneaking a fish sandwich.
Yes, okay. But the thing was five minutes past the throw out time.
Well, be that as it may. Shiwanda took these pictures on her cellphone.
I'm out of diapers and I'm down to Meg's last hat.
That my life was considerably better with my family around.
And I didn't realize it until it was too late.
I promise with all my heart that I'll never say or do anything bad to you for the rest of the evening.
By the way, I disabled the V-chip and I've watched so much porn.

Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville and I'm gonna take a shotgun blast to the face.
These guys are hilarious. They do so much funny stuff.
Hey. You know what. We should try some of that stuff. Here, at home.
I don't know Peter. That scull and crossbones warning before show us pretty clear about not doing that.
Cleveland, shut up. I saw something on TV that I want to imitate.
Peter, what are you-- What are you boys doing up there? Get off the roof!
I don't know. I don't know. What is it look like?
Wha-- What do I do? Aw. Ah, ah, what is that?
It's your spine, dude. It got like you ate down a bunch of nachos.
Well, I just covered my entire private area with honey.
Heh. Okay. Okay, they're on there. Just-- just nobody move.
All right, nobody-- nobody do nothing, don't wanna-- don't wanna make 'em mad.
All right, that's enough! That's enough. Just-- get them off.
Yeah, all right, enough is enough. Cleveland, open the hive.
I'm Peter Griffin and I am the Greatest American Hero.
My special power is being somehow memorable after a very short run on TV.
You know, Peter, I'd expect this kind of behaviour from you but you have no business endangering Brian like that.
I mean he jumped into that lake to try to save your life and he's 8 years old, Peter.
He's old, Peter. Plus he drinks and smokes all the time so take that 56 and make it 79 at least.
Why you making such a big deal out of this, Lois? I was just a little tired.
Yeah, well that's how it begins, Brian. Then the next thing you know
I'm making Peter dig a hole in the yard and you're in the pillowcase.
Ah, it's just what you said the other day, Lois.
He's not the dog he used to be and-- I'll have to get used to it.
Just like I've got to used to my acrylic nails.
No, I've got 4 people on hold but I can talk.
Well-- Look, Peter-- Don't worry, just let's forget about it.
Fantastic. And to help us forget about it family, I'd like to introduce-- New Brian.
Hey, gang! Whose leg do you have to hump to get a hug around here?
Well, now you getting old and New Brian's here to take some of the load off.
He's trained to fetch, roll over, and make you feel realy good about yourself.
Well, Meg and Chris, I can't decide which one of your hats I like better.
I-- I can't believe you've got a new dog. What about me?
Hey, you still my buddy. New Brian is just a new friend for the family.
Trust me, you guys are gonna get along better that Abraham Lincoln and his neighbour.
I hope you don't mind. I checked the time your alarm was set for and I shut it off.
I figured this might be a more gentle way to start off the day.
Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while, so I've got you a journal.
Actually, I got you two of them: my right ear and my left ear. Fire it away.
Dear diary. Today at the school library I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman with nipples that cover most of her breast too.
Sounds like the woman on that picture was pretty beautiful.
Oh, I think so. I'm gonna make you a little less gross every day.
Yep. In fact I wrote a new song today and I want to hear what you think of it.
Hey, Brian. I went out for a run this morning and I found this sitck.
And I've got you some of this. I don't smoke it myself but I sure won't judge you.
Well, you know, I wasn't sure about this new dog thing at first but I've gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy.
He's not just a delightful new friend for the family.
You no longer the cover girl. Look at Carol Alt.
Carol, come in here. They saying your name on the Family Man.
And besides, Brian, the evidence is all right in front of your nose.
But it probably couldn't hurt to remind them how much they value you as a family member.
Okay, everybody, tonight I've got a real treat for you.
Silvester Stallone in that porno, and Bill Cosby beating up that midget.
You know, poor little guy just sitten there eating a snack pack
Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere and just starts wailing on him.
No, no, these are home movies from when I was a puppy.
Argh, what the hell is the matter with you? Outside, outside, now!
Well, I hate to say I told you so but--
Wait a minute, I love saying I told you so.
So what if they have a new dog? Lots of families have two dogs.
Hey, Brian, I thought maybe we could spend an afternoon together?
And I thought we could go deep in the woods.
You know, like so far in noone can hear a gunfire.
He acted all crazy like Quagmire when he drunk dials me.
Yeah, I was just out with Joe. Wha-- what are-- what are you doing?
Aw, that's right, I just-- I just asked that. I forgot.
Hey, hey, this song made me think of you, so wa-- listen to this song.
Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of-- ran my course here and you know, besides there's whole big world out there and it's time I saw it.
I know but I thought about this long and hard and--
Well, I haven't decided that yet but I promise I'll be in touch.
Well, if your mind is made up about this, Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.
I hope this move won't be a boner for you.
I was just saying to Brian, I hope this move won't be a boner.
I-- I would agree. I hope he finds what he's looking for.
I'm in a bad mood and I'm gonna take it out on you.
My god, these are the best pancakes I've ever had.
You know, I appreciate you letting me stay with you but
I'm perfectly capable of going into the bathroom by myself.
Sorry, but there's leash in this neighbourhood and you never know who's watching.
Stewie. Do you know why W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk on his transatlantic crossings?
Now that I've got you, let's both revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
Well, I can't do this alone. Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.
I-- I don't know-- Am I blue or am I red?
Thanks for letting me stay, Glenn. I hope I'm not in the way.
I'm gonna be bringing a puerto-rican girl over here later and she's superhot and real nice but when she was five years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van and it's still kinda messed up in a pretty obvious instantly visible way and uh-- please don't say anything and-- try to make eye contact with her when she waddles in because I want this to work.
I mean she herself is so pretty but-- that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in 'em.
You know, when she's not looking you should take a look at it but but, good god, be discreet.
I mean he's-- he's so damn sweet and saccharine and perfect and he's turnin the family in to the bunch of douches.
No big deal, you've always told me I was a douche.
I tell you what, when this is all over, I'll make you some pie with a nice dollop of coolwhip.
There it is again, why you putting so much emphasys on the H?
Forget it, I'm going back as long as that new dog is there.
As long as he's a part of that family there's no place for me.
Can't say I blame you, I hate him as much as you do, Brian.
He's a bad fit. Like a crocodile at the alligator rally.
Yeah, lurking in the water with our eyes poken out.
Sneaking up on a crane or an egret and snapping our jaws on it.
And sometimes walking out on to a dry plane or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then.
Huh? What are you talking about? This is my home.
No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights, and we especially don't like the way you humped that chair in the den.
And now every time you sleeping with him, he's gonna be thinking of me.
And that is why I killed myself chopped myself up and put myself in the garbage.
Oh my god, suicide. How could we misjudge him so severly.
Well, the upside is at least we have our Old Brian back.
From now on, buddy, you're the only animal I care about.
We'll talk about it, when you want to talk about it.
Griffin, I need you to run this shipping report upstairs to the CEO.
Maybe if I walk down the hall with the wisecracking Rebe.
Yeah, I always wanted to sit inside of the executive bathroom.
Wow, Peter, since when do you get such dressed up for work?
Since I got tired of getting nowhere in this world, Lois.
I have decided to do whatever it takes to becoming executive.
Well, it would certainly be great if you got a promotion.
And I'm not giving up on my dream like I did with that indoor hot air balloon.
It's a probable twelve to seven that the guy's only doing it for some doll some doll! some doll! the guy's only doing it for some do-o-o-oll
Boy, it sure is great to have you back in town, Franck.
I don't know, that one guy seem to like it.
Sorry, I can't pay you more, guys, but business has been bad.
Oh, you can't sell this place. So few clubs play real music anymore.
Well, you wanna buy it? I'll give you a good deal.
If we play our cards right, this could be bigger than the Appolo Theater.
All right now, next up we get the comedy style, it's Kim Li Song, give it up.
So, you ever noticed when two black guys coming into your convinient store and one go one way and one go the other way?
You stay out of my store! All you stay out of my store! I remember your face!
Well, based on your track record you'll understand if I have trouble believing you.
Believe it, Angela, I hate being just a cargo around here.
Almost as much as I hate homeless people asking me for money.
It's a robot that I built to save this company money.
Now, before you say anything, one, it has no human emotions, and two, its prime directive is never to harm people.
You see that Anheuser Busch billborad next to the children's hospital?
Aw, oka, okay, yeah! Here we go! Now, everything worked out.
Franck and I just closed the deal to buy the Quahog Cabana club.
Oh, well, Brian, what else are you doing such terrible and stupid?
Just wait, in a few weeks that club will be the hottest spot in Quahog.
You're gonna fail faster than John Maddens wedding video business.
A lot of people says Stacy's no good and she slept with this guy and then that guy, and even this guy.
Well, tell you something, that experience's gonna work in her favor later in the game.
You know, what a hack of a wedding? Brad Farve.
Our management level position has become available and I've seen that you've been working very hard lately.
Holy crap! You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie and it said Obvious lesbian will bring great news
And also said A great piano will fall on me.
Hi, is this where I get the poop pass to use the executive bathroom?
Okay, well, make it fast, 'cause I'm starting to crown.
Mr. Griffin, all our executives require a high school education.
And your file says that you never passed the third grade.
If you want this promotion, you're going to have to go back and finish.
Well, that sounds hilarious but it also sounds like it might take a while.
Well, I mean, if that's what I got to do, then I guess I--
Next time you got a fortune cookie don't open it.
All you got to do is finish third grade and you'll get that promotion.
Grrr, this is gonna be the bigger pain in the ass than getting into Last Clap contest with Cleveland.
Hey, hey, hey! Clap one more time, you're not coming to my birthday.
Good morning, class. Starting today we have a new student.
I was actually in third grade a long time ago but I've never finished.
Except-- Except we had this funny little nickname for her.
We called her mrs. Killson. 'Cause she had an abortion.
I know, I know, it's kinda silly but we were-- You know, we were just a bunch of kids.
Omar is our top student and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory next week in the district Spelling Bee.
What are you doing in our class? You're old. Are you stupid or something?
Wow! I never knew you can make fun of someone for being homosexual.
And by laughing at other people's sexuality somehow I feel better of it at my own.
They'll be here, Franck. We just got to give them time.
I'll entertain him while we wait for more to arrive.
Play on the dark side like John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band.
Give it up, Brian, noone wants to go to a stupid big band club anymore.
You know, I could help you make some changes around here that would bring in customers.
You know, Brian, we should give Stewie a shot. It can't hurt.
Just trust me, Brian, I know exactly what to do.
Even more aggressive than Michael Jackson's treatment of his own groin on stage.
All right, Suzie. What have you brought in for Show and Tell?
This is my Malibu Barbie doll that I got for Christmas this year.
She comes with a hairbrush, a pocketbook and two different dresses.
Peter, I would like to remind you that you are in a classroom.
Hi there, my name's Glenn Griffin. Um, I'm here to pick up my son Peter for a ball ga--
Because you look a lot more like that child over there.
Hey, get a load of Meaner J. Cribbs(?) over here he's rubbing the records with his hand.
Stewie, what is all this? What did you do to the Cabana Club?
Ew, we don't call it the Cabana Club anymore, Franck. It's now called pLace.
Congratulations! You two now own the hottest spot in town.
Wow, that's a lot of people. I hope we have enough rhye(?).
I got a job as a field reporter for Channel 5 News.
Yes. And whoever collects the most is gonna win a free weekend here in the chateau with interhational food and wine tastings.
Well, we'll have to send someone to make sure that he is.
Wow, he effectively silenced Omar by hitting him in the face.
My dad hits me but I bet, if I hit others, the pain stops.
Someday I'll use what I've learned here on my wife.
Eh, hold on, let me take out my reading glasses.
So, you're joining him at next weeks districts Spelling Bee.
I you'll lead our school to victory, I'll let you pass third grade.
So, Brian, how is it feel to own the coolest club in Quahog?
I'd rather go bankrupt than cater to pretentious jerks like this.
We're making money now and besides this place ain't no bad.
Hey, you girls thirsty? Could I interest you in a couple of Rob Roys?
Uh, sorry, my-- my friend's a little new at the club scene.
Got, you're more out of place than Prince was on Price's right.
And what's your bid on the dining room said, Prince?
All right and the actual retail price of the dining room said is
Oh, Lois, I've just had a weirdest dream that Louis Black told jokes that was so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear.
Peter, you got to stay awake, the Spelling Bee's tomorrow.
But, Lois, I'm ascared, there's no way I can compete against other kids.
This like trained a Beach Shpoople champion Fiorg Wanderplug get a game a shpoople.
Don't be said, Paiter. That's why they call it shpoople.
He-hey, that's more like it. Where'd you get the threads?
We went to Barney's, I heared that's where all the famous people shop for skinny leg jeans.
These are the thightest penis-compressing and sperm-killing and testicles-grippinest jeans I ever tried on.
You look like rappers but you're not black so that's the perfect 'em out of danger.
I'm sorry but we've been over this before. We don't serve your kind here.
I would welcome the opportunity to hear from a lawyer that represents a gazelle.
He was the only guy on the golf course who had a five iron with the cork on the end of it.
So, who wants to come back to hotel and take a wack at my genitals?
Hang on, girls, I'll get you a couple of appletinies.
This is going great, Franck! This club and this closes
As soon as that guy shows up anyplace, it gets a worse rapped than John Wilkes Booth.
I like to bring transient hookers to the old oak-tree where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I watch them having sex with each other.
All right, Peter, if you spell your next word correctly, you'll win the competition.
The two lesbians are going shopping for double sided marade(?) leads.
Griffin, you blew up a children's hospital, you're going to jail.
Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty. and sentences you to seven days in prison.
God! I can't believe we bought this ridiculous clothes for a club that didn't even last.
Hey, come on, we had a great seventy-two hour run and in this business that's all you can ask for.
Besides, I've already opened a new club that's even more exclusive than this one.
Brian, it's so exclusive that it doesn't even have a location.
I think that's a beat we can all done, Stu.
Hey, Brian, what do you say, we sing Stewie some real music?
On the western side of Quahog if you care to come along there's a club that's so exclusive that a line is ten miles long
Where the douchebags come to party and to spend their fathers cash just to take home slutty women and then wake up with the rash yeah, they wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up with a rash
Take me out to pLace tonight where the ...(?) keep our tight and the guys in hooded sweatshirts have forgotten that they're white
Griffin, I need you to run this shipping report upstairs to the CEO.
Maybe if I walk down the hall with the wisecracking Rebe.

Guys, I don't think I can make it today. It looks like Bonny might go in to labor any minute so I think I should stick close to home.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't even say that with a straight face.
Man, I am so sick of this. Joe is just gonna keep bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonny's butt.
We are gonna figure out a way to induce labor and make Bonny have that baby.
Yeah! The sooner that kid comes out the sooner we get Joe back.
You remember when he bailed on us for that trip to spa we had to find another handicapped guy?
Never mind that, Bonny. I'm here to induce birth. Follow me.
Now I'm gonna put the TV-remote down by your feet.
And I'm gonna turn on Two and a half men
If your baby isn't totally braindead it'll come rushing out to change the channel.
And when he does I'll grab his hand and yank him out of there.
Two and a half men was filmed in front of a live ostrich.
Boy, this stinks. It's friday night and I don't have a date.
Well then, let me get you a number from my little black book.
We gotta get her to the hospital. Quick, Peter, get the car.
No way! I don't want pregnant mess in my backseat.
Oh, come on, you're the guy who soiled his pants while testdriving that sportscar.
Hey Peter, don't you wanna watch this? It's a beautiful miracle of nature.
I can't look. I didn't look when Lois gave birth and I can't look now.
Get out of there! GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WIFE YOU LITTLE BASTARD!!!
Oh, sorry. I was watching this Paula Poundstone comedy special.
Attention everyone. This is a twist tie, it comes with every loaf of bread.
When we are done selecting our piece of bread we use the tie to preserve...
What? Like you think you had a shot with her?
Ah, you're kidding. We'll go together better than Hannity and Colmes.
My problem with liberals, Allen, is that liberals hate America.
Here's the reality of the situation. I've got a hospital bill this morning.
Oh my God! Where are we gonna get that kind of money?
I don't know but we gotta figure that out soon.
I gotta tell you. That being able to pay my child hospital bills somehow makes me feel that...
I'm gonna show you what a man you really are.
The baby's hospital bill drain dollar savings so I've had no choice but to take this job
Scuse me, I couldn't help over there and you got yourself some money issues.
Well, I might be able to help you. How much you need?
Look, I'm a police officer, I can't afford to get mixed with a lawn shark.
And I don't have the credit for a bank loan.
Do it, Joe. Cause if you gonna work here any longer, you're gonna feel smaller than my eye floaters.
I can never look at it dead on, it always trying to get away.
Would you mind listen to this song I wrote for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think?
That was horrible. It was bad as Beethoven near the end.
Well, I'm still gonna do a little work on it.
What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.
Don't worry, Joe. We're all gonna pitch in and help you raise that money.
Wow Peter, I got to say this lemonade stand was really a good idea. It's selling really well.
We should just... We should just get on our bikes and just go.
You know... I've never to... I've never told anyone this. but you're so good at cursive.
I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.
May I interest you in a full release relaxation massage?
Oh yeah! Just what I need. To be rubbed down by big fatty an old black guy, a crippled and a pervert.
Now we don't have any money and our feelings are hurt.
In about an hour I'm gonna piss away 20 grand.
Look at that, she can fit that full bottle in her mouth.
Allright, come on Stewie, you can write a song. How hard could it be.
It's like a cozy house where you live that's where you start your journey here I am in my house, nice and cozy and then you poke your head out the door with the seacode(?) everything looks ok out here maybe I'll take a walk outside to the decored oh, walking around outside look at all that stuff out here and then we go to an ...(?) getting a little cloudy out here looking like we might have some weather then we go to ...(?) oh, definetly goes some weather things a little more complicated than they seen at first and then we go back to my house
You sound like an unbelieveable douche. then Brian comes in and I change up the tempo
Brian comes in and it changes the song looking at me like he thinks I'm a douchebag but he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong hey Brian, why are you bringing me down there? why are you bringing me down? DON'T BRING ME DOWN!
Hey Swanson, the boss is getting impatient. He wants his money.
He says after we've done with you, you gonna be eaten...
Wha-What did the boss said? He said something funny and now I drowe the blank, wha-wha-what it was?
Eh, you know what is was? You know what it was?
When we're done with him he's gonna be a Swanson TV-dinner.
Look what they did to me. My legs are useless now.
You know what, boys? Desperate times call for desperate measures.
If that stingy old cat won't give us the money we need
That's the guy whose chin... looks like a b... balls.
All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.
But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt annual Bring all your cash and put it in our safe party.
Considering the guest list there could be as much as 40 million.
My father-in-law has treated me like crap for almost 20 years and it's time for a little payback.
I tell you, he's treated me worse than that jerk Cristian Bale did.
I dropped the pean(?) on Eminem and rolled over here.
I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights stand in a middle of a scene.
Those are the Christmas lights, I put them up to make everyone happy.
Ah, ta-da-ta-da, like this in the back room. What the fuck it is with you?
Well, you are gonna owe a fortune to a swearjack(?).
I don't get why we need another terminator. I just... I don't get it.
And by the way, sorry, I ate that last piece of pie you were saving for yourself.
I hope it was fucking good because it's useless now, isn't it?
Wa... It's nourishing me, so it's useful. ... sake man, you're amateur.
I'm gonna go pee and I wanna walk around some more and I walla scenes going (?).
You don't fucking understand what it's like working with actors. That's what that is.
My family is coming to town, do you mind pretending that I'm the director.
Go away! I'm editing this music video, I'm making for Susie.
Little compilation of visual images to go with the song?
There. All done. All right, Brian, get ready to feel.
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
Oh - you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it - there's nothin' I want more
I would fight for you - I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you - yeah I'd die for you
Don't worry, Brian, those goose bumps will go away in about 20 minutes.
Bill, how are you? Barb, come over here and say hi to Bill Gates.
Hi, mrs. Pewterschmidt. Well, this is a great little party you guys are throwing.
Oh, wait, I have an iPod like the rest of the world.
Hey fellas, knock off all that high society crap and play some of this.
'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
All right, Cleveland, you're all clear to enter the vault.
Yeah, he and the guys went to rob your dad.
Oh, I didn't match the shape, I just stuck in and broke it.
What is the most unattractive male first name in the English language?
All right boys, pack up the do(?) and get out of there.
I'm here to try to talk some sense into you.
I don't know where else to get 20 thousand dollars.
But you know, dad will find out he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.
You'll miss running after her as she learns to walk...
I... I mean... I mean riding bikes with her as she...
Look, my point is you know that you doing this wrong and you know how to make it right.
Uh... Guys... Put the money back and get out of there.
Peter, I want you to promise me, you'll never do anything that stupid again.
Lois, after what you did for Joe, I promise you everything.
How the hell did you get your dad to give that 20 grand?
Now remember, Peter, don't touch these money until you get to the grocery store.
Then buy one can of beans and come straight home.
Lois, I'm the guy you can trust with the task.
You left for the market six hours ago. Did you get the beans?
You know how you always wanted a real diamond engagement ring?
Why the h... I didn't even give you that much money.
This horse is brain-damaged, that's why I got it so cheap.
Peter, I don't think it's wise to have a brain-damaged horse as a house pet.
You'll see, this horse will be a fine addition to our family.
You know what, I don't want him to feel selfconcious. Everybody pee.
It's so creepy the way it just stares like that.
Peter, take Maple Drive, otherwise we won't make the movie on time.
Cmon you! We're go... We're going to see a movie.
Oh, that's got all my stink of the day in it.
Peter, why are there so many bottles of milk in the refrigerator?
Everyone, some of the milk in the fridge is not milk it's horse sperm.
Peter, no one's gonna want to breed with that horse.
I'm gonna enter him into the Quahog derby and he's gonna win.
I just know it. I got a sixth sense about these things.
Remember when I predicted the ending to the wild hogs?
We are gonna get a great view of the track from up here.
Even though he's got a race, he couldn't hold it.
God, it even runs like it messed up in the head.
Is there reason all the horses are named after canceled Fox shows?
Kitchen Confidential is in the lead followed by The Wedding Bells followed by The Happy Hour followed by The War at Home followed by Drive followed by The Winner followed by Life on a Stick followed by The Loop followed by Head Cases followed by Standoff followed by Vanished followed by Free Ride followed by Method & Red followed by Tru Calling followed by Quintuplets followed by Stacked followed by Justice followed by North Shore followed by Back to You
And bringing up the rear but somehow still in the race is 'Til Death.
'Cause I'm gonna take this horse and shove it down America's throat.
It looks like 'Till Death has taken a right turn and is heading into the stand.
Dear god! I could describe the horror I'm witnessing but it is so unfathomable ugly and heartrending that I cannot bring myself to do so.
Oh... Well at least the horse ran past the class of visiting deaf secondgraders.
I know you can't hear any screams but I assure you they're signing frantically just as fast as their little fingers can shape the complicated phonemes necessary to convey dread and terror.
Look, can we not talk about the horse, please? It's gone.
It suffered a fatal heart attack from the exitement when I disposed of it properly.
Oh boy. I miss the old days when it was just a flaming bag of poop and a hurtful note.
I have no idea how the hell we're gonna pay for this, Peter.
Well, I just have to get a second job or something.
This is perfect. Now I want to take off that job as Matt Damon's neck.
Hey, is this another one of those movies where you're an educated Boston street tough?
I don't have to take that crap from you, neck.
Ben Affleck married Jennifer Gardner but you're married a bartender with a kid.
We're isolating and studying the effects of various types of genes.
We're just going to give you a series of experimental injections and record the results.
It will give you the appearance of being funny even though you haven't done anything funny.
I gotta get some beers with the fellas before I go on this date.
All right, mr. Griffin, at this time we're going to inject you with what we believe we've isolatet as... the Gay gene.
Well, if we're correct, we'll have successfuly proven that homosexuality is genetic.
I'm gonna squeeze right in here if my size will let me.
Ah, all sorts of things hepatitis vaccine, a couple of steroids the gay gene, calcium, a vitamine b extract.
I assume that's the one you meant even though it wasn't literally the last thing I've said when you said What did you just say?
Did anybody see that absolutely fabulous piece on Fiji in yesterday's travel section?
Peter, I think maybe you should go back and have that doctor undo whatever he did.
Dad, I think mom's right. Maybe you should go back to that doctor.
I mean, I'm not holding your face with my heterosexuality.
One trick I used to use is turn the things into a word problem.
If there are three glory holes in the bathroom at the club and
How many rotations of guys will it take before everybody's had a turn?
Guys, Brent can't fit in the glory hole, and that's why we all like Brent.
That black guy must be doing well because everything he owns is white.
Well, here's the new nighty you've picked up for me.
I think I'm jelous of miss Eats anything she wants and still fits into size 4 Oh, I could scratch your eyes out. Meow.
You know, Peter, with all the shopping and cooking and decorating. I have to say
Just tell me, doctor, is there anything you can do to remove this gene?
We just have to wait for the effects to wear off.
For all we know, he could be this way for the rest of his life.
I don't see what's the big deal is. I like myself this way.
Just like my uncle Ray with the really high up anus.
So we're all just gonna have to get used to this and lend to accept your father for who he is now.
Oh, great plan, Lois. Hey, here's a merry idea ever read The Bible? Leviticus 18:22.
Stewie, you judgementaly quoting Bible versus and you don't even know how to read.
My solemate, Lois. I'm here, I'm queer, but don't get used to it 'cause I'm leaving you.
I'm sorry, Lois. I can't deny who I am any longer.
Take the lessons I've thought you and be the best leader of this household you can.
Gay or not, I just wish he was still here.
I miss dad too, mom. But we'll manage it somehow.
You just make me want to be a gayer man.
Ah, sure I do, but this is a whole new chapter of my life, Scott.
Oh, Peter, let's snuggle on the couch and watch Lifetime.
It was awful, he made me do things awful things.
So, you sure you don't need any house repairs, mrs. Griffin?
No, thanks, Rick. Ever since Peter left our house hasn't been getting destroyed by a shenenigans on a weekly basis.
God, I feel so bad for Lois. She really misses Peter.
Oh yeah. I just... I just had it lying around.
Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet And willingly I
This is Straight Camp, Peter. I'm sorry but I'm doing it for Lois.
By the time you get out of here you're gonna be back to your old self again.
You're all here because you've made a choice to renounce your evil sinful ways and redeem yourself in the eyes of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ who hates many people but none more than homosexuals.
All right. Look. Just put them down and use your fists.
All right. This next exercise will train you to talk like a straight man.
Peter, we'll start with you. Repeat every word I say exactly as I say it.
Tonight me and my friends Poly and Matty are going out to drink a ton of beers.
Then we'll play full contact football in the park with no pads or helmets.
Then we're gathering at Allen and Omars for bad movie night
Then its straight to the bars to find loose women to have sex with.
Then its straight to the gym for three hours of crunches and extended eye contact with strangers.
That's exactly what you said. I said it right back to you.
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry about you, people but I didn't know where else to go.
I haven't seen Peter in two days and I just thought he might be here.
Hey, hang on, hang on, hang on before anyone gets too worked up.
Well, its just... You seem so unhappy and I just... wanted to help you get your husband back.
Who knows, by now Peter could be completely heterosexual again.
I'm here to get you out of this place, Peter.
Peter, there's nothing I'd want more than have you back but your place is in Scott now.
I mean a person sexual identity is no more a choice than the color of his skin.
Ah, Lois, you've made me happier than a pig among guinea pigs.
All right, I think we all on agreement. I'm in charge here.
Guess what? I have a welcome home surprise for you.
Oh my god, yes I do. And you so did not even.
Huh. It wears off after two and a half weeks.
Oh god, I feel like I'm kid in the candy store who's having sex with a bunch of gay guys.
So, we're just like never gonna talk about this again?
Well, I'm just happy to have your father home again.
Tonight's episode of Family Guy was recently discovered in Peter Griffin's basement, along with a number of other lost episodes.
The following events take place in Quahog in March of 2007.
I thought if I shock him enough it'd stop crying.
Ah... C'mon, we're all just trying to have a good time.
OK. I dare you to make out with Joe for 15 seconds.
Oh my god! They gonna do it! Oh, I gotta take a picture.
Duh, he's a worse dad than a rich New York City investment banker.
Get out the room, how dare you to bother your father.
Now come on, I'll let you rub some lotion on me elbows.
Call the fire brigade! Get a ladder! Get me down!
What do you think I'm doing up here, I'm stuck!
What am I doing an interview? Shut up and get a ladder or something!
So, Stewie, tell us about that new project you have coming up.
What are you talking about? Get me down, you douche.
Uh... I've been working on a new movie and it's really great. Toss me a rope!
I mean he's doing his thing and you got to...
'cause, you know, that's the game you just not gonna win.
What was it like having a privilege of performing the words of Oscar winnier Diablo Cody?
I... envy the tattoo artist who had that huge canvas of arm fat to work with.
Wonderful. Wonderful. Hey, listen, could you hang with us through the break?
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, hang on, Michael.
Peter! What is our infant son doing up on the roof?
Twitty Conway - I See The Want In Your Eyes
So, Lois, you still pissed at me about Stewie being on the roof?
Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?
Get out of here. Just get the hell out of here.
Look, Lois, what do you say we just bury the hatchet, huh?
We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn and watch Jimmy Camel try.
It's all right, it's all right. I'll fix the dish.
I won this in 1989 from a Honey Nut Cheerios sweepstakes and I totally forgot to cash it in.
Had a bit part in Roots. Couple of great scenes in The Towering Inferno.
Chuck Connors? He was the basketball player and he was in Roots.
Yeah, he wasn't in The Towering Inferno, you dumb beaver.
Now, that's the story I can sink my teeth into.
Peter, why in the world would you want to play golf with O.J. Simpson?
Why not, Lois. He's The Juice, one of greatest football players ever.
He brutally killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
Wait a minute, if he killed two people, how come he's not in jail?
Well, Peter, it's generally believed that the jury made a mistake.
You're saying all those guys in their powdered wigs and pilgrim hats and their big gross wives were wrong?
Man, they have to be stupider than you are when you fart yourself a wake.
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.
What? Peter, you can't play golf with O.J. Simpson. He's a murderer.
Oh, you sound just like Lois. No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.
Oh yeah? Well say that after the soul-searching walk around the town to Dust in the Wind.
What am I gonna do, I'm playing golf with him tomorrow.
Get O.J. to confess and we could tape the whole thing.
Wow, imagine it. Peter Griffin - the guy who took down O.J.
Did you know that beavers affect ... more than any other animal?
Now remember, Peter, we will be right here in the van if anything goes wrong.
Do you think he'd be offended if I ask him to sign this basket ball?
Damn it. Would you look at these golf shoes, they're all scuffed up.
My wife were supposed to polish 'em but clearly she forgot.
Man, sometimes I just feel like I could just stab her repeatedly.
I got this jewish waiter one time. He was awful, didn't tip him.
You eh... You've doing something bad to a jewish waiter?
What's up, Peter? I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.
You're doing great, Peter. Just don't let him intimidate you.
Hey, you know what I like to do sometimes, Juice?
I like to just confess things I've done to people.
You know, just clean my ... Makes me feel a whole lot better.
Peter, we're not really hearing him very well. Can you get closer?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to confess to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?
Peter, I'm hurt. How could you decieve me like this?
Wait a minute, is this about that whole business back in 1994?
And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf away from all those people who have demonized me and made me out some kind of bogeyman.
Even though I was found innocent by jury of my PS.
The one thing I'm guilty of is a few bad movies.
And that makes up for the other murder. I am sold.
Not without sad eyes, I'm gonna make sure everything is gonna be all right.
Ten thousand rushing yards, six pro-balls two arrests and no convictions. All it's O.J. Simpson.
Peter, are you out of your mind bringing O.J. Simpson in our home?
Yes, he have a few marital problems but I used to look up to him.
That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson as a boy and you just can't accept the fact that he's not who you thought he was.
Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.
Um... Sure, you can take the lasagne out of the oven.
Uh, it's all right, O.J. Le-let me get something to clean that up.
It's not the first accident we've had in this house.
OK, one... two... Oh-oh, hang on, hang on, Brian. Stop the wheel, stop the wheel.
Hey, Juice! Is it all right if I call you Juice? Great!
Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise on how to murder a woman and get away with it.
Well, I've got no money left to pay my off civil suit debt.
So I'm making a god's eye to send to Fred Goldman.
He's got money to buy tongue depressors and yarn but not enough to pay us back?
You know how much mustache creme I could have bought?
Quahog, Rhode Island known for quaint neighborhoods white sandy beaches and harboring bloodthirsty murderers?
That's right, Tom. Former murderer O.J. Simpson has moved to Quahog.
We don't have footage of the murder itself but we can show you what's happened thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.
I love you, Nicole but I must confess to some trepidation for I am a lonely waiter who loves a loss of a estation (?) opera-style song
Well, it looks like this is one more town the medias run me out of.
Now wait a second, Juice. You can't let them tell you how to live your life.
I say you let people get to know you the way I have.
Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.
Peter, I really appreciate this but... are you sure people are ready?
This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.
Sure I do. Look, here comes a bunch of people.
Uh, Peter, that's not a group of enthusiastic party guests
Anyone who wants a piece of O.J. has to get by me.
No, Peter. This is my fight and I'll be the one to fight it.
Why you no better than what you made me ought to be.
I've taped football games without the expressed written consent of the NFL.
The only difference is I have the courage to admit it.
If so, why don't you just come on up here and join me?
Well, see, I got drunk and then got my picture taken.
So that way, when I get pulled over for drunk driving I'll look the same as on my license.
Y'know, and then the copper, copper'll say Oh, you're fine, you're not drunk.
This is you normal,  I can tell by the picture.
Oh, I'd just gotten a new tube of Aquafresh and I was feeling cocky.
Uh...carrots. Sometimes I grind 'em up into juice, or just eat 'em raw.
Or insert them anally. Long as I get 'em into my body somehow.
And now back to the FOX News Report with Rhonda Latimer.
Oh, God. That new FOX news reporter is so freakin' hot.
Good evening. I'm Rhonda Latimer for FOX News. Here are tonight's top stories.
God, I would do things to her that. she would probably laugh at.
Turn to the FOX News. It's time for Rhonda Latimer.
And we also want to remind you that FOX News switches to high definition starting Monday.
Ah, crap! Does this mean gotta get a new TV?
I'm tellin' you this thing has turned out to be nothing but a burden.
Oh, a few of the fellows at work talked me into it.
The worst thing is, I found out I got it on the gay side.
I'm not gay. They put the hole in the wrong side.
Look at me. I'm an Iraq war vet in 10 years.
Yeah, it's so clear you can even see Ellen DeGeneris' breath.
How's it feel to have the hottest film in Hollywood?
And now the real reason to have an HD TV.
And now the FOX News 6 o'clock report with Rhonda Latimer.
Good evening everyone and I hope you're as thrilled about the new format change as I am.
I'll get all of the A's out of my body.
We interrupt this report to inform you Rhonda Latimer has been relocated to Guantanamo Bay.
Mom, do you ever feel.... not so fresh down there?
I've never had that problem and I don't know any woman who has.
Hey, look at this. FOX News is looking for a replacement for Rhonda Latimer.
I mean, you majored in journalism and you've never done anything with it.
Yeah, didn't you do an interview with that fast talking FedEx guy?
Thats a beautiful shade of lipstick. I bet you enjoy the music of Men at Work.
You're incredibly foxy. Take off your shirt. Take off your pants.
Wow, what a body, that feels good, I'll give you a call. You'd better get tested.
Well, I mean I guess there's no harm in trying out.
Hey, Lois. A little less yackity-yak, little more cuttin' up my banana.
What am I supposed to do? Stick the whole thing in my mouth?
Lois, you can't possibly be considering working for FOX News.
Why not? Because they're evil and they distort the truth.
Don't listen to Brian, Lois. You'd be great on camera.
Like I was, when I played that dead body on Law and Order.
The contusion on his left temple implies he was hit by a blunt object.
And even though this Iraqi veteran lost his hands he didn't lose his ability to feel.
Y'know, I've been doing this job a long time, and I think  you've got what it takes.
Yes. How would you like to be our newest on-air reporter?
W-w-well ... y'know I came down here not even thinking I had a shot and now you're telling me this?
Now run home Lois. Run as fast as you can.
Lois, I can't believe you're doing this. If you work for FOX News you're  going to be selling your soul.
Are you kidding? They're a lie factory. They report whatever they damn well please.
Y'know Brian, you're welcome to come with me to see for yourself that it's all on the level.
Y'now, I just might take you up on that, Lois.
And I know another way we can take advantage of this.
Chris ... Meg. Meet me in the living room in 10 minutes and bring a pencil and paper.
Meg, now that Lois has connections at FOX, we are gonna invent our own cartoon show.
Ooh ... how about a show about a bunch of disabled ducks and we'll call it Handi-Quacks.
Wow, caught fire a little earlier than I thought we would, Perfect!
Alright, let's spend many hours on this. Alright, the main duck ... what's his name?
Ha-ha-ha, I love it. I love it. Alright, now what's his wacky neighbour duck's name?
Meg, please try to formulate ideas clearly before you vocalize them.
Chris, can I talk to you in the kitchen for a sec?
Alright, then I think we're going to have to expect nothing, right, and then
Welcome to FOX News, Lois. We're very excited to have you.
Oh, this is my dog, Brian. He was just dying to see the studio.
I'll have you know my grandparents died in the holocaust.
I'll show you to our day care facilities shortly, but first let's have a look around.
This is our control room, where we have the ability to monitor up to 500 different news stories in any given hour.
It emits a noise that only Al Gore can hear.
And this is the kitchen. We've got all kinds of snacks and cold drinks in here.
Alright, here we go. Handy Quacks. Episode 1, scene 1.
Let's get 'em laughing right off the bat. Interior, Red Hynie Monkey's house.
Ah, I don't think people eat breakfast anymore. More suggestions.
Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose are trying to build a house of cards and it keeps falling down?
Now. Alright. Let's take a walk down this road and see where it leads us.
Umm ... maybe Poopy Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh .. Boy, this house of cards just doesn't wanna stay up.
Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna go right at it like a neanderthal sure, but I think we're shooting for a little more subtilty here, y'know.
Y'know, I don't believe that. I don't believe that that's a real conversation when I hear it. People don't talk like that, Meg.
Oooh ...oooh! What if they just bought a new wood stove and Red Hynie Monkey says, Boy, it's so hot in here because we just bought that new wood stove
(Both) and we're sweating, and our hands are all slippery and that's why we can't get the card house to stay up.
Thank you, Chris. We have lift off! Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry but none of this stuff seems to make sense.
I mean, we haven't even referenced the fact that they're ducks or that they're handicapped. But the show is called Handi-Quacks.
This is not working out. This is not workin' ..
Yeah, in the real world she doesn't know about it.
Alright, Lois, for your first assignment we want you to do an investigative expose on one of America's greatest enemies.
Oh, here we go. This is exactly what I was talking about, Lois.
FOX News will take down anyone who doesn't agree with them.
Wha...? Now wait a minute, Brian. Give him a chance.
We have reason to suspect that Michael Moore may be a closet homosexual. We need you to get the proof.
Well, if you think that Michael Moore's possible homosexuality is news worthy, I'll do my best to get the story.
Alright, I have come up with a design for Red Hynie Monkey the head of the Handi-Quacks.
People will tune in to Handi-Quacks each week and see that big red bum and get a big laugh out of it.
Good note. Good note. OK, now I also had a thought for a female character who's always nagging at Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not to leave his beer cans lying around and what-not.
You can see I gave him a funny little suitcase.
Now, see the joke is, most people only carry a suitcase when they're going on vacation.
But Poopy Faced Tomato Nose carries one all the time.
And see, he's got a sleeve hangin' out. He didn't pack it right.
Chris, can I see you in the kitchen for a sec?
Your writing partner is out of her mind.  OK first of all stop calling her my parsha.
Dad, if you want to fire her, you go ahead and fire her.
But don't pretend that you're doing it for her benefit.
And her lack of talent and her lack of funniness...
I just, y'know I just feel that you and I have captured lightning in a bottle with the Handi-Quacks.
I don't understand. The lights are on. Somebody must be home.
What's he doing coming out of Michael Moore's house at this hour?
That's not dog poop. Sorry, we've been out here a long time.
And look, there's Rush Limbaugh coming out of Michael Moore's house at 2 in the morning.
I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it myself.
Well, your dog was right, Lois. Looks like there's no story here.
What are you talking about? You're the one who sent me to investigate, and now I'm showing you proof and you're dismissing it?
Lois, I'll be honest. Rush Limbaugh is one of us.
That would be as foolish as F.D.R hiring that midget press secretary.
The President has just confirmed a devastating surprise attack by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
Much of our naval fleet has been destroyed and the death toll is believed to be in the thousands.
OK, actors. Welcome to the first voice record for Handi-Quacks.
I know, Red Hynie Monkey. This card house won't stay up.
It's all comin' together. This is it. Our vision. Come to life.
And then picture him holding that suitcase with the sleeve sticking out.
I just built a space ship. Wanna come up in space with me in it?
I just figured I'd give Colonel Tush Finger an Australian thing.
You understand? I. am. Colonel. Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon so. I. talk. like. this. with. a. moon. accent. Do that!
So they want me to drop the story completely because they don't want to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
Now do you see what I was saying about FOX News?
Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They wanted you to do the story when they thought it would embarrass Michael Moore, but they don't want you to do it if it's going to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
But you didn't want me to do the story when it was gonna embarrass Michael Moore.
But you want me to do the story if it's gonna embarrass Rush Limbaugh?
Can you picture the 2 of those guys pokin' each other in the chops?
Eeuugh! It'd be like sticking your arm in a backed up sink.
OK. You're right. I'm a little biased myself but at least I'm willing to admit it.
An oversized Armani suit and an oversized cheap wind breaker tossed casually on the floor.
Look, they started this, Lois. But it's up to you to finish it.
Next day at work, Limbaugh finds a Detroit Tigers ball cap up in there.
Like the way Commissioner Gordon tells Batman that he just took a poop.
You realise that the only reason I'm taking this meeting is that your wife is a reporter for our news division?
We fire the jokes at you like an automatic weapon of comedy.
We throw a curve ball joke at you, hit you right in the head
We take you on a little trolley ride down story lane. You're havin' a good time, enjoying out little tale, think you know what's coming. BOOM!
Left turn! You don't know how it happened. You don't know where you are, but you like it.
You're yukking it up, you're laughing, your sides are hurting. All of a sudden you realise, you're feeling something too.
When did they become like welcome guests in your home whose weekly visits the whole family eagerly awaits?
# One day 3 ducks were crossing the road #
# But they weren't looking where they were going #
# And a bus came along and hit them all #
Our palms are slippery and sweaty because of the heat from that new wood stove we just bought.
Easy. I just walked into the wood stove store and said Put it on my bill.
It's a small change. And if you do it, we'll really get behind this show.
Well, if you're gonna be a TV producer, you've gotta be open to collaboration.
So everybody just gets to stick their big chef's spoon  into my comedy gumbo, eh?
OK, we'll do the show, and we'll do it your way.
Mr Moore. Mr Limbaugh. Do you have anything to say to FOX News about this ...
And what have you done with your gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?
Wait a minute! You mean all these years Rush Limbaugh has just been Michael Moore in disguise?
Well, after the Wonder Years I was hungry to do more acting but the pickings were slim so I came up with this scheme to satisfy my need to perform and I guess it got a little out of hand.
Wow! Fred Savage is the greatest actor in the history of the world.
Well if you let us run this story, I promise you they will.
This Sunday on FOX, it's the new hit comedy starring America's greatest actor, Fred Savage.
Well, Lois, you did a good thing for a talented guy.
I don't think I was cut out to be a TV reporter.
The story's over. Everything will be back to normal next week.
Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight
Especially since he got kicked out of the last one.
Uh, in that episode where you drown your wife, why are you so fat?
Brian, look. I've purchased authentic blue prints to build a Star Trek transporter.
That's great Stewie. You should get William Shatner to sign 'em for you.
He's poised and measured and doesn't wear a chear lug.
Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says: I am in command. You are safe with me.
I will cradle you in my arms though any crisis in any galaxy.
Why would he wear these? Who would invent these for him?
And in conclusion, whether your dreams are earthbound or set in the stars - follow your heart.
Ooooh, oh boy. He always says the things he says on TV
Now the cast and I would be happy to answer a few questions.
Um, often times my household's sponges accumulate an awful amount of buildup.
It's very important to thoroughly wring out your sponges after every usage.
I have this itch on the back of my leg. And I can't figure out if it's a bug bite or dry skin?
I've got an artesian well on my property and the water pressure is lousy.
But remember that the summer months take a particular toll on any region's aquafer, depending on the local climate.
You bastards. I'll get my question answered one way or another.
Meg, Meg! Come take your picture with this space alien guy!
Thank you so much buddy. Hey, how did you make that awesome mask?
What? You came to a Star Trek convention with the mumps, you could be infecting people with a disease!
Yeah, like that old gipsy did to Britney Spears in that Stephen King book.
Well, it was 1992 and I couldn't be bothered with anything that didn't involved Dan Cortese
Besides, what's a big deal? I never got a mumps shot.
Well, I caution you, that getting the mumps as an adult could result a serious complications.
In some cases the symptoms could spread to the testicular glands.
Are you kidding? I always thought those were two little sandbags to keep floodwaters from floating into my bum
No, no. I'm just poking at your funny bone. I am quite alarmed.
Like the people who think it's OK to bring shampoo on an airplane.
I work hard, I like a clean house when I come home.
See, Chris, come here, come here, look. Check it out.
Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but your father's bringing in the old TV.  Hey Meg!
Here's your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote and it only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.
Hi, welcome to the Religion channel number one show. Kirk and the Lord just hanging. With me, Kirk Cameron.
Today, I'm gonna tell you why God will always be there for you.
Are you unloved? Do you feel like no one cares about you?
If my calculations are correct the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation will soon be here to anwser all my questions!
Wow, look who's finally out of her room after five days.
This is the day that the Lord hath made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
That's right folks. It's gonna be a Meg episode. Stick around for the fun.
Kirk Cameron explained it all to me. The Lord is my saviour.
It's that damn religion channel. She was watching it all day while she was bedridden.
I want to share the word of God with everyone I know. Starting with my family.
Now, everyone hold hands because we are gonna say grace before we eat.
Dear Lod, please give me the cheat codes from Mike Tyson's Punch-Out
I have been stuck on Bold Ball for four years.
And you know, they say your supposed to go Right-B-Up-dodge-Left-uppercu...
Listen to me, telling you how to play a game.
The cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation is here to anwser my questions!
I'm a huge fan. And you are going to answer all my questions.
That was a warning. Please, do not speak unless you are spoken to.
Although I will say it was an awful lot of fun.
Oh fuck you Michael! Fifteen years later you still got that attitude.
You know, I think you should all be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
I said you ought to be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
What? I'm just saying, you should be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton. Hwil Hwheaton seems like a nice guy.
Hey, did you hook up with Whoopi Goldberg on the show?
And I think it's important for all of you to hear his inspiring message about the word of God.
You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have faith in but there is such a thing as moderation.
Are you willing to open yourself up to God's truth?
Oh, you're barking up the wrong tree, Meg, I'm an atheist.
Why? I just thought you knew. I mean, I never go to church.
Brian, it's one thing to bash organized religion, but we believe in God in this house,
I mean an atheist... that's just about the worst thing a person can be!
I have dominion over you and I command you to believe in God!
But not one picture of a guy with a beard sitting around on a cloud.
You know, you keep talking like that, God's gonna get you, Brian.
Stewie, I'm not really much of a fast food eater.
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now? I'm thinking Shut up and get a salad
Oh yeah, we're gonna get two McChicken sandwiches and a diet coke and..
No, I already told you they don't make those anymore!
I'd love a shamrock shake if they got any of those.
No LeVar, you're blind, that's the only way you can see.
Just saying they have all the ingredients for a McB.L.T.
Just hang on, alright? There's a lot of us, it, there's a lot of.. It's a big order!
Hey Brian! In hope you'll open your heart to God
Would you want it if I threw it over there?
Brian, Kirk Cameron is the one who converted me but unfortunately he's not available.
They got my picture up at the drug store and they won't sell me any Sudafed.
What have I told you about trading sexual favors for sudafed?
Look, Meg. I've had enough of this. You not gonna convert me.
But Brian! I just want you to feel the joy that I feel.
I mean the Church makes me feel accepted and safe and part of something bigger that myself.
But Meg, you don't need an outside voice to feel those feelings, they're inside you.
What you call God is inside you, all of us.
And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.
Just when you thought the world couldn't be any more dangerous
Channel 5 News has discovered that there is an atheist among us.
Local church goer and juniour christian soldier Meg Griffin has identified the atheist as Brian Griffin of Spooner Street
At least they belive in a God. Even if it's a smelly brown God.
Meg, how the hell could you do something like this?
Alright, what's the worst that could happen, this is the twenty first century, people are tolerant.
Well, this is nothing, probably just a random act of violence.
I thought only he without sin could cast the first Prius.
Ever since Meg told everyone I'm an atheist I'm the most hated person in town.
I try to rent a movie and they threw me out. I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they threw me out.
But the most serious part of it is no bar would serve me a drink!
Well if you ask me me, I think laying off the sauce could do you some good Brian.
Yeah, right. If you need me I'll be in the kitchen.
All he does is eat pies off the high counter.
Next time around we're gonna get ourselves a big tall pie-eating dog, Lois
Yeah you big silly arse. Just wrap your lips around me and take a big gulp.
Alright, everybody got your bowling shoes, everybody got your balls.
Jonathan, we were just up at the counter. Why didn't you get your shoes?
Well I think it's just because they want another dollar fifty from me.
I don't know how to change it, I already typed it in!
I know, I know. Hey, you mind spreading the news around town, say maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam
Of course Brian, but first we have work to do.
God's work. And God will be happy that you're joining me.
Then I say let's celebrate the way they did in the bible.
I feel the warm healing liquid presence of God's genuine cold filtered grace.
And now, we get to do the work of the Lord.
Meg, I can't be a part of this. And either should you.
What are you talking about? I thought you'd seen the light, Brian!
Well, to be honest I lied for booze, but Meg, you're a smart girl
You ought to be able see that what's going on here is wrong!
You are not gonna turn me from my faith, Brian!
If there were a God would he put you here on Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?
Would he give you a smoking hot mom like Lois and then have you grow up looking like Peter?
And what kind of God would put you in a house where no one respects or cares about you?
Not even enough to get you a damn mumps shot!
Oh that's all part of the human experience. It's what we're here to find out.
And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.
Now, try to go to sleep, cause we gotta get up in the morning and make movies.
You people have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for me
You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with.
There was nothing for five tickets, we've been over this!
Well, but LeVar and I were going to pool ours for the Fuzzy Troll pencil topper
Three days at my house, three days at LeVar's and alternating sundays.
Peter, I want you and the guys to come over to my house right now.
Alright, hang on. I gotta go to the bathroom first.
Watch when I scratch his bottom. He sticks his fanny in the air.
Oh, oh. We have lift off. We have lift off.
Since I found this little guy living under my house.
Yeah, like when I went over to his house the other day.
Oh, I don't think Quagmire wants me to do that.
I don't think Quagmire appreciated the condition you returned it in last time.
You want us to sign a card for your cat?
God, I hate having to come up with something on the spot.
I'm heading off to Vermont to get James' birthday present.
There's this neat little store called Cattitudes that makes all this neat cat stuff.
He's goin' all the way to Vermont for cat gifts and what-not?
You can get a scratcing post down at Wal Mart for $2.00
Y'know they got seats for children now? You put 'em right in your car.
Only problem is, you can't lean your seat all the way back ... oh.
Oh boy, I usually only get this excited when they say the title of the movie in the movie.
I'm telling you these drug dealers represent a Clear and Present Danger to the United States.
All I'm sayin' is what if this As Good As It Gets?
The only way for me to solve this crisis is to be Superman IV.
Hey, lets take a man- sized poop in his cat box so he thinks there's something really wrong with him.
How 'bout we hide the cat's body and leave that window open and that way, it'll seem like the cat ran away.
Y'know, Peter, it's sorta adding insult to injury raiding Quagmire's fridge for beer after you killed his cat.
Almost as much as I hated my overly sensitive car alarm.
He's got shovels in there, and a hand drawn map titled This is where we'll hide the body.
Brian, if you don't mind, we'll start thinkin' up our prison rape jokes immediately.
Hey, Brian, did you do 'Hard Time' or 'Hardly Working?'
And when we get to the car would you like a donut to sit on?
Ha ha ha. Y'see, I'm part of it. I'm part of it like everyone else.
I can't believe they threw me in jail for a quarter ounce of pot.
No, no. Pot is illegal because William Randolph Hearst ran a smear campaign against marijuana in the 1930's to protect his interests in the timber industry because hemp was poised to replace wood as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.
Brian, under your probation you're required to submit to random drug tests.
Look, I don't really feel comfortable doing this in front of you.
Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test and if I give him some of mine he's gonna know I've been smoking pot so I need some of your urine so I can ...
Uh ... you don't have to be naked for this.
But I don't have to NOT be naked for it, either. Ah-ha ...
Brian, you know I can't go unless you stare at it.
Brian, is this how you're trying to pass your drug test?
No, what's sick is making marijuana illegal when it's been proven that it does less damage to you than alcohol.
No, what's sick is the plot of the movie Baby Mama.
What happens when a 40 year old woman asks her 41 year old friend to carry her baby?
Brian, when you have to go to these lengths just to get away with smoking pot it's time to make a change.
Oh, come on guys, it's just the way God made me.
We, as American adults with free will have the right to use marijuana if we choose to!
If you want to win people over, you can't just drone on like Ben Stein.
# When I tell you every person  needs a way of feeling good #
# Every kitty needs a ball of string and every dog a stick #
# but all you need is a bag of weed to really get a kick #
# A bag of weed,  a bag of weed #
# oh, everything is better with a bag of weed #
# it's the only help that you'll ever need #
# because everything is better with a bag of weed #
# but all we need is a bag of weed #
# Oh, a bag of weed, a bag of weed #
# oh, everything is better with a bag of weed #
# oh, you you don't need meth  and you don't need speed #

# oh, everything is better with a bag of weed #
# You're a happy guy when you plant the seed #
# Oh, everything is better with a bag of weed #
I still don't think I'm comfortable with the whole idea.
Look Lois, ever since marijuana was legalized   crime has gone down, productivity is up, and ratings forl Dr. Who are through the roof.
Yeah, but Peter's so vague lately he can hardly set up a cut away.
Thanks to your dog's stupid marijuana crusade, people are using hemp for everything.
My back is hurting from the chair I'm sitting on.
And the only way to do that is to start a fear campaign designed to turn people against pot.
I .. I could never go against Brian like that.
You can use it today, and one more day in the summer.
I got the idea ... from ... from ... while   from while I was smoking pot.
Now let's go to France and steal all their objects ... de... arte ...
Apparently they own the rights to Hitler's likeness and they won't have him slandered.
You know me from the movie Harold, Kumar and Peter go to White Castle
As you can see, I'm enjoying a White Castle burger.
It took me 5 minutes to get to White Castle.
Y'know, Neil Patrick Harris got the job on How I Met Your Mother 'cos of that movie?
Y'know, I've only seen that show once but I gotta tell ya,  what's really weird to me is why is the voice of the guy from the future, Bob Saget?
I mean, the guy on the show ... he's already an adult.
Y'know, so it's not like he's gonna grow in to Bob Saget.
Look, daddy, I agree with what you're trying to do, but I just don't think this is gonna work.
Peter, the reason Brian succeeded in his cause is that he spoke with such passion.
No offence, but you two just don't have that talent.
That's how I used to lure wayward sailors to their deaths with my Siren song.
It's your novel, Brian, Faster than the speed of Love
All you have to do is publicly come out against pot.
And I even commissioned an oil painting for your author's photo.
Plus I can get you a night in bed with Oprah.
Your novel .. is good enough .. to be published .. on it's own .. merits
All you gotta do is make an impassioned anti-pot speech in public.
Even Stewie says the book is good enough on its own.
Right, Stewie? ... Ermmm ... maybe do a song about why pot is bad.
I've heard all I need to make an informed decision.
In other news, a local Quahog author has set a record for the worst selling novel of all time.
has astonishingly not sold a single copy thanks to universal panning by literary critics.
Coming up, children are getting sexier ... and that's   that's pretty cool.
I sold out everything I believed in, and I have nothing to show for it.
Well, look at it this way .... you did accomplish something.
Marijuana's illegal because of you, and Stewie got to build a nice little fort with all of your unsold books.
I want you to know I'm raising my reward to 50 dollars for anyone who can help me find James.
Oh, Joe, thank you so much for  inviting us to your barbeque.
Hey, can one of you weathermen come over here and comment on the meat while I'm cookin' it?
Yeah, don't flip 'em too often, now. You don't wanna lose the juices.
Scoop that one up and put it back down in the exact same spot.
Oh boy! I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.
Wow, Bonnie, you really took off the baby weight quickly.
Hey, do mind rubbing some of that sun-block on my back?
Ooh, but I don't wanna get any on my shirt.
I won't let you walk out of here without that dress.
You've got that thing for the opening of the library next week.
Mom says I'm the one who's hair it's OK to cut.
Ha! Your kid got beat up by a baby girl.
Oh man, this is more painful to watch than when Family Ties does a Tina Yothers episode.
What was weird, was that she was crying   but the way she was standing over me, made it look like I was crying.
Peter, what exactly are you worried is gonna happen because of this?
There has to be a World War 3 and 4 first.
Uh, so, I heard you talking in the hall the other day about how much you liked High School Musical 2, so I burned you the soundtrack.
B: When I said I enjoyed it, I was speaking ironically.
No, that's impossible, because I've seen that big hairy mud flap arse of yours in the locker room.
The joke's kind of on us, 'cos we're smellin' it.
I'm gonna switch to one of the other popular guys.
But Connie, you've gone out with, like, every popular boy in this school.
What if ... wait, now bear with me on this ...
What if I date a loser and make him over into a popular guy?
Alright, Stewie, your dad's gonna help you learn how to be a man.
Real men have a couple of beers, and then project their inadequacies on their kids.
So I guess you think you woulda been some sort of big shot by my age, huh?
No, I also got an orange peel and a picture of mom eating a turkey leg.
Oh my God, Connie's coming over to talk to me!
Chris Griffin, you are undoubtedly the most unpopular boy in school.
You and I are going on a date Saturday night.
She must be more drunk than  Santa Claus when he got that D.U.I.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step outta the sleigh.
Alright, Stewie, we're gonna get you nice and pumped up.
Well, if there's anyone I can trust it's a stranger at the gym holding a dirty needle.
Well, will you look at me. I HAVE THE POWER!!
We now return to Lady and the Tramp and Michael Vick.
Well, I took him to the gym and the colorful gent there advised me that I put him on steroids.
I look like a guy who's been hittin' the gym.
It has nothing to do with the gym. You're on drugs.
Doesn't matter how you find the pot o' gold, B to the rian
Doesn't have to make sense when you look like this.
I am hotter than phone sex with a blind girl.
Playin' the greatest Rock 'n' Roll hits of all time.
We have a lot of work to do before we go inside.
Alright, if I'm gonna be seen with you we have to do something about that look.
No, you look like you don't care, and that's good.
Um, if we're dating, does that mean when we go in there
I want to hold your hand 'cos I like you.
Well, I think you're nice ... and I like spending time with you.
You're really pretty and I hope I get to be with you for a long time.
No guy's ever said anything that nice to me before.
Cool! Maybe we could go see that Chazz Palminteri/ Paul Sorvino movie Distracting Trumpet
I wanna thank you all for comin' out here today.
Our friend needs to get a message to the short man in the hat.
He needs to deliver this message before the construction site contracts are handed down.
It's of vital importance that these matters be attended to.
So we may have to bring in our friend from Yonkers!
I said we may have to bring in our friend from Yonkers!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is there a problem? Huh?
Wow, the jocks have never said hello to me before.
Yeah. In fact, I'm going to his house for dinner tonight so I can meet his parents.
I just hope dad doesn't embarrass us, like he did when that one legged guy came over.
Aaaaaaah   course, you're probably not really into tibia ... trivia
They say we lost a foot of snow last winter ...
I bet you like the taste of hops ... Aaaah ....
We're so excited that Chris is finally bringing a girl home for dinner.
Um, do you mind if I ask what's up with your baby?
I'm not satisfied until every vein is forced up against my skin.
If there's one thing women  love, it's a vascular man.
I've got veins. They carry  blood all over my bahdy.
Well, to answer your question, Connie, apparently I'm married to a man who thinks it's OK to inject an infant with steroids.
So, Connie, now that you're dating my brother, maybe we can hang out, y'know?
Hey, after dinner, you wanna come up to my room and give each other makeovers?
But keep it on the down low, so the spazoids don't catch wind.
You and I are gonna be at the same party this weekend.
Hey, what are you wearing, so I make sure I don't wear the same thing.
There's an arse to boob ratio that you're way off of.
Hey, Chris! C'mon, let's corner the nerds and call them gay and make them show us their penises.
Oh, Meg, sweetheart why don't you just go downstairs and join the party?
Oh, look, honey, he's just a little confused about who he is right now.
I'm sure, deep down, he still loves his big sister.
OK, look, Meg, I've been at this for 45 minutes
Here's a Sylvia Plath book and a bottle of Ambien.
I'm gonna look the other way, and whatever happens, happens.
No, Connie, beating up that Jewish kid made me popular.
I guess I should lie on top of her to keep her warm.
Chris, I can't believe you dissed Connie at your party.
Yeah, I heard about it when I was making that gay nerd spoon with me.
Do you really think I would help you out in any way, after everything you've done to me?
This is from when you called me sticky arse cow in 6th grade.
This one is from when you made a plaster cast of my vagina, freshman year.
When we're done with him, he'll be more of an outcast than a seagull at an Adam Sandler movie.
This is my old bicycle that I had from when I was ten.
When I ring the bell, it makes my pants feel funny.
And now ... here's something we hope you'll really like.
Once Chris gets up there, my friend in the AV department will take care of everything.
I do this for you, and I have your permission to think about you later tonight when I'm in the tub.
Before we begin, Chris Griffin has an announcement for the cool kids.
The meeting of the Cool Kids Club will be at 3:15 leaning up against Tim Breckner's SUV in the parking lot.
Connie, the person who humiliated you has himself been humiliated.
By the rules of high school, you are now popular again.
There no chance we're gonna  be friends now, is there?
Can I at least think about you in the tub later?
And Meg, I'm really sorry I was such a douche.
Well, there is a way you can make it up to me.
Tell me what it was like ... being one of them.
Looks like she finally found someone after dating that last loser.
No. See how I set up my own joke? You walked right into it, Brian.
Walk right in. Sit right down. Stewie's gonna make you the fool.
No, doesn't look like it. Oh, yeah, here it is.
Ah, cool, Mrs G. Thanks for lettin' me stay here the last couple of weeks.
Ouch! Well, Brian, looks like you're the odd man out.
Bless us, oh Lord, for these gifts we are about to receive.
Help us to be mindful of all our blessings ... and ...
Brian, I'm filling out my RSVP card ... and I don't know whether I should get the salmon or the snausages.
Big deal! I couldn't care less about going to that wedding.
Look on the bright side. It frees you up to go to Cleveland's barbeque.
None of this is awkward. I've moved on from Jillian.
Well, that picture, y'know, it was posted a couple of years ago.
Well, it's a Retriever mix   b ... bra ... doodle.
Fine! If you're so over her, we should all go out to dinner.
I would have no problem with that. I'd love to meet the fiance.
Great! And I'm sure Dushawn would love to meet you.
I hate how he pushes his bangs out of his face with every word he says.
Jillian, don't you want your own father to give you away?
Well then, Peter would be happy to do the honours.
Plus, when's the next time you're gonna get to give a bride away?
I know. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
You can give me away when I get married, dad.
Yeah, can I have, ah, this 3rd thing down, please?
Ha, I don't think I could do that again in a million years.
Ahhh ... I don't know. I actually just had elbow surgery.
I wasn't even supposed to come in to work today ...
You know, I can probably help you with that elbow.
Excuse me, I'm just gonna use the restroom really quick.
Shutup! He's obviously some sort of Superman. I just   I just need to know if he has any shortcomings that'll make me feel better.
You are not even ... You're goin' in there to look ... That's even gayer.
No, no .. it's just .. I .. I mean .. I probably had a lot to drink last night so if I did anything that might have offended you, I'm .. I'm sorry.
No, it's OK, I have a dog so I've had to cut poop out of his fur before.
Yeah, um ... Hey, y'know, if you don't mind ...
I'm gonna take off before anybody gets the wrong idea here.
Hey ... Brian, is that you? Is that Lauren Con ...?
I was shoppin' for hats ... Hang on! I'm coming over!
Oh, it's just this jerk that goes to my school.
No, I just lied to you and I'm not really sure why.
Oh, my God! How do you two know each other?
I love the show. Do you need a gay friend on the show .. a friend on the show?
Hey, you know what? I'm actually on my way to go shoot now if you want, you guys can tag along.
Yes, we would love to. Brian, don't wreck this for me.
Oh, my God! I have the perfect hat for this.
Listen, Lauren, I'm not .. not super comfortable being on camera.
Oh, relax. After a little while you'll forget they're even there.
What's everybody looking at? The salesman told me it was unisex.
Ah, that's Heidi and Spencer. I don't really talk to them.
Whatta ya want? I came out to Hollywood, I'm on camera all day and I turned my back on my own kind.
I can't believe that came out of Bruce Jenner's vagina.
No, Brian. That's what the Press would have you believe. But he's not.
Bruce Jenner is a woman. An elegant, beautiful, Dutch woman.
Lauren, we've got a rough cut of next week's episode.
I need to be, like, fine, to be alone, and, like, not even want to date someone and then I know I'll be fine to get into a relationship.
It's OK. They fill the rest with shots of street signs, and fronts of restaurants and old footage from the A Team.
Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I got a little wrecked after dinner and I didn't wanna drive home.
Oh, yeah? Did you stay in town or did you head for 'The Hills?'
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Wait a minute! How the hell do you guys know about that already?
Oh, yeah, I know that guy. His name's Brian Griffin and he definitely boned Lauren last night.
Well, I think it's wonderful that  you're datin' such a classy, well educated girl like Lauren Conra ... ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.
Yeah, you know something, Brian. I bet you make the late night monologues.
I mean, it's a little weird isn't it,  this new Lauren Conrad relationship?
When asked about their sex life, Brian was quoted as saying Oh, yeah, we just do it me style.
Have you seen the news about Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin?
Y'know, a lot of these young Hollywood girls carry their little dogs around in their purse.
Yeah, so Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin are now a couple.
Apparently she gave that dog a bone and ... he gave it right back!
Look, I was drunk outta my mind, I didn't know what I was doing.
It was a one night thing. I have no interest in dating one of those shallow idiot celebrities who's only famous for being famous.
Hey, tell her I like her work in Jake and the Fatman.
Yeah, I'm Brian. I'm, ah, the guy all the comedians have been talking about.
Oh, si! Ha ha ha ha ha. Lauren is in the back.
I find Aristfanes' quasi satirical origin myth regarding the three genders both fantastic and serious.
Yeah, that .. er .. that always cracked me up.
Yeah, but I try not to let it interfere with my biomolecular research.
It'll make you feel ... young, as when the world was new.
The life forms grew later at a substantially accelerated rate.
This doesn't make any sense. If you're so smart why do you hide it?
Come on, Brian. You know America doesn't like smart people.
Yeah, once, but .. so this whole  persona is just a publicity stunt?
We're even using state of the art computer animation to create a fake sex tape with me and Bill Cosby.
Now, you will get ready for the zim zam and the babbidy bibbedy. and you will take off your clothes, like vooo and voooom and get ready for the most splendiferous pudding pop you have ever seen.
Alright, Jillian, since I'm giving you away on your wedding day
I wanna make sure it all goes off without a hitch.
Oh, I thought that maybe I would just DJ the wedding myself.
Well, be that as it may,  or not be that, I was thinkin'  I could be your wedding singer.
Sweet! And I promise you'll be able to understand all the words.
Not like Sting where you can only understand the last 3. ... brand new day ..
No, I didn't. As a matter of fact, she's coming over for dinner tonight.
Well, Lauren, it's a real pleasure havin' you here for dinner.
Of course, I'm sure this isn't as exciting as your usual cuisine.
They don't use metal because it reacts chemically with the fish eggs and changes their taste.
You could have just complimented the free food, but one upping me is another way to go.
Lauren just finished a fascinating doctoral thesis on sub-orbital propulsion mechanisms that NASA is using for the next generation of space shuttles.
So, Lauren, um, whenever  I'm watchin' your show   you give me wood.
So, Lauren, do you and Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan
They'll rape me! And I'll never see 'em coming, no I won't.
Well, uh, Lauren and I had a great time today at the Art museum.
There was a special exhibition of rare Monet paintings ...
But no big deal. People make that mistake all the time.
Y'know, I don't mean to be rude, but do you have a more comfortable chair?
Oh, my God! Quagmire, you come out from under there!
I'm sorry everybody. I just wanted to meet her so bad.
Oh, sweetie, dinner with your family was so much fun tonight.
It was so cute when you thought Manet was Monet.
Yeah .. yeah .. that .. that was a hoot.
Oh, hey, how are you liking my unabridged history of 2nd World War naval tactics in the Pacific theatre?
I'm at the part where they detail the account of Admiral Halsey's victory at Midway.
Well, Halsey was hospitalized with cirrhosis at the outset of the battle so Spruance, who prior to June of 1941, was primarily a desk Admiral was charged with leading the naval fleet at Midway against Japan.
And in fact, was a turning point for the American naval forces in the Pacific.
Oh, my God, you're so cute when you don't know what you're talking about.
Well, wait a minute. What the hell does that mean?
You don't have to be. You're adorable. Like those calendars that have monkeys in clothes.
Look, why don't we talk about this in the morning?
I can see the little Austin Powers logo on the side.
This is about you still being in love with Jillian.
Y'know, I thought I was over her, but .. I'm .. I'm not.
Somewhere along the line she must have gotten under my skin.
I'm in love with her. How could I have been so miopic?
My God, Lauren. What am I gonna do? I'm still in love with Jillian.
Maybe she just needs to be reminded how much she misses you.
She needs to see you on the arm of a beautiful woman.
This isn't working at all. She doesn't even know we're here.
Oh, she will, Brian. And she's gonna be upset that your date is so into you.
Ok, ready? I've been reading up on things that sound sexy. Oh, Brian, I can't wait til after dinner
'cause then we'll go home and you can watch me have my period.
Well, I wish we could stay. But we have quite an exciting evening planned.
Uh, well, have fun. You two are a really cute couple.
That's it. I mean, I don't know what else I can do. The wedding's tomorrow and she hasn't shown any signs of leaving Derek.
Go for broke. Just throw all your cards on the table at once.
Show her that you love her in a way she can't possibly ignore.
I want you .. no .. I need you with all my heart and soul. And my only regret is that I didn't realize it when we were together.
I mean, I thought you were my 'Soul Train' ..
Soul Food? I'm sorry ... but I'm in love with Derek now.
I mean, he's everything I have especially since my mom died of cancer.
Alright, party people. Please clear the dance floor for the bride and groom's first dance.
And here to sing a romantic ballad is the one and only Sting. ... fields of gold.
You may have lost Jillian but you can at least be happy that she's happy.
Y'know, Lois has bitchin' lately that I watch too much TV and don't read enough books.
So I went to the library and picked up three books by the greatest author of the last thousand years.
We begin with a little tale called Stand by Me about 4 young boys who went looking for a dead body and instead found ..... themselves. ... and also a dead body.
The year was 1955 and the voice in my head was that of Richard Dreyfuss.
I never had friends like the ones I had when I was 12.
If you don't want to have drinks, just say so.
He had sex when he was five and committed his first rape when he was ten.
I can still see him now all pudgy and black.
Please re-enter the clubhouse in a more stereotypically animated fashion.
Lord a'mighty! I done seen me a dead body down by the lake!
Sho' nuff, I thought I'd go deef and dumb when I saw me that dead body!
Anything was possible as we set out that day except contracting AIDS because AIDS had not yet been invented by the government in an effort to eradicate the homosexual community.
Have Gun, Will Travel, reads the card of a man
Even though legend had it, that any kid caught scaling the fence ran the risk of being attacked by the old man's dog. who would charge to the cry of Chopper, sick balls
Now, he said sic 'em, boy, but what I heard was Chopper, talk to disfigured World War 2 veterans who aren't as bitter as they should be.
Even though it was just invented, we already remember it fondly.
Couldn't we have just taken a bus? ..... black guy.
Uh, guys, anyone know when the next train is scheduled?
Don't worry. If a train comes I'll warn you in slow motion.
Thanks for goin' all the way back to the junkyard to get me this wheelchair.
The twisted and mangled body we had come to see was far more disgusting than any of us could ever have imagined.
I mean, you have a gun right now, but tomorrow
I'll get a gun and come to your house and kill you.
Oh .... yeah, I guess you could do that, huh?
And I just can't be on my guard for the rest of my life.
We never forgot that wonderful summer, and eventually, we all went our seperate ways.
Joey learned to live without the use of his legs, and even went on to create a wheelchair type rugby game called Don't-feel-sorry-for-us-ball
Cleve grew up and went on to marry Rebecca Romjin.
The fat kid from Stand by Me is now married to Rebecca Romjin.
Unfortunately, about a week ago, he took an overdose of designer drugs at the Viper Room.
And now, we're left with a hair lipped reminder of what might have been.
Joaquin Phoenix, if you're still watching, you are a good sport and a trooper.
And you passed our test, and you can be our friend.
And now for a segment we like a little less than the first and the last ...
I've finished the book and Snuggly Jeff is dead and the readers are just gonna love it.
Paul, I still wish I could talk you out of this.
Snuggly Jeff is the most succesful children's book series ever.
Yeah, but I wanna get into writing more serious stuff.
Y'know, something where the reader doesn't have a load in his pants while he's lookin' at it.
The Weather Service has reported a big snow storm on its way.
You were in a terrible car accident and you broke both your legs.
Um, Paul, quick question, and feel free to say no, but I couldn't help but notice the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript in your bag, and, I was wondering if I could read it then kill you if I hate it?
Can I read it while I touch your ear and suck my thumb?
Look, Stewie, I've gone as far as I can with Snuggly Jeff, and I .. I wanna write something more serious
Well, you are gonna write Snuggly Jeff back to life, Mr. Man.
And second of all, I have to be inspired before I write.
Magnum, I've found a fingerprint smudge at the crime scene.
You can't just have Snuggly Jeff magically brought back to life by a child's wish.
Let's see ... How can I explain this to you?
So, like, they spent a trillion dollars building this mile high space machine and Jake Busey blows it up.
So, now they're all like: Oh, no. We can't use the space machine
But then this other guy's like: Hey, it just so happens, I built another identical trillion dollar space machine at my own expense, on the other side of the world
Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said: No! You can't go into space because the machine already got blown up by Jake Cock-a-Doody Busey!
Fine. But you're gonna have to go into town and get me some more paper.
Let me see if I can get the Big Wheels started.
Now I'm gonna have to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair!
If I let you go, you'll just run straight to the police and tell them I kidnapped you and held you hostage and fondled you while you were asleep.
Now, you remember that Stephen King story when the guy went up to the empty hotel and there were those creepy twins and a guy was runnin' around with that axe and a kid talked to his finger?
He was a fat drink of water, the kind of drink of water that y'know your friend got from the bathroom and not from the kitchen. fat one breaks first tonight.
A month went by before Andy said 2 words to somebody.
I understand you're a man who knows how to get things.
I .. I .. I don't understand what you just said.
I carve Star Wars figurines outta stone but it's also for not tunneling my way outta here.
Wow. Can you carve me a set of women's private parts out of stone?
Ah, we've only had one conversation but I can tell we're gonna be life long friends.
And since you're black and I'm white that makes it more especial for the audience.
Well, anyway, I'm a pretty corrupt guy so I figured I could sell your figurines and pocket the cash.
I'll even cripple that guy who rapes you in the shower.
Boggs never walked again, and Andy's farts never made a sound again.
Thanks to the Star Wars figurines Andy carved, he landed a cushy job cleanin' the warden's office.
OK, you clean up the warden's office while I go pop out a pine cone.
To this day, I have no idea what that woman was singin' about.
But I have to imagine it's a foul disease ridden thing that wears too much makeup to cover up the fact that it's a 47 year old fish dog.
Andy, I think you know why I've called you in here today.
A prison is an environment which requires the highest level of discipline ... and that little stunt you pulled today
.. that little stunt you pulled today made a lot of people look very foolish.
I'm gonna take the poop pipe to the crap swamp.
Up in a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, under an old oak tree, there's a rock that has no earthly business bein' there.
Under that rock is a box with somethin' I want you to have.
Course, now that I think about it, I've been in her 25 years
If it is, pick yourself up some nice cheap pants and good life to you.
Dufresne, you better get your arse out here before here before you make me cut this sentence shor ....
I could just throw a rock at that poster of David Cassidy.
What the warden and his boys didn't realise was that Andy Dufresne had escaped from Shawshank Prison the night before.
Andy Dufresne, the man who crawled through a river of poop and came out clean on the other side.
Do you believe, in your best judgement, that you have been rehabilitated?
It's just a stupid made up word so boys like you can sit behind a desk, wear a fancy suit, and feel important.
You're a jerk! And I had sex with your mother last night!
And I swear to God, you let me out of here, first thing I'm gonna do is kill again.
When I got outta Shawshank, there was only one thing on my mind.
A promise I made to a friend that I had to keep.
Walk along the stone wall until you reach the tree, and that's where you'll find the rock.
If you've come this far, maybe you're willing to go a little further.
You remember the name of the town in Mexico, right?
Where the hell is that jagoff? There's like 1200 bucks in that box.
Oh, my God, if he ran off with that ...
And what am I gonna do? Go to the authorities?
Now, what? I gotta spend the rest of my life here by myself?
Well, at least I won't have to be self conscious about my farting.
I dunno, but I ordered him a beer and now it's just sittin' there lookin' lonlier than Alan Rickman's answering machine.
Hello, Alan Rickman. It's Alan Rickman reminding you to move the pork chops from the freezer to the refigerator so they defrost properly.
Hey, y'all, I want you to meet my cousin from Jamaica,
Eh heh, you sound like the crab from Little Mermaid.
You gotta by that cream that comes with the little comb.
She can tell you what you were in a past life.
Ah ... it's another pleasant day for me, Peter the Strawberry.
Wait ... whadda ya ... uh ... uh... hey .. hey ... hey, get outta here!
What d'you say, Joe? You want your past life read?
Ah, that's so cool! That's so cool! Do me next!
I see you in London. I think it's the 1800's.
Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me.
You were Griffin Peterson, the founder of the city of Quahog.
Now wait a second, Cool Runnings. We learned in school that Miles Chatterbox Musket founded Quahog, after he was saved by the magic clam.
I see ... I see England a long time ago.
It is a crisp, clear Spring morning, and Griffin Peterson is ridin' to the home of his beloved.
Peterson, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be down at your job, making oblong bricks out of manure and straw?
I wanna marry your daughter. and I'm here to ask for your blessing.
Well, I'm one of the few guys in this town who isn't dying a slow, painful diarrhoea death.
I was just walkin' off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.
Yes, I will, Griffin. Oh, I thought you'd never ask.
Ooh yah yah yah oh boy yah yah yah yah ...
But in another part of London there was a man who was not in such good spirits.
Oh .... I'm so bored. I wish to be entertained.
Presenting ... the cast of How I Met Your Mother.
Well, you're right, I guess I did break the bro' code.
Well, yeah. We get a pretty sizeable chunk of Princes 18 to 34.
I think I'd like to delete this from my TIVO.
I .. I like to tell stories from my life and let the humour flow organically from everyday situations.
She always had the most wonderful spirit, even when her mind started to go.
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
And I said, Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong. You need to take out one of the M's.
Y'know, you're gonna be #@%*!@$ dead in 5 seconds if aunt Frieda doesn't throw a pie at somebody!
I mean, part of that is you sorta have to know my family ...
Ah ha ha. Well, now I'm in a wonderful humour.
Hey, coachman. Let's drive on the left side of the road and see if that catches on.
That piece of arse is marrying that tall glass of poop juice?
Well, not if I have anything to say about it.
A woman of that calibre should be married to a King.
I'm going to have him exiled to the farthest corner of the world.
I've seen it, actually, and .. and it's, like,  you don't even want to make fun of it,
Yeah, it's like that one grape in the bunch that never got to be a grape.
Remember, he's tubby. It takes him a while to move around.
What a wonderfully exciting day. I'm young, I'm all dressed up, and I'm on my way to marry the woman I love.
And there's 290 years separating me from the films of Kevin Smith.
Well, that's something we didn't really think out too well when we started ... but never mind that!!
I'm shipping you out on the first boat to the new world.
Ohhhhh, come on now. There, feel better after I just said that?
I hate this. I .. I .. I hate my life!
As a citizen, I'm proud to have you reign over me and the McAfee Fertilizer company.
Lady Redbush, I wish I was here on a happier errand.
But I'm afraid I must inform you that Griffin Peterson is dead.
Now that some time has passed, do you wanna go out?
With Griffin Peterson exiled to the new world and Lady Redbush believing he was dead,
Our love is like two figs hanging from a fig tree, cradled by Cupid's own hand.
OK, right now. You have a time slot. Go there!
Maybe finish this candy bar before you open another one.
Well, at least it wasn't one of those promos where they've got the whole cast shoving each other playfully,  like they're all good pals.
Oh, oh, look! There we go! Oh, look at 'em jostling each other around.
Oh, they give each other a hard time, but they're friends.
No, it's just ... no, it's .. somebody's makin' a joke. Forget it.
Meanwhile, Griffin Peterson and the other exiles passed the time on the ship to the new world.
I got caught pleasuring myself to a painstakingly etched engraving of the wife of Bath.
Ah, I slept with an underaged virgin to cure my puff penis.
Hey, fellers. You wanna join me in a game of mumble peg?
.. mumble .. mumble .. mumble .. .. mumble .. mumble .. mumble ..
Griffen Peterson and his shipmates  finally reached the new world.
This place is nothin' but a wilderness. What're we gonna do?
We'll have a happy new life, and we'll have equal rights for all.
And I mean white white, so no Italians, no Polish. Just people from Ireland, England, and Scotland.
Oh, it's quite good. I'm also enjoyin' the turtled hen.
So, listen. You and I need to have a conversation about you not bearing me a son.
We have to have sex in order for me to bear you a son.
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired, and I've had so much work, and I think .. I think I wanted to the other day but I couldn't find you. So, y'know, it's like both of  us on our schedules, y'know?
Oh, darn it! I'm going to be so horny tomorrow at four.
Y'know, I gotta say, I'm a little mad at you for not bein' more available.
Griffin Peterson and the other colonists worked day and night to build their new settlement, until finally, after much hard work, the colony of Quahog was complete.
It didn't take long before Quahog was a thriving new world settlement, bustling with life.
Time had helped Griffin forget Lady Redbush, and soon he found himself a hearty new wife.
I don't know what to do, jester. I can't be married to the King anymore.
My heart still belongs to Griffin Peterson, but he's dead.
I was ordered to keep silent by the King, under threat of execution but .. you're gonna see this anyway.
Oh, my God! He's alive! Jester, I've got to get to him.
I'll help you. But only if I can go with you.
If I stay here, the King'll execute me for telling you all this.
Well .. OK. But how are we gonna get there?
We'll hitch a ride on one of the slave ships tomorrow night, after an all new Shovin' Buddies.
And so Lady Redbush sailed off to the new world. to find her beloved.
And the timin' was good, because  his new wife was a pain in him arse.
.. and then I finished scrubbing the kettle but .. then I saw that I'd missed a spot and, oh .. I was so worried that the whole thing wasn't clean enough so I went back and started washing it again, and sure enough ...
.. I'd missed another spot, and there was a clump of cornmeal
from when I made breakfast.  Shut up, Meg! I prithee, shut up!
And so, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush were happily reunited.
Of course, Griffin had to go through the complex, extensive divorce procedure required by 18th century society.
Well, I mean, sometimes we .. we..  we sleep .. we.. we go to different .. er, we go to bed at.. at different times. We've both been so busy ... it's been .. rediculous! I .. I thought she was takin' a class or something.
Damn it! Oh, I wanted to do sex to her tonight.
Months rolled by, and Griffin and Lady Redbush continued to flourish happily in the colony of Quahog, completely unaware that King Stewart was on the march.
Here I am, sir. Yessir, right indeed, here indeed, yes I am, sir.
I want you to turn this  settlement upside down until you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson.
That fat bastard thinks he can steal my bride and get away with it
No, I wouldn't. Not a corn farthing would I bet. No sir.
Little wrong in the head, I am, from eatin' some bad sausages. Yes, bad sausages that I eat, indeed, sir.
Oh, Griffin, this time together has been the happiest of my life.
All those months I was without you, I never stopped seein' your face in the back of my wife's head.
And all those months I was sailin' for the new world
I found 'em, your Majesty. Indeed, yes I did found 'em, did I
I'm gonna take my wife back, and then I'm gonna kill you!
Let me just, uh, walk over here and get your things for you.
Alright, your Majesty. If you wanna leave with your pal in one piece, I suggest you throw down your weapons.
Go ahead and kill him, Griffin. You kill him, and I'll kill her.
Ha ha ha. This is me laughing. You kill him, I'll kill her.
Wait! Wait! There's gotta be a better way to settle this.
Hear ye! Hear ye! This talent competition will decide rightful possession of the good Lady Redbush and control of the colony of Quahog.
We first present King Stewart of England with some observational humour.
She always had the most wonderful spirit, even when her mind started to go.
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
This .. this is my bit. These .. these are all my bits.
And I said, Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong. You need to take out one of the M's.
We're out here on stage tonight to do a show for you
We got Peterson on the violin and Quagmire and Joe will be joinin' in
We got Stumpy Shamus on the lead guitar and he's gonna give you a great big ...
I .. I didn't know we could rip off movies.
And from then on, Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson lived in peace and happiness.
And I wanna be there there when you die, giving birth to it.
And so ends the tale of Griffin Peterson and the founding of Quahog.
Now stay tuned for an all new Cross Armed Opposites.
Step right up and see the amazing half man, half clam!
That means you'll have to clean up after him and feed him.
I didn't do it. I got it from a farm.
What the hell kind of farm breeds pigs like this?
Like you already kinda knew what I was talkin' about.
That was wonderful rock sex we had last rock night.
Yes, I enjoyed rocking you up the rock last night.
Hey, brian, want to get the rock out of here?
(happy): And now back to channel 5 news at 6:00.
Stewie, please tell me you know how to get us home.
I'm guessing this is quahog, but during some sort of ice age.
Uh, you want a treat?! You want a treat, boy?!
Oh, yeah, definitely. And, um, I'll, I'll give you a bath!
And, and I'll, I'll let you go for a ride in the car!
Where everyone has to take a poop right just now.
Yeah, that should work out pretty good for me, too.
Oh, stewie and brian, you're just in time for pie.
¶ you can ask all the birds in the sky ¶
¶ and they'll tell you real sweet with a musical tweet ¶
(quagmire's voice): ¶ it's a wonderful day for pie ¶
(cleveland's voice): ¶ and it smells a lot better than I ¶
¶ we all sing with glee 'cause we all agree ¶
(herbert's voice): You want a nice, shiny red apple to put in that pie?
Brian, we could spend the rest of our lives here.
Doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with this place.
Oh, but look at how shiny my buttons are here.
I should say so. We're in the robot chicken universe.
How's it feel to be on a major network for 30 seconds?
It says that in this universe, frank sinatra was never born,
Wow, so I guess lee harvey oswald never shot kennedy?
I don't know. The device can't make heads or tails of it.
It's just some sort of weird, low resolution blocky universe.
Here comes an overweight cat with dollar signs for eyes
Over a sad statue of liberty holding a democracy umbrella.
Oh, wait. It's not so bad. There's the compliment guy.
And you know, it's not as bad as you think.
Take your stinkin' paws off me, you damn dirty dog.
I mean, I kind of want to explore this universe.
Go on, pick it up. Do it-- pick up my poop!
Okay, I'm a a new neighbor and you're my pet human hotchkiss.
Who take me on expensive ski trips on spring break
That means there's a potential intruder at the front door
Or one of my pals. Either way, I'm really excited
And thought we'd stop in and say hi to our new neighbors.
Well, great to meet you. Come on in. I'm peter.
Nice to meet you. say hi to human brian, blake,
I swear to god, I hope the next universe we go to
We've been jumping randomly from one universe to the next.
Well, I've got one of my own. I can use it to send you back.
So don't misbehave or the human catcher'll come after you...
He's from another universe where dogs are subservient to humans.
You hear about it every night on the dog news.
Coming up, that bush in the park is my bush!
What do you mean? You can't come back to our universe.
Here in this great hall of justice are the most powerful forces of good ever assembled.
Dedicated to truth, justice and peace for all man kind
It's the new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Check it out.
Those swimsuit issues don't excite me like they used to. I've been spoiled by internet porn.
Quagmire, I would think you of all people would know about internet porn.
They got like thousands, literally million of naked pictures on the internet.
You mean that crappy dial-up thing? It's a pain in the ass!
No I don't use the damn internet!  I thought that was for nerds! Why didn't you guys tell me!
Oh yeah, you can even see Tonya Harding's honeymoon video on there.
You know, these women don't compare to the old swimsuit issues with Kathy Ireland.
You know, Horace still has one of those old beer promotional cutouts of her from like
Hey, you mean this thing? I was about to throw it out. If anyone wants it, it's theirs.
There's beauty up above and  things we never take notice of
You know... Lois won't be home from groceries for a while. I have an idea.
I love the time we spend together, you know that.
What the hell is going on? I sent you to pick up dinner an hour ago!
I know I been able to keep this a secret.   But Kathy and I are not actually working on a project together. We're... in love
Ugh, this is stupidest thing  he's done since he got in that turf war with that cat.
Now kids, you don't have to  call her mom right away, but I do want you guys to get along.
Just give her a chance, I think you'll like it.
Maybe she'll let us do things  that Lois won't let us do.
Oh, hello Lois... I would've thought  you would've moved in with your mother by now.
No Peter, I'm just pretty much letting this run its course.
Well I'm sorry you're handling this so poorly, but have you seen Kathy?
Uh Chris took her into his room about 10 minutes ago.
There you are! Oh, don't give me that look. You don't think I know where you been?
Did you have sex with that fat kid? Did you? Answer me!
Why did you have to provoke me? Whay did you hav...
I just been uhh...  checking out some of that internet porn.
Yeah yeah I'm good I'm good I'm good... I'm just gonna...
I'm... I'm sorry Peter, I gotta... I gotta get back.
Peter, settle down. Yes I forgive you, just as  long as you are done with that stupid cutout.
I just want you to know that everytime I was with her, I was thinking of you.
Oh, Lois, I've missed you! You and your wonderful smile and your beautiful eyes and your awesome third boob that's on top of the other boob.
What? Oh my god! Peter, that's not a boob, that's a lump!
Peter, stop that! We're not having sex! I just told you I have a lump!
I got a lump too and mine is easier to get rid of.
Mrs. Griffin, I've got good news. Your test results came back negative
It appears the lump in your breast is not black gross boob death
Now Mrs. Griffin, although you are in the clear for the moment, we need to have a look at your family medical history to determine your future risk.
Huh, that's curious. I didn't realize your  mother was a Holocaust survivor.
My mother? Oh no that's...  That's  impossible, she's not Jewish.
When we were married, Your father made me conceal the fact so he can get into country clubs.
Yes, when she moved to America,  her family changed their name.
Well, this kinda rocks my world., even more than the time When I went to that pediatrician.
I actually let myself believe I could  be a doctor's wife.
I really need some advice from an actual Jewish person.
I just don't know what to do with this information.
I'll tell you what you should do with it, absolutely nothing!
Like Quagmire, when he thought he was the one getting the spin-off
Have fun with your stupid *BEEP* giant chickens jokes and your Conway Twitty
Hey, why is there a moving truck outside Cleveland's house?
Well, I wouldnt put it quite like that but essentially Brian's right
Being Jewish doesn't really have to  change you or your family's life
There's no reason things should be any different around here.
Wow dad, where did you get all that glistening chest hair?
Look, this is my way of letting you know that I'm embracing who you are.
From now on I want you to use my Hebrew name.
Well, I... I caution you uhh... that becoming Jewish doesn't happen overnight.
It's a process that involves spiritual education and good works.
Look, Peter, I am the one  with the Jewish heritage, and I really don't want to make a big deal out of this.
Leave it to a Jew to take all  the fun outta being a Jew.
Now listen up, I like the hat and I like the scarf, so we are doing this.
Kids, from now on, this is where we will celebrate the Sabbath
Check it out! I'm one of you guys now huh.
God I feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor
As we approach the passover holiday, let us remember the struggle of our people as they labored under the yoke of Pharaoh's despotic rule.
Hey, if anyone appreciate a good yoke it's the yews
That's my Jewish laugh. I'm working on a Jewish laugh.
One of the best part about being Jewish is getting to take advantage of their excellent schools
Sitting around all day with a bunch of short, hairy guys,
I feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor
Didn't you... didn't you make that joke the other day?
Oh... yeah... No I was... I wasn't sure that everybody had umm ... had heard
And instead of lasting for one day, the oil in the lamp lasted for eight days,
Yeah yeah yeah, how long before we play Pin the eviction notice on the black guy's door.
Yeah I have a question. What are you gonna do when Jesus comes back and puts a boot up your ass?
And it's also why many families gives their children eight days of presents
Well, this Judaism thing is gonna be better than I thought.
You know what else? I picked out a sexy  little Jewish outfit for you at the store
Oh my God Lois, if you put on this long, thick dress right now I will lose it.
And if you put this shawl over your head ...
Oh, I swear to God, Lois. I swear to God that I would lose it.
Tell me I don't earn as much as your friend's husband!
We now return to Mark Wahlberg in Annoyed and confused
What's going on here? Where am I? What the... huh?
If you rescind your religion, you will spend eternity... in hell!
Then you better not fall for all the Jewish stuff.
Oh ... alright, if that's what you think is best.
Oh wait, dad, before you to go, can you say: Peter, you must go to the Degobah System?
Lois, last night my father came to me and reminded me that I am a good Catholic
If I don't rid the house of this Jewish curse, This family is gonna go to hell!
Peter, you were the only one who was even taking this thing seriously
It's the only religion with the word 'ew' in it.
Ah, come on. You're acting crazy, like when you were going through your Parker Lewis phase
Ah, that's just like the Parker Lewis episode when Parker Lewis ate dinner.
Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose. Don't even try and make him lose, because it's just gonna be that much more embarrassing for you
Suck on that?  Suck on this! TicTacs only have 1.5 calories!
How do you like it? Huh?  How do you like it?
I just had to get out of that house, Peter is being such a jackass
Lois, what Peter is doing to you is exactly what Carter did to me for years
But Mom, I don't really care about being Jewish,  or even Christian for that matter!
I just want to be a good person on my own.
All I'm saying is I let your father take my Jewish identity and I regreted it ever since.
I don't want to see you make the same mistake
Come on, you know you Jew girls want that dollar!
What... what does Jews like? Salmon! There's salmon over here!
No, you walk over there and he squirts you with a squirt gun
Relax, Lois, I was aiming for the mailbox,  I'm just trying to make point
No problem, Lois. that's just how people say hello to me.
What you did this morning was so far outta line, I just...
I can't just sit here and let you dump all over my heritage
But don't drag the rest of us down with you  like a mentally handicapped rooster.
This is my first time doing a Seder which is where we tell the story of the Jews escaped from bondage in Egypt
Doesn't it seems like every Jewish holiday has to do with them escaping from stuff?
Uhh... Lois, not that I'm rushing you, but when do we get to the wine drinking?
Hang on! Hang on! Before do anything I like to say a blessing over the candles, if I may.
Now bare with me, I haven't  had much rehearsal time.
And now let's move on to the washing of hands
Peter, you are not gonna ruin this Seder. Now get outta here.
Alright, I'm gonna go lie down, then I'm  gonna come back and mess up your Seder
I want you to get all this Jew food off the table.
I am a Catholic and I want live in a Catholic house
Well, I'm a Jew and I want live in a nicer house.
Peter, you have got to stop living in your own stupid worlds!
I'm sorry, but I can't be with someone who doesn't believe in Jesus.
Oh, you're dead now Lois.  Jesus is gonna kill ya.
And then we gonna bury you in the yard, next to Kathy Irel ...
Look Peter, I thought it might interest you to know that I'm Jewish
Prove it! What's a nine percent tip on a $200 bill?
In fact, the Last Supper, one of the most iconic image of the
And if I'm not mistaken, Islam is also in that same spiritual family
The most important thing is to treat other people the same way you would want to be treated.
I was scared because my dad convinced me I was going to hell.
And I was doing it to make up for my mother's mistake.
Look, I don't know if being Jewish is the right thing for our family
I just want the chance to explore it so I can know for sure.
But to tell you the truth, I thought we were fine before.
* is violence in movies and sex on tv *
* lucky there's a man who positively can do *
Ah, the hell with you. I'll use the other bathroom.
I hope my son is having a better time with your family.
I will be taking all of my movements there from now on.
* turn the music up, don't you hear that sound? *
Hey, hey, hey, no, no, no! What are you doing?!
Almost all of 'em. Boy, I sure would love it if you guys would come
Than when we had that victorian girl ghost over for dinner.
Maybe I say a few things here, maybe I get a few laughs.
Maybe you guys put me in one of your pictures.
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? That's not funny.
Gee, I wonder if there's anyone else at this table
See, if you had said something like, oh, it's half past a freckle.
Oh, you know, I'm thinking of the three of you.
Well, mr. Griffin, this has been a lot of fun.
A lot of fun. But we gotta get back over to our place
Mm-hmm. And, uh, kinda do, uh... What do we have to do?
Hey, stewie, can I talk to you for a sec?
What do we do? won't you gentleman have a pepsi?
Oh, my god! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!
What do you mean you guys work for the government?
That no one would ever think to utter. What is it?
The phrase is, gosh, that italian family at the next table
Well, look, we'd be happy to help in any way we can.
(normal voice): I'm john wayne at the first thanksgiving, pilgrims.
And I'm your friend and I'll be honest with you--
Show 'em that we know comedy better than they do.
Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, mayor west.
Now you say this spy is located somewhere in quahog?
That's right. We need you to set up some roadblocks
And discover his identity is by saying the phrase, gosh, that italian family at the next table sure is quiet.
I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing.
Okay, so we gotta come up with a name for our improv group.
No, no, you can't just jam jokes in for no reason.
What the hell you being so friggin' comedy hitler about?
I was in improvidence, I was in the wackadamia nuts
That I am the only experienced member of this group.
I can already tell this is not going to be fun.
I mean, granted, you do think of bears on unicycles
Here are the american spies we captured, mr. Prime minister.
I know why you are here, and I mean to help you.
The truth is, the reactivation of a cold war sleeper spy
Wow, thank you so much for your help, mr. Putin.
Okay, this is a warm-up exercise called one word story.
And then you each continue with one word at a time.
I got a good idea where to go with it.
But then when he goes home, his own life's sad,
Mayor west is located one-third of a kilometer that way.
I didn't just bite into a york peppermint patty, did I?
What the-- peter, you're not supposed to be in the audience!
I want to dress up like a clown and have sex with children
Okay, this is not something that should ever have been attempted.
I wish there was some way I could have prevented this.
You may get a call asking you to evaluate my performance.
Can I count on you to give me a ten?
Why are they selling all those dvds so cheap ?
I have high hopes for this. I had a Clif Bar before we started.
All right, everyone, all dvds are a dollar, and everything must go !
The joke, of course, being that one wouldn't generally do that were there a pillow available.
Great, and as a bonus, I'll throw in what dreams may come with robin Williams.
If that dvds even touches road house,i will kill you.
Someday someone will come and take you home for their very own.
Maybe far away or maybe real nearby he may be pouring her coffee she may be straightening his tie.
These drunk, redneck truckers are trying to have their way with me !
Not while my scrotum is pressed up against my stomach in these jeans, they won't.
The only message in that movie is that every problem in life can be solved by kicking.
That's not even the same... Oh ! What the hell ?!
Not gonna talk to me like that in my bar.
Okay, that is the last time you are gonna pull that crap.
Now, you are gonna hold down that football until Charlie Brown kicks it.
And you know what else ? I did some checking around.
What do you say we horse around a little, huh ?
For god's sakes, if you're gonna do that, at least aim for my breasts.
I don't think you should be driving with your feet.
Wait. Why you taking the back way home ? There are so many turns.
Road hou... Roa... Road... road hou... Roa... Roa... road hou... Road hou... Road... roa... Road... road house.
But, uh, you know, I sort of have one other problem.
I have a dinner reservation for two tonight at Dominick's,
Ma'am, you want me to kick those dents out for you ?
Oh, yeah ? I think my scary, otherworldly, shadowy, spirit friends might have something to say about that.
You must be the one she had that fender bender with.
I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer to think of it as a happy accident. Is she ready ?
Unfortunately, she left for dinner with another guy about half an hour ago.
Guys ask her out all the time, and I-I think she loses track.
Let me at least leave my car insurance information for her.
No ! I... I mean, I mean, I wasn't gonna use that on your daughter.
I wouldn't... I would not... I would not use a condom on your daughter.
I mean, I-i-I would, if I was having sex with her, which obviously, I would not do.
But If I mean... I'm safe and all, I get an aids test once every three months.
You know, it's not because I have a lot of sex.
I just eat a lot of poo off the street.
Come to think of it, how did this get in my wallet in the first place ? Dear Brian, somewhere between the point when you're excited enough to want it and too excited to care, think about your future.
I think I've been humiliated enough for one evening. Sorry to bother you.
If it's any consolation, I would never have stood you up.
Well, I guess that makes you one of the rare ones nowadays.
Hey, maybe I'll get to use this after all, huh ?
At my age, I don't have to worry about pregnancy.
Hang on. Just let me get my purse, and we can go.
We're getting along better than Whitney Houston and bobby brown.
Oh, no, thanks. Rita and I grabbed a bite already.
Gosh, you've been seeing this Rita for weeks now, and you still haven't brought her over to the house.
When are we gonna meet the lovely lady, huh ?
What are you saying, I don't date lovely women ?
No, it just seems like some of your past girlfriends have been a little dumb and trampy.
First of all, that's not true, and second of all, she's not like that. She's wonderful, she's smart, she's pretty.
The only reason I haven't brought her around is that you guys don't always make the best impression with girls I date.
Hey, aren't you that chick from the bathroom door ?
Come on, peter. She doesn't want to talk about work.
I assume it's like how it is in the men's room.
Oh, there's a long trough with a big poo in it ?
You know, Brian, the past few weeks have been great.
I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun dating somebody.
I can remember the last time I have : never.
Did you always know that's what you wanted to do ?
Well, actually, I really thought I was going to be an actor at one point.
Oh, you ever heard of a tiny, little independent movie called die hard ?
What do you say we go back to my place and I'll show it to you ?
Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the street, Al.
We've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after their release, and even corresponded with them in prison.
Well, I had no idea I was dating a famous actor.
Perfect, everyone hits it off. Listen, why don't you wait in the car,
Oh, my god ! Peter, did you see her ?
I'm looking at her now ! I can see her from the window up here !
Son of a bitch. Damn it, Chris, I called that from upstairs !
What are you guys talking about ? She's a beautiful woman.
I mean, all the crap I take for dating young bimbos.
Wha-what difference does it make ? Age has nothing to do with anything.
Okay, you know what ? I'll bring her to dinner, and you can see for yourself what a bright, fun, and charming woman she is.
Well, Rita, I'm so glad you could join us for dinner.
Oh, thank you. I'm so glad you can taste it.
You know what we haven't done for a while ? Go around the table, and everybody says what year they were born.
We got a new pencil sharpener in math class !
Say, Rita, who was president when you were born ?
Would you like me to cut yours up a little smaller ?
Boy, speaking of that, I don't know how many people have asked me today where I was when Martin Luther King was shot.
I'm sure you've been asked. What do you tell them ?
Crying like a baby, or crying like someone in college ?
Say, Brian, on her answering machine, how long after her message is the beep ?
Interesting. You know, the first time I had dessert was 36 years ago today.
How about you, Rita, you remember your first dessert ?
How old are you ?! How old are you ?!
Nobody bats an eye if a woman dates an older man, but god forbid it's the other way around !
She's beautiful, she's a charming woman, and I love her !
They're right, I'm just an old fool thinking we could be together.
Will you stop that ? They're insane. They don't know what they're talking about.
The only thing that matters is how I feel about you.
I think you're the most wonderful woman I've ever met.
Look, if my happiness means so little to you all that you have
Charlotte Rae just standing by to crack a joke, then you really disappoint me.
And if this is what you want, we as a family, support your decision.
I don't. I'd-I'd rather you marry a- a-a-a-a-a-a... A japanese or something.
In 20 years, she'll be 70, and you'll have been dead for 15 years.
Isn't there an early bird special you should be running off to ?
Well, if we get there by 5 : 30, I'm sure they'll honor it.
So, what are you doing this afternoon ? Oh, I'm just sorting out my pills for the week, sweetie. well, you do that, and I'll be over a little later.
Was she sorting out her pills for the week ?
In that little plastic thing with the seven boxes ? Hmm ?
Actually, she just got back from the gym, and she's jumping in the shower.
Have archaeologists ever discovered ancient egyptian pottery in her vagina ?
You know what ? That one was too wordy. That one was too wordy.
It wasn't funny, and we'll work on it and get back to you.
Oh, I've never noticed this picture before. Is that you when you were a little girl ?
Oh, yeah. That's the summer my family went to DC.
What do you say we make a little whoopee ?
You're okay ? I'm not hurting you, am i ?
When I'm on my back, sometimes my breast can slide in my armpit.
It says, Murray Hill, four, one, eight, five. that's not enough numbers ! That's the number, Brian !
Well, how did she break it ? Did she fall ?
Boy, you know, Brian, a woman her age comes in here, they don't always leave.
Listen, Brian, you say the word and I'll go in there with a pillow and you won't have any more problems.
How many times do I have to tell you, I'm sticking by this woman ?
You know, they warned me these blue ones were going to make me constipated.
Oh, and-and if you're going out, get some milk of magnesia.
Huh ? It's like the Internet made out of a tree.
Oh. Weird. You want to have sex in the bathroom ?
Oh, gosh, what a treat. Yes. Yes, I-I would- I would like that.
I know, I feel awful. It was a terrible thing to do.
You see, these past few weeks I've been doubting whether we're compatible, you know, because of the age difference. But I realized that that doesn't matter.
That what-what I get from you is what I always wanted : a smart, sexy, real person who I can talk with and share every piece of me with.
I had a moment of weakness today, but in a way, it's all right because it's taken me to a place where I now realize that you're not too old for me.
You can rationalize it any way you want, but to me, all that shows is that you're an immature guy who doesn't realize what a catch I am.
No, does that look like a divan to you ?
Â¶ is violence in movies and sex on tv Â¶

Uh, chris, I've got to tell you, that sounds worse
Going to go to the cinnabon that has the cage
To the stereo store next to the dead fountain with garbage in it.
Let's say we meet back here under the glue outline
Oh, for god's sake, chris, you're in high school now.
We'll put you in the '80s. You'll pass for hot.
The miley cyrus tour is coming to the quahog civic center
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
I need hannah montana tickets and I need them now!
Never mind who this is! Can you get them or not?
I mean, look how stupid she is with her clothes
Brian, it's my favorite show! It's my favorite show ever!
It's a stupid show and a huge waste of time.
And this is the only time she's gonna be in town
I set up a video camera last night so I can prove
To mom and dad that the evil monkey is real,
Oh, my god! I thought I was the only one.
Chris, I think we should give him a chance to explain himself.
You see, basically, I got home from work one day,
And found my wife cheating on me with another monkey.
All my money was gone, which means I lost the house.
He's just a poor fellow who's down on his luck.
He doesn't hide in your closet making a scary face!
But this is a great chance for us to start over.
You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me!
Oh, my god, miley! I love you! I love you!
H-he's just a baby and he's your biggest fan and...
The size of a football. I think I can see it.
I mean, sarah silverman is just one of the most
Well, I'm glad you guys are having such a great time
Dad, I thought you were going to help me with my book report.
And I just fed him a whole bag of subway sandwiches.
In a couple hours, we are going to sit around
Now, you are welcome to be a part of that.
I've been listening to you talk in your sleep for years,
So I just put your thoughts on paper, that's all.
Wow, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Ah, I'd get up to hug you, but sittin' down's

You drove all the way up to fatherson for a barbecue?
No, dad, it was a barbecue for fathers and sons.
But the monkey's been taking me to all the fun places I like,
How did the monkey know you needed help with algebra?
You are the worst dad in the world and I hate you!
I left my cell phone up at that monkey/kid barbecue.
Lois, could you ask chris to pass the maple syrup?
I ever planted the seed version of him in your vagina?
This is no way for a father and son to act.
You're supposed to love me and all you do is hurt me.
That I welcome them to be gay with me, too.
Chris is going to be so gay by the end of this.
What's this? put your head between these two restrained logs
I've got to go put on my face for press interviews.
Stewie, can you hand me my cell phone? Oh, sure.
Do you think we should tell someone or do something?
She dances like a real girl. She moves like a real girl.
Do you think she does other stuff like a real girl?
And I'll invite chris, and we'll see what we can do.
Well, it's only because you never have any time for me!
Ms. Cyrus, I ask you to stop what you're doing.
You made me realize how much chris really means to me
And how I should always remember not to take him for granted.
I think that time of my life is over, chris.

Pretty good. Just clearing some of my stuff out of the basement.
It's amazing what you find when you clean your basement.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go do some skywriting.
Wow, the best of the world's wildest police chases. and it even has the one with the Flintstones !
Now the driver can add attempted battery to the charges.
The driver turns right into the parking lot of a drive-in movie theater.
At this point, the dinosaur in the back seat Pokes his head up through the roof
And the driver places two small children on top of it.
The driver totals the car and makes a run for it,
I think I might wanna buy this ham radio off ya.
Peter, you been fiddling with that ham radio for seven weeks.
I can barely get any reception on this stupid thing.
So far the only station that comes in is some british guys reading news from places I'm not sure exist.
Today, in Kuzikistan, a peaceful demonstration turned to bloodshed as members of the turzirly tribe flooded Kenpao square in remembrance of the third anniversary of the Hormsburg massacre.
But finally, some good news out of neighboring Kanduzi, as locals there have reached an uneasy alliance with the bordering Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal.
You know, dad, I saw that movie White Noise, and they said you can use empty radio static to talk to dead people.
The guy that used to bang that 70-pound witch ?
Hey, quagmire, guess who I'm talking to right now ?
Brian, will you take me down to baby gap ?
You want me to move it to another day ?
My schedule's been so packed. I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass stuff.
So I bred out some of the intelligence. Made him sort of a simpleton.
Would you like to meet him ? Would you like to meet bitch Stewie ?
Bitch Stewie ! Come here and meet my friend, brain.
Hey, there, Stewie. Oh, what's that ? You got a friend ?
And all I have to feed him is a crude peanut paste.
It's not much, but it's healthier than what people ate in the 50's.
What do I look like ? A Mary ? Yes, I want cigarettes !
Let's have a big karaoke welcome for Peter and Ron !
Hey, Brian ! I sure did enjoy talking to you the other day !
I'm just making sure Stewie is nice and clean for his trip to the playground this afternoon.
We had a little bit of a problem earlier because bitch Stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he ?
I did some poos. I did some poos. I didn't mean to.
This is really weird. I mean, it's... one thing to have him help you out with a busy schedule.
I told him I did the poos even though you did the poos, Stewie.
And what a lot of people don't know is that I was Jane Wyman's first.
The ghost of Reagan is gonna be the new fourth guy in our group.
I'm all for that. What other stories you got, Reagan ?
That's right. And you know who else does impressions ?
In fact, you ought to go see his show at the Mohegan sun casino
Next Saturday at 3 : 00 pm and 5 : 00 pm.
The kids say you gotta go viral to promote yourself these days.
I'm here to get my money back for that ham radio.
Whoa, whoa... slow down there, partner. All sales are final.
Yeah, but you were Agamemnon with me during the sale.
I just saw that word somewhere. I wanted to use it.
Look, peter, why don't you just go home before you get hurt ?
Well, I'm clearly not the only one who was dissatisfied with his purchase.
Whoever bought that baby from you obviously didn't want it.
Wh-what am I supposed to do ? I-I don't want a baby.
Somebody's gotta take this kid off my hands. I-I can't be a father.
Now, I brought you a basket of things to get you started.
Now, if you have any questions, we're right across the street.
Not really sure what I'm supposed to do with you.
Uh, if you ever come home and there's a tie on the door,
It means I'm frogging someone, So give me at least... a couple hours.
I thought you were going to bobby Stalling's birthday party.
Ugh, I hate that kid. And I hate children's birthday parties.
You know, I've never seen Stewie come out of his shell so much.
Somebody else will come along and get it right !
And gosh, bobby, I'd love to play with some of your birthday toys,
But only after you've played with them and only if you say it's okay !
I... don't suppose you'd consider making one of those for me, would you ?
Maybe. What would you be willing to do for me ?
Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail.
Lightly grip the base of your tail with your index finger and your thumb
And then slide your fingers up the length of your tail to the tip.
That's kind of weird. Is this some kind of sexual thing ?
Nobody said anything about sexual. There's nothing sexual about it.
Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail and run your fingers along the length of your tail.
Nobody used that word. This is not a stroking motion.
This is a completely nonsexual thing I am asking you to do in a completely nonsexual way.
Squeeze the base of the tail lightly with your thumb and index finger and then, while continuing to squeeze, run them up the length of your tail to the tip and I'll make you a clone.
I don't know why you're stopping. Nobody told you to stop.
Your lips look a little dry. Why don't you wet'em a little bit ?
Yeah, I named her Anna lee, but I'm probably going to call her Annal for short.
Anyway, thanks for all the baby stuff. What's that big tarp over there ?
Oh, that was Chris's blankie from when he was a baby.
It's true. I never mentioned this because I don't want him to feel bad, but after he was born, they had to rearrange most of my organs.
Oh, yeah. He dragged half of Lois right out with him.
Yeah, the doctors said I'll be lucky if I live past 50 but,
Am I ever ? I've got a to-do list three pages long for him.
Okay, now I want to qualify this by reminding you, as with my clone, the intelligence level is reduced a bit.
Yeah, well, I might have dialed yours back a little more than I ought to have.
Hi, Brian. You got some stuff you want me to do for you ?
I didn't really want to do the work, so bitch Stewie sort of did it.
Will you please help me ? But I'm good at other stuff !
Damn kid's kept me up every night for two weeks.
I've never had sex before and I probably wouldn't have been much good at it.
Hey, there's another note. Glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom, jer...
So, it's just not working out, me being a father and that's why I'm wondering if you and Lois would be willing to adopt the baby.
Uh... Oh, boy, quagmire. I-I don't know that we can do that.
We can barely take care of the two we have.
Just throwing it out there. Have you considered abortion ?
Oh, don't let the press put the scare into you.
I'm going to go ahead and move the conversation forward.
Is there any way you guys could take Anna lee ?
All right, quagmire, just so you're clear on the law,
Once you give this child up to the adoption agency,
Hello, sir. Do you wish to put this child up for adoption ?
She, uh... She'll go to a good home, right ?
Like, you're not going to put her with sand people, right ?
You mean like from star wars ? no, no, no, no, no.
Brian, I didn't know if you wanted a god's eye, but I made you one.
Oh ! Oh, g... Stewie, what is happening to this thing ?!
Oh, yeah. Turns out the clones aren't too stable, Brian.
Yeah, I figure they've got less than a minute before they dissolve completely.
He took my dry cleaning and I have no idea what he did with the ticket.
I'm not proud of this, but I need to lick that up.
I'll tell ya, my life was so dominated by that baby.
Sometimes, you just got to make a decision and go with it.
Like when I decided to try that radical penis enlargement.
You know that would never work again in a million years.
And that stripper only has one tooth, just like Anna lee.
He'll be fine. We shouldn't let this ruin our night.
I just hate the way that one gets so into her work.
Well, it's just me and my old nemesis, first step.
It's a nice family and the kid will be better off here !
You know, it's not a bad way to go !
Yeah, for the money ! You ready to go, quagmire ?
You know, I got to tell you, I think you did a good thing.
Well, I guess I just realized it's not about me.
Thanks, man. Hey, who knows ? Maybe I'll bump into her in 18 years.
¶ is violence in movies and sex on tv ¶
¶ lucky there's a man who positively can do ¶
Just clearing some of my stuff out of the basement.
It's amazing what you find when you clean your basement.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go do some skywriting.
(gasps) and it even has the one with the flintstones!
And the driver places two small children on top of it.
The driver totals the car and makes a run for it,
Hey, quagmire, I think I might wanna buy this ham radio off ya.
Peter, you been fiddling with that ham radio for seven weeks.
I can barely get any reception on this stupid thing.
So far the only station that comes in is some british guys
Oh, yeah, well, you know, I've been so damn busy lately,
I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy
So he's an exact copy of you? Well, not exact.
Oh, I'm always happy to meet one of your friends.
How do you do? Pleased to meet you. I'm bitch stewie.
And all I have to feed him is a crude peanut paste.
Let's have a big karaoke welcome for peter and ron!
¶ oh, honey, when I knock on your door ¶
I sure did enjoy talking to you the other day!
Because bitch stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he?
I mean, it's one thing to have him help you out
The ghost of reagan is gonna be the new fourth guy in our group.
(imitating ed sullivan): Hey, ron, tonight we got a really big show.
In fact, you ought to go see his show at the mohegan sun casino
The kids say you gotta go viral to promote yourself these days.
I'm here to get my money back for that ham radio.
Yeah, but you were agamemnon with me during the sale.
I just saw that word somewhere. I wanted to use it.
Look, peter, why don't you just go home before you get hurt?

But I'm probably just going to call her annal for short.
Oh, that was chris's blankie from when he was a baby.
I never mentioned this because I don't want him to feel bad,
But after he was born, they had to rearrange most of my organs.
Oh, yeah. He dragged half of lois right out with him.
Yeah, the doctors said I'll be lucky if I live past 50,
But chris is healthy, and I thank god for that.
I've got a to-do list three pages long for him.
Okay, now I want to qualify this by reminding you
Hi, brian. You got some stuff you want me to do for you?
Damn kid's kept me up every night for two weeks.
And I probably wouldn't have been much good at it.
Hey, there's another note. glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom, jer...

Pretty good. Just clearing some of my stuff out of the basement.
It's amazing what you find when you clean your basement.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go do some skywriting.
Wow, the best of the world's wildest police chases. and it even has the one with the Flintstones !
Now the driver can add attempted battery to the charges.
The driver turns right into the parking lot of a drive-in movie theater.
At this point, the dinosaur in the back seat Pokes his head up through the roof
And the driver places two small children on top of it.
The driver totals the car and makes a run for it,
I think I might wanna buy this ham radio off ya.
Peter, you been fiddling with that ham radio for seven weeks.
I can barely get any reception on this stupid thing.
So far the only station that comes in is some british guys reading news from places I'm not sure exist.
Today, in Kuzikistan, a peaceful demonstration turned to bloodshed as members of the turzirly tribe flooded Kenpao square in remembrance of the third anniversary of the Hormsburg massacre.
But finally, some good news out of neighboring Kanduzi, as locals there have reached an uneasy alliance with the bordering Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal.
You know, dad, I saw that movie White Noise, and they said you can use empty radio static to talk to dead people.
The guy that used to bang that 70-pound witch ?
Hey, quagmire, guess who I'm talking to right now ?
Brian, will you take me down to baby gap ?
You want me to move it to another day ?
My schedule's been so packed. I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass stuff.
So I bred out some of the intelligence. Made him sort of a simpleton.
Would you like to meet him ? Would you like to meet bitch Stewie ?
Bitch Stewie ! Come here and meet my friend, brain.
Hey, there, Stewie. Oh, what's that ? You got a friend ?
And all I have to feed him is a crude peanut paste.
It's not much, but it's healthier than what people ate in the 50's.
What do I look like ? A Mary ? Yes, I want cigarettes !
Let's have a big karaoke welcome for Peter and Ron !
Hey, Brian ! I sure did enjoy talking to you the other day !
I'm just making sure Stewie is nice and clean for his trip to the playground this afternoon.
We had a little bit of a problem earlier because bitch Stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he ?
I did some poos. I did some poos. I didn't mean to.
This is really weird. I mean, it's... one thing to have him help you out with a busy schedule.
I told him I did the poos even though you did the poos, Stewie.
And what a lot of people don't know is that I was Jane Wyman's first.
The ghost of Reagan is gonna be the new fourth guy in our group.
I'm all for that. What other stories you got, Reagan ?
That's right. And you know who else does impressions ?
In fact, you ought to go see his show at the Mohegan sun casino
Next Saturday at 3 : 00 pm and 5 : 00 pm.
The kids say you gotta go viral to promote yourself these days.
I'm here to get my money back for that ham radio.

All your favorite, once acceptable hits like drunk old injun.

¶ pew, stinky frenchman, frog you. ¶ hey there, fruity.
You know, without the other guy yappin' in my ear,
Now I know you're interested in being the fourth guy
Think you're a little small? Listen, I tell you what.
You can be in our group if I can have some of your cereal.
I-I don't get it. Why, why wouldn't quagmire like me?
I guess I don't have a new sweater and a haircut.
Oh, we'd love to, horace, but there's only three of us.
What do you say we hit another bar, keep it goin'?
I can't. There's a girl tied up in my basement who needs some food.
It has been two months since I made the tragic choice
The only food I have is the rest of this
Keeps bringing me back to the top of the mountain.
If anyone finds this, tell my family I love them. ...Of being on a frozen mountaintop!
Hey, lois. I'd like you to meet our new friend...
Sorry, I was out of it. Wait, are we being robbed?
I hope this doesn't make you feel awkward, my man.
We should grab a coffee or something and catch up.
You're not really gonna hang out with him, lois, are ya?
Well, you datin' that guy? It's just a lot to take in.
I mean, jerome and I dated over 12 inches ago.
Get him out of my life is more like it.
Really? But I thought my knocking on the tv glass
Distracted him, and that's what made him fall down that hill.
And from the looks of it, she likes it rough.
The last thing she'd want right now is to be objectified.
I got a deaf brother, you want to make fun of him, too?
Quagmire & jerome: Leg her down and smack 'em yak 'em!
I mean, how do we know we can really trust him?
Yeah, why the hell wouldn't we be able to trust him?
Alex keaton (on tv): Listen, I don't care that you're dating mallory.
And get in a van and shoot people in the d.C. Area.
Yeah, well, when I find the guy who did it,
I'm gonna rip his arms off and do his wife in front of him.
Man, I'm so lucky to have real friends like you and peter.
Well, well, I guess we're just gonna have to wait.
So how long is jerome gonna be staying with us, dad?
I don't know, chris, but the sooner he's out of here, the better.
Well, it sounded like... I know, I know, but it's fine.
You saved my life! um, I'll have what she's having,
He thinks he's going on a date with an old girlfriend.
I wrote you that, because I knew you'd never come if it was me.
But I planned a big night and we're gonna have a great time.
To fill the hole she made when she walked out.
Than lewis and clark and the guy who likes to rip up maps.
Oh, and this is peter and I at our wedding.
Oh, surely, jerome, you don't want to stay in the same house
I know you want my wife, but you can't have her!
I'd never do anything to hurt you or your family.
Hey, what if I just drank this whole bottle of ketchup?
Not so great. The economy's sort of taken its toll,
I mean, you want to learn more, read the papers,
You want me to sit here and explain to you how a plane works?
All I've done is try to be nice to you,
And you still don't like me. How can you not like me?
From certain death, and this is how you repay him?
And to add insult to injury, you defecate all over his yard.
You're this deep guy who loves women for their souls
I don't buy them a copy of catcher in the rye
And that's why you like him so much-- he's you.
She would have known there's no a in the word definite.
Is your textbook liberal agenda, how we should legalize pot, man,
And, by the way, driving a prius doesn't make you jesus christ.
Well, who the hell are you to talk down to anyone?
Which isn't nearly as bad as your failure as a father.
But you know what? I could forgive all of that,
Peter, sometimes you just make me sick to my stomach.
Look, I know you think jerome was a good guy, but...
But, listen, there is something I got to fess up to.
I had myself lots of nasty ass sex with meg.
You only need one person to like you and that person is you.
Why are you getting MapQuest directions to Abigail Breslin's house ?
I just think she's a one-of-a-kind spirit, and I don't want to see her go
down the wrong... What the hell are you doing going through my personal stuff ?
She's fascinated by things that are going in my life, and... Fine, I googled myself, okay ? You got me. But check this out.
and they happen to have chosen to read and discuss my book,
See ? I knew it was just a matter of time
The economy's in the news today, and Congress is considering
Is this the right move during the worst recession since the 1930s ?
Look, if we're gonna get this economy back on track,
we have to get more money in the pockets of--
put more people out of work and make it harder
- How's it going, Kurtwood ?  Good. Thanks for having me.
Quagmire, it's so awesome that you could come over after work today.
I know. I'm so psyched. Hey, let's make some Kool-Aid !
No, we got to wait for Lois to do it.
Peter, you come out here right now and clean up this mess !
No ! You said I could have two friends over.
So I only had one friend over, and it was just me and quagmire,
And I said we could make Kool-Aid instead of the other friend !
Bonnie's way cooler than you ! Joe has computer games !
Peter, it took me a half hour to clean up all that Kool-Aid.
I am sick as hell of you constantly making a mess of this house and having to clean up after you.
Are you nuts ? We don't have the money for that.
And what about the Petercopter ? Did we not have money for the Petercopter ?
Did I say anything when you bought that iron ?
Why is she wearing makeup like she's going out ?
Oh, nowhere important. Just this special dinner in my honor.
Oh, I thought someone just asked why they're honoring me.
They loved the book so much, they want to give me their most prestigious award.
It'd be nice to get some support around here !
Yeah, what channel will the awards ceremony be on ?
Are they having an awards ceremony for how well you did the dishes last night ?
Hi there. Uh, you know, I wasn't sure I had the right address.
So, how long have you been a member of the Rhode Island Society For Special Literary Excellence ?
Oh, no, I'm not a member ; I'm their chaperon.
Lois was right. I'm not a writer, I'm a joke.
Every day in the funnies, all you do is judge.
Why don't you shut your *** mouth for once and go home *** *** and your wife in the face !
Oh, please be okay, please be okay, please be okay.
Okay, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna be... Oh, my god !
Oh, my god, yes ! Brian killed a dog !
So, did you hear all that noise last night ?
I swear to god, it sounded like somebody had an accident and maybe somebody got hurt.
Yeah, something must've gone done. The cops were poking around.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's something in the paper about it.
Yes, I'm calling about the ad in the paper ?
You seen my dog ? You callin'about my dog ?
He's all I got, 'cause I'm a young street tough, and my parents ain't so good to me.
Sittin'there with a smile on his face, listenin'to me talk about how daddy beats me something fierce.
Listen, I don't want to point fingers but I'm missing about a thousand dollars in play money.
Hey, Brian, you want to see what I drew in arts and crafts at day care ?
And this one I call alive dog burying dead dog.
Do you have any idea how upset I am about all this ?
How would you feel if you killed a baby ?
Well, I've killed seven, but the point is, you might feel better if you just confess to what you've done.
I can say this in front of all of you.
Then I buried the body and even went out of my way to cover up the evidence.
I know, and that's why I'm prepared for you to arrest me and take me to jail where I belong.
I just couldn't take the stress anymore. I had to come clean. I mean, the truth is, I didn't even stop to find out if he had an owner. I just completely...
Wait, wait, owner ? What are you talking about ?
I just told you. I hit and killed a dog with my car !
Well... I mean, it's not like you killed a person.
An animal killing another animal ? That happens all the time.
I could do it ! I could do it right now !
Nobody would say a thing ! I could blow your brains out
Wasn't she supposed to leave like two hours ago ?
Uh, Consuela ? I thought you finished cleaning hours ago.
You know, Brian, I love it here at the ice cream shop.
If I ever get molested or raped, this is the place I'm gonna think of to make everything all right.
Nothing. I'm just... I'm a little bummed out from the other day.
I just can't believe our society actually values the life of a dog less than that of a human. It's infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark at a tree and chew on your balls for an hour.
That's usually the way I'd Handle this kind of thing, but not this time.
Look at that dog over there. You think he wants to be tied to that chair, waiting in the hot sun while his owner gets ice cream ?
Hell, no ! I am gonna make people see that an animal's life is just as important as a human's !
Meg, will you take one of these and pass it down, please ?
Our first meeting is tomorrow night, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys would come and show your support.
Well, of course we will, Brian. We'd be happy to come.
And then maybe try to merge with one of the larger groups.
Oh, that's a great idea, Brian. Maybe you could join PETA.
No, Peter, I'm just saying, maybe if this meeting goes well,
Somebody better have something to say to me pretty damn soon, or I'm gonna have something to say to them !
That's it. Peter, we have got to get rid of her.
I couldn't agree more. Just let me see if Mikey sells those things with batteries or what the situation is there.
It looks like fun, and I want to do it.
No, I'm doing it. I'm gonna do a big jump-off.
Good evening, everyone. I want to thank you all for joining me at this very important event.
Animals are treated as second-class citizens everywhere throughout this nation.
We kill them for food, we humiliate them as pets, and we use them for medical and cosmetic research.
Everywhere they are crying out in the hopes that someone will hear.
Okay, Barney, I'm going to work now but I'm gonna leave NPR on for you.
Good day to you and welcome to all things considered,
A show where we talk very softly and right into the mic'.
Do you hear that ? I'm whispering right in your ear.
Now underneath each one of your chairs you'll find a pamphlet with a simple list of animal rights do's and don't's.
Wait a minute, I'm not allowed to have steak ?
But how are we supposed to find cures for disease ?
Well, there are many more promising research methods for curing disease than animal testing.
Do you know that in some asian countries they actually cook and eat dogs ?
I would try it... I mean, if everybody else was.
You know what, you know what ? This is driving me crazy. I wanna eat a dog now.
I just never realized how little meaning my life had !
Don't worry, Rupert. I know how to get him out of his funk.
Poor bastard's more upset than I was when I read
Monkeys aren't supposed to drink Chardonnay ! He's tricking you !
Abogados ! Cinco cinco cinco, cinco cinco cinco cinco !
No people were killed, but the burned body of a dog was found inside.
The tag on the collar says he lived here. I'm sorry.
My best friend in the whole world... And he's gone.
You know, Peter, I think he was also my best friend.
I never realized how important I was to this family.
Wait a second. Just to prove a point to me, you burned down a liquor store and murdered a dog ?!
Well, I guess we should tell them the truth now.
Hi, we here at Family Guy want you to know that we respect all living beings and assure you that no animals were harmed in the making of this episode.
Why are you getting MapQuest directions to Abigail Breslin's house ?
I just think she's a one-of-a-kind spirit, and I don't want to see her go
down the wrong... What the hell are you doing going through my personal stuff ?
She's fascinated by things that are going in my life, and... Fine, I googled myself, okay ? You got me. But check this out.
and they happen to have chosen to read and discuss my book,
See ? I knew it was just a matter of time
The economy's in the news today, and Congress is considering
Is this the right move during the worst recession since the 1930s ?
Look, if we're gonna get this economy back on track,
we have to get more money in the pockets of--
put more people out of work and make it harder
- How's it going, Kurtwood ?  Good. Thanks for having me.
Quagmire, it's so awesome that you could come over after work today.
I know. I'm so psyched. Hey, let's make some Kool-Aid !
No, we got to wait for Lois to do it.
Peter, you come out here right now and clean up this mess !
No ! You said I could have two friends over.
So I only had one friend over, and it was just me and quagmire,
And I said we could make Kool-Aid instead of the other friend !
Bonnie's way cooler than you ! Joe has computer games !
Peter, it took me a half hour to clean up all that Kool-Aid.
I am sick as hell of you constantly making a mess of this house and having to clean up after you.
Are you nuts ? We don't have the money for that.
And what about the Petercopter ? Did we not have money for the Petercopter ?
Did I say anything when you bought that iron ?
Why is she wearing makeup like she's going out ?
Oh, nowhere important. Just this special dinner in my honor.
Oh, I thought someone just asked why they're honoring me.
They loved the book so much, they want to give me their most prestigious award.
It'd be nice to get some support around here !
Yeah, what channel will the awards ceremony be on ?
Are they having an awards ceremony for how well you did the dishes last night ?
Hi there. Uh, you know, I wasn't sure I had the right address.
So, how long have you been a member of the Rhode Island Society For Special Literary Excellence ?
Oh, no, I'm not a member ; I'm their chaperon.
Lois was right. I'm not a writer, I'm a joke.
Every day in the funnies, all you do is judge.
Why don't you shut your *** mouth for once and go home *** *** and your wife in the face !
Oh, please be okay, please be okay, please be okay.
Okay, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna be... Oh, my god !
Oh, my god, yes ! Brian killed a dog !
So, did you hear all that noise last night ?
I swear to god, it sounded like somebody had an accident and maybe somebody got hurt.
Yeah, something must've gone done. The cops were poking around.
I wouldn't be surprised if there's something in the paper about it.
Yes, I'm calling about the ad in the paper ?
You seen my dog ? You callin'about my dog ?
He's all I got, 'cause I'm a young street tough, and my parents ain't so good to me.
Sittin'there with a smile on his face, listenin'to me talk about how daddy beats me something fierce.
Listen, I don't want to point fingers but I'm missing about a thousand dollars in play money.
Hey, Brian, you want to see what I drew in arts and crafts at day care ?
And this one I call alive dog burying dead dog.
Do you have any idea how upset I am about all this ?
How would you feel if you killed a baby ?
Well, I've killed seven, but the point is, you might feel better if you just confess to what you've done.
I can say this in front of all of you.
Then I buried the body and even went out of my way to cover up the evidence.
I know, and that's why I'm prepared for you to arrest me and take me to jail where I belong.
I just couldn't take the stress anymore. I had to come clean. I mean, the truth is, I didn't even stop to find out if he had an owner. I just completely...
Wait, wait, owner ? What are you talking about ?
I just told you. I hit and killed a dog with my car !
Well... I mean, it's not like you killed a person.
An animal killing another animal ? That happens all the time.
I could do it ! I could do it right now !
Nobody would say a thing ! I could blow your brains out
Wasn't she supposed to leave like two hours ago ?
Uh, Consuela ? I thought you finished cleaning hours ago.
You know, Brian, I love it here at the ice cream shop.
If I ever get molested or raped, this is the place I'm gonna think of to make everything all right.
Nothing. I'm just... I'm a little bummed out from the other day.
I just can't believe our society actually values the life of a dog less than that of a human. It's infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark at a tree and chew on your balls for an hour.
That's usually the way I'd Handle this kind of thing, but not this time.
Look at that dog over there. You think he wants to be tied to that chair, waiting in the hot sun while his owner gets ice cream ?
Hell, no ! I am gonna make people see that an animal's life is just as important as a human's !
Meg, will you take one of these and pass it down, please ?
Our first meeting is tomorrow night, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys would come and show your support.
Well, of course we will, Brian. We'd be happy to come.
And then maybe try to merge with one of the larger groups.
Oh, that's a great idea, Brian. Maybe you could join PETA.
No, Peter, I'm just saying, maybe if this meeting goes well,
Somebody better have something to say to me pretty damn soon, or I'm gonna have something to say to them !
That's it. Peter, we have got to get rid of her.
I couldn't agree more. Just let me see if Mikey sells those things with batteries or what the situation is there.
It looks like fun, and I want to do it.
No, I'm doing it. I'm gonna do a big jump-off.
Good evening, everyone. I want to thank you all for joining me at this very important event.
Animals are treated as second-class citizens everywhere throughout this nation.
We kill them for food, we humiliate them as pets, and we use them for medical and cosmetic research.
Everywhere they are crying out in the hopes that someone will hear.
Okay, Barney, I'm going to work now but I'm gonna leave NPR on for you.
Good day to you and welcome to all things considered,
A show where we talk very softly and right into the mic'.
Do you hear that ? I'm whispering right in your ear.
Now underneath each one of your chairs you'll find a pamphlet with a simple list of animal rights do's and don't's.

I just never realized how little meaning my life had !
Don't worry, Rupert. I know how to get him out of his funk.
Poor bastard's more upset than I was when I read
Monkeys aren't supposed to drink Chardonnay ! He's tricking you !
Abogados ! Cinco cinco cinco, cinco cinco cinco cinco !
No people were killed, but the burned body of a dog was found inside.
The tag on the collar says he lived here. I'm sorry.

¶ is violence in movies and sex on tv ¶
¶ lucky there's a man who positively can do ¶
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said it was a boat.
I ain't seen that much puke since my bachelor party.
Like, a bachelor party with all your friends? My what?
How would you like to take a half a pound of hamburger
How would you like to take a half pound of hamburger
He's never gonna be quite in step with the rest of us
And this is sort of my way of taking care of him.
Well, that's nice of you, but it was so much simpler
When it was just you and me doing our thing.
Odds are he won't even come back with the actual food.
So what do you think, carter? You having a good time?
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with myself.
No, peter's crippled friend, I think I'm just gonna leave.
Aw, come on, you just gotta relax and cut loose.
Except for the fact we gotta sit next to that woman
You guys are probably gonna be talking about this forever.
Do I, do I stick the money directly inside of her?
And you, give this old bastard the ride of his life.
Oh, dear, I do hope there's something to be done.
What if he's in a coma for, like, 20 years
And he comes out of the coma and you guys are all dead,
But I'm still alive and I'm a famous race car driver,
And I'm so surprised to see him there, I crash,
And I wake up and he's a race car driver.
Stewie, do you want to be a race car driver when you grow up?
Well, gosh, if you think I'd be good at it.
I'd like to talk to you about a few things.
It means they didn't cut the rope when I climaxed.
It means the train wasn't able to push the delorean
Up to 88 miles per hour and I'm still stuck in 1885.
Eaten by sharks while snorkeling Stabbed to death in a toys r us bathroom. ...1940s roller skate left in the hall.
Had a heart attack and have slipped into a coma.
He spent his whole life building it from the ground up.
And you don't know anything about running a big business.
Geez, you're a bigger downer than a german bedtime story.
Over the past year, and our stock is at an all-time high.
I will be running the company from hence here forth.
Now, I want you all to lay some business talk on me.
What can we do to make this quarter more quarterly?
Okay, I can see I'm gonna have to get things rollin'.
All right, we're gonna do an exercise called the idea ball.
And whoever catches it, throw out the first idea you got,
And he throws out an idea and so on. Everybody clear?
You know what I'm hearin', gentlemen? what's the best way to put this?
This isn't the way we're gonna do things under my leadership.
How are you supposed to run that company without them?
You are gonna help me lead this company into the future.
Yes, it has two settings: Barry white and bill cosby.
Well, you see, daddy, when you were in a coma,
Bill cosby heart monitor: Zibida, zoobida, gebada, bopada, zipity, ziggita,
And it's better than it ever was when you were running it.
That fart I have at 3:00-- can you push that up to now?
He's more annoying than when he's making his christmas list.
Now, peter, are you sure this is all you want for christmas?
I'll talk to him as soon as he gets home.
Well, fine, then, have a box of jeremy irons cereal.
If you're looking for a prize at the bottom, there is none.
Peter, all of my father's assets are tied up in that corporation.
Now you are gonna make amends with daddy, and that's final.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, be in my office tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Hmm... I don't know if I like the sound of that laugh.
I knew I didn't like the sound of that laugh.
What gives you the right to treat me like this?
For 20 years, mr. Pewterschmidt, and now I'm the one in charge.
And you have to go cubicle to cubicle inviting people.
Aw, come on, peter, I'm not, I'm not good with rejection.
Hi. I was gonna catch the big bang theory tonight,
And wondered if you wanted to come over and watch.
All right, if you change your mind, here's a flyer.
See, peter, I told you, no one wants to come.
Oh, when I tell that joke at work tomorrow, people...
I pat you on the head and feed you from the hand.
In the employee lounge, and the employees were mad at me
Oh, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
Giving the company back to daddy so you won't get eaten!
I have my husband back, and you have your company.
As I've grown so weary of doing an american accent.
But I sure am gonna miss being a corporate big shot.
Well, you'll always be a big shot in this family, sweetheart.
It sure was nice of you to invite us out on your yacht, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said it was a boat.
Boy, the fish tank at day care really nailed it.
I ain't seen that much puke since my bachelor party.
You dunno what a bachelor party is ?  No !
didn't you have like a bachelor party with all your friends ?
- My what ?  My god, well, we are gonna fix that.
Carter, I am gonna throw you the best bachelor party ever !
- Why would you do that ?  'cause I'm your pal and I want to help. Like cheeseburger helper.
How would you like to take a half a pound of hamburger and make a delicious meal for the whole family ?
How would you like to take a half pound of hamburger and make a delicious meal for the whole family...
I could just take cheese and put it on the thing he's doing.
Look, he's my brother. He didn't get enough oxygen at birth.
He's never gonna be quite in step with the rest of us and this is sort of my way of taking care of him.
Well, that's nice of you, but it was so much simpler when it was just you and me doing our thing.
Odds are he won't even come back with the actual food.
I'm so sorry for your burden. You're a good brother.
So what do you think ? You having a good time ?
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with myself. I'm very uncomfortable.
Why don't you get a lap dance, Mr. Pewterschmidt ?
No, Peter's crippled friend, I think I'm just gonna leave.
Come on, you just gotta relax and cut loose, like those foreign guys over there.
I had many drinks last night and I was so hung out this morning.
Except for the fact we gotta sit next to that woman who came with her co-workers.
Huh, aren't we all pals ? I work at the office.
This is empowering. Maybe I'll get a dance, huh ?
You guys are probably gonna be talking about this forever.
A woman who's so cool with all of this ? Jackpot !
All right, there's a cute-looking one. Excuse me, miss ?
Do I, do I stick the money directly inside of her ?
And you, give this old bastard the ride of his life.
And listening to the sound of your voice, I'd say...
Oh, dear, I do hope there's something to be done.
Dr. House, if you're gonna save this patient, you'll need this.
How are you gonna play by the rules if you don't have the rule boo-- Oh...
Sometimes people fake being in a coma. This man is not.
No, it's been three days and I'm really starting to get worried.
What if he's in a coma for, like, 20 years and he comes out of the coma and you guys are all dead.
But I'm still alive and I'm a famous race car driver, and he's like aw, man, Stewie turned out awesome.
And he comes to one of my races and I'm so surprised to see him there, I crash.
And then I'm in a coma for 20 years, and I wake up and he's a race car driver.
Do you want to be a race car driver when you grow up ?
Well, gosh, if you think I'd be good at it.
I'd like to talk to you about a few things.
He has left video wills, applicable to a wide variety of situations.
It means they didn't cut the rope when I climaxed.
If you're watching this one it means the train wasn't able to push the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour and I'm still stuck in 1885.
Had a heart attack and have slipped into a coma.
I leave control of my company, Pewterschmidt Industries, to my daughter Lois.
I don't know the first thing about running a billion dollar company.
The board of directors is fully prepared to run the company in carter's absence,
Well, now wait a second, Lois. I could run the company.
You know what that is, Lois ? That's you playing by the rule book.
Well, Lois, I'm off to my first day as a corporate bigwig.
I'm not so sure about this, peter. I mean, that's daddy's company.
He spent his whole life building it from the ground up.
And you don't know anything about running a big business.
Geez, you're a bigger downer than a german bedtime story.
Pewterschmidt Industrie's pharmaceutical division is up over 30%, profits in new media have doubled each quarter over the past year and our stock is at an all-time high.
I will be running the company from hence here forth.
Now, I want you all to lay some business talk on me. I need ideas.
What can we do to make this quarter more quarterly ?
Okay, I can see I'm gonna have to get things rollin'.
All right, we're gonna do an exercise called the idea ball.
I'm gonna toss a ball to one of you, and whoever catches it, throw out the first idea you got then pass the ball to the next guy. He throws out an idea and so on.
This isn't the way we're gonna do things under my leadership.
I don't care what Mr. Pewterschmidt would have done. We need to take risks.
There, now that I've got your attention. You're all fired.
Does the name Lacey Chabert mean anything to you ?
Look, peter, all I'm saying is, those guys have been with daddy for years.
How are you supposed to run that company without them ?
That's it, Lois, you're fired. Chris, you are now Meg's mother.
Brian, Quagmire, Mort, you are gonna be my creative team.
You are gonna help me lead this company into the future.
Peter, we don't know anything more than you do about running a company.
Well, we don't need him anyway. This company's gonna make it on my ideas.
Here are the products we'll be unveiling in the new fiscal year.
Well, it's good to see everyone's adapting to their new business roles.
Mr. Quagmire, the Davidson account is waiting for you in the conference room.
What happened to the free-loving Quagmire who was banging ten chicks at a time ?
You had a heart attack, daddy, but you're all right now.
Oh, it's an african american heart monitor made by your company.
Well, you see, daddy, when you were in a coma,
Griffin ! Get the hell out of my building !
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I like being a fat cat.
And it's better than it ever was when you were running it.
This is my company ! Throw that guy out !
Do you know who I am ?! I'm Carter Pewterschmidt !
Don't you dare throw me out of this lobby !
That fart I have at 3 : 00, can you push that up to now ?
Lois, how could you let your idiot husband take over my company ?
He's more annoying than when he's making his christmas list.
Now, Peter, are you sure this is all you want for christmas ?
Oh, that's ridiculous. I'll talk to him as soon as he gets home.
Well, fine, then, have a box of Jeremy Irons cereal.
If you're looking for a prize at the bottom, there is none.
I want you to make things right with daddy. It's his company.
Peter, all of my father's assets are tied up in that corporation.
If you freeze up his money, he's not gonna have anything to live on.
Now you are gonna make amends with daddy, and that's final.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, be in my office tomorrow morning at 9 : 00.
I don't know if I like the sound of that laugh.
I knew I didn't like the sound of that laugh.
What gives you the right to treat me like this ?
You've been treating me like crap For 20 years, Mr. Pewterschmidt, and now I'm the one in charge. Hang on a second.
I command you to have a viewing party for tonight's episode of the big bang theory.
And you have to go cubicle to cubicle inviting people.
Come on, Peter, I'm not, I'm not good with rejection.
Hi. I was gonna catch the big bang theory tonight and wondered if you wanted to come over and watch.
All right, if you change your mind, here's a flyer.
If you do decide to come, I'm just asking that you bring an appetizer.
See, Peter, I told you, no one wants to come. This is awful.
You're not off the hook. You still got to have that party.
I'll have you know that I can bench press over 690 billion nanograms.
Oh, when I'll tell that joke at work tomorrow, people...
Carter, as your boss, I'm ordering you to pay a compliment to this sharply-dressed asian man.
I pat you on the head and feed you from the hand.
And then he made me clean out the fridge in the employee lounge, and the employees were mad at me because I threw out food that they still wanted.
We've got to do something to take him down and get your company back.
In order to oust an idiot, We've got to think like an idiot.
It's just, apparently, somebody flushed a baby swamp monster down the toilet somewhere, not far from here.
What ?! Who would flush a baby swamp monster ?
And now it's grown up and is attacking important businessmen.
It sounds like maybe a swamp monster who needs to project a little more.
Quick, Peter, sign this legal document giving the company back to daddy so you won't get eaten !
I don't understand, but nothing makes sense in these swamp monster times.
I have my husband back, and you have your company.
And if you don't mind, I'll address you in my natural speaking voice, as I've grown so weary of doing an american accent.
Do you want to come to my big bang viewing party next week ?
Well, I'm sorry you lost the company, Peter, but I think it's for the best.
But I sure am gonna miss being a corporate big shot.
Well, you'll always be a big shot in this family, sweetheart.
In that contract you signed, you got to keep the corporate plane.
I-I don't know. A police... A fireman... A scientist !
Both his first and last names are slang for penis.
Family Feud's coming to Quahog ? Peter, we should try out.
I could get that cave for the front yard I've always wanted,
Hey, you kids stay out of that cave ! You don't know what's in there !
Lois was so wrecked, they had to sew her up
and open up a new vagina right next to the first one.
Kinda like when they build a new bridge next to the old bridge, and you're like,
I can't believe I used to use the old one. Looks so unsafe.
All right, enough clowning around. Let's talk turkey. We want to play the Feud.
I haven't heard that much applause since Bob Crane premiered his home movies in my closet.
100 people surveyed, top four answers on the board. Here's the question :
Peter, three answers on the board that can beat that.
Richard, I'm going to go with : fetus in the toilet bowl.
Okay, name something you find in your bathroom. a razor blade and a note ?
All right, Griffins, here's your chance to win the game !
Richard, my family seems to think money's the way to go.
So I'm gonna go with the flute that Captain Picard played, first in his imagination and then in real life, in the episode
The Inner Light from Star Trek : The Next Generation.
What ?! No, you idiot ! We said money !
Can you believe it ? We're going to the bonus round !
Wait a sec. I said feces. Where's my answer ?
You're just going to pretend I'm not here, huh ?
I just wanted to make sure the meeting is still on for 2 : 30 tomorrow.
Otherwise I gotta go to that Chinese dentist. Get it ? 2 : 30 ?
You son of a bitch, I had a mouth full of coffee.
Oh, I'm sorry. Your time is up, and you didn't score enough points. But thank you for playing.
You son of a bitch, what about my cave in the yard ?
Peter ! Oh, my God, are you all right ?
His memory could return in days, weeks, years or never.
It's an opportunity to come up with our own names.
All right, Peter, we're going to try to jog your memory with some old videotapes of the family.
Oh, my God, we gotta watch this. Look what they're saying about it. As funny as it is touching !, Gene Shalit. I stood up and cheered. Go, Julia, go !, Joel Siegel. This movie made me laugh so hard I had mild headaches.
So I went to the doctor and got myself checked out.
Everyone seems to love this. We gotta watch it !
I want to show you one of the most special times of your life and mine : our honeymoon.
Get away. I know my body better than you !
You were so handsome and it was such a wonderful week.
You know, this isn't going to be easy, you guys.
We're going to have to re-teach your father everything he's forgotten.
A well, a bird, bird, bird B-bird's the word, a well, a...
You use it to talk to people who aren't in the house.
Yes, there are over six billion people in the world.
I don't think this is the call I was expecting.
You see, this is your fork. And this is a knife.
I want to see more of him, and then suddenly none of him.
All right, you know what ? This is not working.
If you're going to learn to drive, you're going to have to practice first.
Here, play Grand Theft Auto for eight hours, and then we'll give it another try.
So, you guys are my best friends, and this is where we hang out ?
Well, we usually come here, you buy us drinks and tell us what Lois's nipples look like, like you always do.
Yeah, but first, you usually go over there and pull down that blonde waitress's top.
Get nude. Get nude. Please get nude. Please get nude.
Something's happening in my pants. In the front this time.
That's the way it's supposed to be between a husband and wife.
Hey, good-looking, where have you been all my life ?
Morning nice people who I still don't know your names and who mean nothing to me.
And if sex with the rest of you is half as good as it was with her, then I think we're all gonna get along just fine.
Well, no, no, Peter, you can't have sex with the kids.
Well, I wish you'd told him that before he lost his memory.
Geez, you open your mouth for a joke once, and that's what you come up with ?
Get out of the kitchen ! Go on ! Get out ! Out ! Out ! Out !
Out of the kitchen ! Go on ! Get out of here !
You bet. Move over so Tiffany and I have room.
And don't worry about getting me pregnant. I'm already pregnant.
Why the hell would I commit to having sex with one person
Well, if that's how you feel, then, then we no longer have a family.
But this is my house, and I'm not going anywhere.
You don't have to. I'm leaving and I'm taking the kids with me.
Is that what you do with your Saved By the Bell money ?
Mom, I don't want to live in a tiny, gross apartment.
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we don't have a choice.
Your father doesn't remember his life, and he doesn't want us to be a part of it, so we've just got to move on.
A baby doesn't belong in the inner city any more than a baby belongs on a plane.
Well, I'm a bachelor, so I invited a bunch of people over, and now I'm waiting for them to leave. That's what bachelors do.
I'm interested in the redhead with the wooden arms and legs over there.
Don't point at her. Don't point. She's looking. Oh, great. Now I got to go in.
I don't know what I was doing before, but this is the way man was meant to live.
What, that lady and those kids ? I don't even remember'em.
I almost don't want to ask you out because I know you're gonna say no. You want to go out ? No ? Okay.
Oh, hi, Quagmire. What a surprise.  I know, right ?
Gosh, you know, I was just picking up a couple hams to take down to the shelter and here I run into you, buying food to make dinner for your husband.
Oh, it's a long story. You don't want to hear about it.
Oh, shut your face. I want to hear all about it.
But listen, you know, I got all this shopping to do, so...
You want to stop by tomorrow night ? I'll just whip something up.
Holy smokes, this is a sure thing. Like the end of a Mexican wedding.
Crap, we're out of milk. I'm gonna run next door to the airport and get some.
Hey, when you're over there, can you get some rodent traps ?
We got a giant mutant rat living under the sink.
I'm just gonna hide under the sink till y'all go to sleep.
Then I'm gonna come out and make my poops in your Kix.
Is Lois back yet ? I've been trying to get a hold of her.
That was a delicious dinner, Glenn. I didn't know you could cook.
Well, when a fella's been alone as long as I have, he learns to take care of himself.
Well, you're a very sweet friend, and you're so good to listen to my troubles.
Boy, you know, I don't know how a half a glass of wine got me so lightheaded.
No, I think I can make it from here. I...
All right, Peter, now I know your head is still a blank slate, but you got to listen to me when I say... Wait.
Happened yesterday on my way back from the grocery store.
Hey, you just snubbed me in front of my own house.
Look, fella, I don't know who you are and I don't want to, so why don't you just go back to your crabgrass ?
And as I recall, I don't really care for you !
I was just lucky he had an odd number of objects.
Well, I figured I could enjoy the bachelor life for a few more days before getting Lois back.
Lois is on a date with Quagmire, and you've got to stop her
What ?! Oh, my God ! Where is she ?
And you better get there quick, because with Quagmire, sex is inevitable.
Like a fat guy ordering dessert when everyone else wants to leave.
I can't believe we're doing this, but I got to say, it feels kind of right.
I know, it's so weird, right ? I mean, it's... I mean, it's, like, fast.
I mean, it's fast, but it feels, like, okay, you know ?
But if Peter's never coming back to me, it's at least nice to know I'm in the arms of a trusted friend.
I got my memory back, and I love you, Lois. I want you and the kids back.
I treated you so badly, but I hope you know it was only because I wasn't myself.
I didn't just lose my memory. I lost my mind.
I don't care. I'm just overjoyed to have you back !
Both his first and last names are slang for penis.
Family Feud's coming to Quahog ? Peter, we should try out.
I could get that cave for the front yard I've always wanted,
Hey, you kids stay out of that cave ! You don't know what's in there !
Lois was so wrecked, they had to sew her up
and open up a new vagina right next to the first one.
Kinda like when they build a new bridge next to the old bridge, and you're like,
I can't believe I used to use the old one. Looks so unsafe.
All right, enough clowning around. Let's talk turkey. We want to play the Feud.
I haven't heard that much applause since Bob Crane premiered his home movies in my closet.
100 people surveyed, top four answers on the board. Here's the question :
Peter, three answers on the board that can beat that.
Richard, I'm going to go with : fetus in the toilet bowl.
Okay, name something you find in your bathroom. a razor blade and a note ?
All right, Griffins, here's your chance to win the game !
Richard, my family seems to think money's the way to go.
So I'm gonna go with the flute that Captain Picard played, first in his imagination and then in real life, in the episode
The Inner Light from Star Trek : The Next Generation.
What ?! No, you idiot ! We said money !
Can you believe it ? We're going to the bonus round !
Wait a sec. I said feces. Where's my answer ?
You're just going to pretend I'm not here, huh ?
I just wanted to make sure the meeting is still on for 2 : 30 tomorrow.
Otherwise I gotta go to that Chinese dentist. Get it ? 2 : 30 ?
You son of a bitch, I had a mouth full of coffee.
Oh, I'm sorry. Your time is up, and you didn't score enough points. But thank you for playing.
You son of a bitch, what about my cave in the yard ?
Peter ! Oh, my God, are you all right ?
His memory could return in days, weeks, years or never.
It's an opportunity to come up with our own names.
All right, Peter, we're going to try to jog your memory with some old videotapes of the family.
Oh, my God, we gotta watch this. Look what they're saying about it. As funny as it is touching !, Gene Shalit. I stood up and cheered. Go, Julia, go !, Joel Siegel. This movie made me laugh so hard I had mild headaches.
So I went to the doctor and got myself checked out.
Everyone seems to love this. We gotta watch it !
I want to show you one of the most special times of your life and mine : our honeymoon.
Get away. I know my body better than you !
You were so handsome and it was such a wonderful week.
You know, this isn't going to be easy, you guys.
We're going to have to re-teach your father everything he's forgotten.
A well, a bird, bird, bird B-bird's the word, a well, a...
You use it to talk to people who aren't in the house.
Yes, there are over six billion people in the world.
I don't think this is the call I was expecting.
You see, this is your fork. And this is a knife.
I want to see more of him, and then suddenly none of him.
All right, you know what ? This is not working.
If you're going to learn to drive, you're going to have to practice first.
Here, play Grand Theft Auto for eight hours, and then we'll give it another try.
So, you guys are my best friends, and this is where we hang out ?
Well, we usually come here, you buy us drinks and tell us what Lois's nipples look like, like you always do.
Yeah, but first, you usually go over there and pull down that blonde waitress's top.
Get nude. Get nude. Please get nude. Please get nude.
Something's happening in my pants. In the front this time.
That's the way it's supposed to be between a husband and wife.
Hey, good-looking, where have you been all my life ?
Morning nice people who I still don't know your names and who mean nothing to me.
And if sex with the rest of you is half as good as it was with her, then I think we're all gonna get along just fine.
Well, no, no, Peter, you can't have sex with the kids.
Well, I wish you'd told him that before he lost his memory.
Geez, you open your mouth for a joke once, and that's what you come up with ?
Get out of the kitchen ! Go on ! Get out ! Out ! Out ! Out !
Out of the kitchen ! Go on ! Get out of here !
You bet. Move over so Tiffany and I have room.
And don't worry about getting me pregnant. I'm already pregnant.
Why the hell would I commit to having sex with one person
Well, if that's how you feel, then, then we no longer have a family.
But this is my house, and I'm not going anywhere.
You don't have to. I'm leaving and I'm taking the kids with me.
Is that what you do with your Saved By the Bell money ?
Mom, I don't want to live in a tiny, gross apartment.
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but we don't have a choice.
Your father doesn't remember his life, and he doesn't want us to be a part of it, so we've just got to move on.
A baby doesn't belong in the inner city any more than a baby belongs on a plane.
Well, I'm a bachelor, so I invited a bunch of people over, and now I'm waiting for them to leave. That's what bachelors do.
I'm interested in the redhead with the wooden arms and legs over there.
Don't point at her. Don't point. She's looking. Oh, great. Now I got to go in.
I don't know what I was doing before, but this is the way man was meant to live.
What, that lady and those kids ? I don't even remember'em.
I almost don't want to ask you out because I know you're gonna say no. You want to go out ? No ? Okay.
Oh, hi, Quagmire. What a surprise.  I know, right ?
Gosh, you know, I was just picking up a couple hams to take down to the shelter and here I run into you, buying food to make dinner for your husband.
Oh, it's a long story. You don't want to hear about it.
Oh, shut your face. I want to hear all about it.

We now go live to drunk billy in the channel 5 Newscopter.
This just in. Channel 5 Newscopter pilot drunk billy passed away today.
In anticipation of this event, we put together a clip package featuring some of billy's work for channel 5 News. I'm still hungry. said the very hungry caterpillar. But you've already...
But what you shouldn't miss is the quahog rodeo, coming to the civic center this Friday.
And for those of you who are handy with a horse, entry spots are still open.
- Too late, Brian.  Peter, you're gonna enter the rodeo ?
You don't know anything about horses, and you're in terrible shape.
You know, that's the difference between you and me, Lois.
When life comes knocking at the door, You go and hide in the kitchen.
I fling the door wide open and I say, Peter griffin here. What do you got ?
And if that don't convince you, look at this. In this week's TV guide, it says, Peter gets more than he bargained for when he joins the rodeo.
Well, it's in the guide. Hey, can we make that a thing ?
You know what ? I'm not even asking anymore. That's what we're doing.
I got more cowboy blood in me than billy the kid.
Well, he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma and the law just could not seem to track him down and it served his legend well for the folks, they loved to tell about when billy the kid came to town.
All right, Meg, this is only gonna hurt for about three weeks.
Mom, when's it dad's turn ?  I don't know, Chris.
But I think we should all pray for your father
I fell asleep in the car, so now I'm cranky.
This is a disgusting display.  Boy, you can say that again.
Nothing like a bunch of adult men teasing animals for fun.
The only reason I'm here is 'cause my idiot friend is in the rodeo.
One of the competitors is a 13-year-old female riding prodigy.
Apparently she got on the bull to miscarry, and found out she had a talent for it.
Ladies and gentlemen, give an indifferent east coast welcome to the newest bull rider, Peter the Kid !
You know what I am back at the ranch ?
Where you goin', fatty ? We gonna have a party.
Well, gosh, you know, I'm something of a writer myself.
I wrote for The New Yorker for a little while.
I never have to look too far for that. I... What... are you...
Well, we're looking for someone to write a piece on the everyday activities of the average american teenage girl.
It's all ahead of them, you know ? They haven't turned into bitches yet.
Oh, it's true. What happened to all of us ?
I got a house on the cape. Maybe you come visit.
Maybe you call a few days in advance to give me time to get the house clean.
Maybe you bring a blazer, so we can go to a wider range of restaurants.
You see this, Rupert ? Most children build a sand castle.
But I'm building a sand retreat for singles in their 30s.
Hi, I'm a french canadian girl down here on my vacation.
It's a big deal for me to be down here on my own.
I like the swimming pool with a bar in it
'cause you can sit on a barstool and you're in the water.
I like how all the food and drink is included in the price of the ticket.
Yeah, that way you don't have to bring your cash down from the room.
Okay, I was just looking for a friend of mine, so maybe I'll see you later.
You promised yourself you'd talk to somebody and you did it.
I'm writing an article on teenage girls for a magazine.
I'm studying Meg to see what goes on during her day.
So, says here you were involved in the plotting of September 11 ?
You know, just because you're writing a profile on teenage girls, it doesn't mean you have to be a creepy stalker and follow Meg around all day.
Where the hell is she going ? There's nothing out in this part of town.
What is that, Brian ? What is an adult correctional institute ?
It's really good to see you, Meg. It's been a while.
It's just so hard to get over here without anybody finding out.
Have you gotten all the letters and hair that I've sent ?
It's the only thing that's getting me by, Meg. Thank you.
Looks like I'm gonna be in here another three years.
If it takes 10 years or 20 years, I will be here when you get out.
Oh, my god ! Meg's involved with a convict !
Brian, you bastard ! How could you do this to me ?!
He did exactly the right thing by coming to us.
Don't you know what kind of fire you're playing with, dating a prisoner ?
He's all alone in there, and I'm all alone out here.
He's in prison for a reason. He broke the law !
He robbed a convenience store to pay for medication for his mom.
Oh, I'm sure he gave you a very convincing sob story.
We had a pen pal project at school, and when it was over,
Luke and I just kind of kept writing to each other.
Your mother's right, Meg. You got to be careful who you get involved with romantically.
Well, Angela, if I'm really the only guy at work who can solve it, I'll be right there.
I escaped'cause I just couldn't bear another second away from you.
Actually, there was a riot in the prison yard, and I slipped over the fence.
Well, well, quick, get in here before somebody sees you !
Oh, Meg, I've wanted to do that for so long.
And it's nice to be in front of someone for a change.
Hey, Meg ? Can I talk to you for a second ?
Listen, uh, I feel like I should explain myself a little bit here.
I'm sorry I had to tell Lois what was going on. You just...
You gotta realize I was only thinking about your safety and...
Luke ! What the... They let you out of jail ?!
He broke out to see me, Brian. We're in love.
Meg, are you crazy ?! You can't harbor a fugitive. That's a felony.
Are you gonna do it ? Are you gonna tell on me again ?
Brian, will you call me on my mickey mouse phone ?
Wait a second. Why is that guy wearing a prison jumpsuit ?
Sunday, Sunday... Here it is. Peter gets more than he bargains for When he joins the rodeo. Boy, did I. And Meg dates a prison escapee !
First of all, when I was over at your house the other day,
I forgot to tell you how much I like the rearrangement you and bonnie did with your living room furniture.
Second of all, come outside ! There's an escaped convict running across the street !
Well, if you're taking him to jail, you have to take me, too !
Oh, well, that's only fair because after all, I did hide him from the...
Did you also get caught trying to vote in Ohio ?
Well, this is it. Meg gets out of jail today.
Already ? It seems like just yesterday we rented her room to that fly that wants to leave, but can't figure it out.
It's right there ! It's right in front of you !
Whatever it is you're driving at, I'm just apparently not getting it.
I think we should all go together to pick Meg up.
She's probably a little fragile after being in there so long, and I'm sure she'll be heartened to see our faces.
First question : Who's the biggest, toughest guy in this house ?
Well, I don't like to toot my own horn, but I believe I hold the distinction...
For god's sake, dad. Have some humility ! It'll save your life !
Boy, I liked her better when she was more predictable.
I'm a woman in a lab coat wearing goggles, staring intently at a beaker that I'm holding near my face.
I'm a latino in a hardhat, but I'm also wearing a tie so you know I'm a supervisor.
We're college students listening to our professor, but the class is taking place... outside ?!
Meg ! What the hell are you doing in here ?!
Not for... What are you doing with that loofah ?
I'm used to going to the bathroom in my room.
No, you use the toilet here like everyone else !
Well, can you at least empty it each time you use it ?
Oh, my god, are you using my shirts as toilet paper ?
Yeah. And I think I might need some right now.
Oh, my god, that's Meg Griffin ! She just got out of prison !
Hey, Meg, what'd they put you in jail for ?
Did you get your butt hair braided too while you were in there ?
What'd you do, carve a gun out of soap and then not wash with it ? Ha-ha ! P.U.
Meg, are you gonna take those soda cans to the Shawskank Redemption Center ?
Ever since she's gotten out of prison, She is completely out of control.
Don't you see ? That's what the penal system does in this country.
Look at Meg. They took an innocent little girl and turned her into a psychotic, sociopathic freak.
Oh, I... I was just picking up on something Lois said.
What... was it ? What'd you say, Lois ? Something about Meg being a freak ?
Peter said something about Meg which I completely disagree with.
That... That wasn't me. Stewie was really laying into Meg about something.
I'll be outta here by the end of the week.
You're gonna help me get some money so I can get out of this town.
What kind of birdhouse can you build with Popsicles, Roofies, and a mallet ?
Here, here, just take this jar for the leukemia kids.
What happened to the girl we used to know ?
The one he's expecting to see when he steps out of that prison in 40 years ?
I don't care about Luke. I don't need him. I don't need anyone !
Look, if you don't put the gun down, I'm gonna be forced to call the police.
Good ! Call the police ! I want you to !
What do I care if I go back to prison ?
Is it A fistful of backne : Tale of a teenage loser?
This isn't a library, you know. And in the face of every adolescent challenge, she looks at the world through hopeful eyes and maintains an uncommon resilience that can only be admired. In this sense, Meg Griffin is not the typical american girl. She is far sweeter and kinder than that.
Oh, god, that is so nice, Brian. Did you mean all that ?
Oh, my god, I... I can't believe I did this.
I was just so tired of being everyone's whipping girl that it felt kind of good to do some of the whipping.
And what can I do for you four fine black gentlemen today ?
I got to say, Meg, I like you so much better like this.
We now go live to drunk billy in the channel 5 Newscopter.
This just in. Channel 5 Newscopter pilot drunk billy passed away today.

Peter said something about Meg which I completely disagree with.
That... That wasn't me. Stewie was really laying into Meg about something.
I'll be outta here by the end of the week.
You're gonna help me get some money so I can get out of this town.
What kind of birdhouse can you build with Popsicles, Roofies, and a mallet ?
Here, here, just take this jar for the leukemia kids.
What happened to the girl we used to know ?
The one he's expecting to see when he steps out of that prison in 40 years ?
I don't care about Luke. I don't need him. I don't need anyone !
Look, if you don't put the gun down, I'm gonna be forced to call the police.
Good ! Call the police ! I want you to !
What do I care if I go back to prison ?
Is it A fistful of backne : Tale of a teenage loser?
This isn't a library, you know. And in the face of every adolescent challenge, she looks at the world through hopeful eyes and maintains an uncommon resilience that can only be admired. In this sense, Meg Griffin is not the typical american girl. She is far sweeter and kinder than that.
Oh, god, that is so nice, Brian. Did you mean all that ?
Oh, my god, I... I can't believe I did this.
I was just so tired of being everyone's whipping girl that it felt kind of good to do some of the whipping.
And what can I do for you four fine black gentlemen today ?
I got to say, Meg, I like you so much better like this.
¶ is violence in movies and sex on tv ¶

We now go live to drunk billy in the channel 5 newscopter.
Featuring some of billy's work for channel 5 news. I'm still hungry,  said the very hungry caterpillar. but you've already...
And for those of you who are handy with a horse,
Oh, god, this seems like the kind of thing peter...
You know, that's the difference between you and me, lois.
I fling the door wide open and I say, peter griffin here. What do you got?
In this week's tv guide, it says, peter gets more than he bargained for
I got more cowboy blood in me than billy the kid.
¶ well, he robbed his way from utah to oklahoma ¶
¶ and the law just could not seem to track him down ¶
¶ about when billy the kid came to town. ¶
Ho der, ho der, ho der! Ho der, ho der!
Ho der, ho der, ho der. ho der, ho der, ho der.
But I think we should all pray for your father
I fell asleep in the car, so now I'm cranky.
Nothing like a bunch of adult men teasing animals for fun.
Well, gosh, you know, I'm something of a writer myself.
I- I wrote for the new yorker for a little while.
I- I never have to look too far for that.
I got a house on the cape. Maybe you come visit.
So we can go to a wider range of restaurants.
But I'm building a sand retreat for singles in their 30s.
It's a big deal for me to be down here on my own.
I like the swimming pool with a bar in it
'cause you can sit on a barstool and you're in the water.
I like how all the food and drink is included
Okay, I was just looking for a friend of mine,
You promised yourself you'd talk to somebody and you did it.
I'm studying meg to see what goes on during her day.
To be a creepy stalker and follow meg around all day.
Have you gotten all the letters and hair that I've sent?
Looks like I'm gonna be in here another three years.
Oh, I don't expect you to wait for me, meg.
He did exactly the right thing by coming to us.
He's all alone in there, and I'm all alone out here.
Oh, I'm sure he gave you a very convincing sob story.
Luke and I just kind of kept writing to each other.
Well, angela, if I'm really the only guy at work
Oh. I'm still getting used to your sense of humor.
Well, well, quick, get in here before somebody sees you!
Oh, meg, I've wanted to do that for so long.
And it's nice to be in front of someone for a change.
I'm sorry I had to tell lois what was going on.
Luke! What the... ? They let you out of jail?!
He broke out to see me, brian. We're in love.
Brian, will you call me on my mickey mouse phone?
Sunday, Sunday... Here it is. peter gets more than he bargains for
When he joins the rodeo.  boy, did I. and meg dates a prison escapee!
First of all, when I was over at your house the other day,
I forgot to tell you how much I like the rearrangement
Did you also get caught trying to vote in ohio?
Already? It seems like just yesterday we rented her room
To that fly that wants to leave, but can't figure it out.
Just two, same number as you, but I can't, I'm not...
You're right there! ...So I'm just gonna go back upstairs.
I think we should all go together to pick meg up.
She's probably a little fragile after being in there so long,
And I'm sure she'll be heartened to see our faces.
Boy, I liked her better when she was more predictable...
Staring intently at a beaker that I'm holding near my face.
But I'm also wearing a tie so you know I'm a supervisor.
I'm used to going to the bathroom in my room.
Well, can you at least empty it each time you use it?
Oh, my god, are you using my shirts as toilet paper?
Oh, I-I was just picking up on something lois said.
I'll be outta here by the end of the week.
When he steps out of that prison in 40 years?
What do I care if I go back to prison?
Is it a fistful of backne: Tale of a teenage loser?

That it felt kind of good to do some of the whipping.
And what can I do for you four fine black gentlemen today?
I got to say, meg, I like you so much better like this.
It smells so good out here. You see, Peter ?
This is a much better way to spend a Sunday
Chris, I don't think we should be leaving the trail.
I shall put you in a glass box to display on Saint Trimmings Day.
Yes, and to add insult to injury, I shall present to you my fanny :
Chris, did you know your bacne spells Citibank in braille ?
I came to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
You know who that is ? You know who Thornton Mellon...
First, it was Henry David Thoreau. But do you know who Thornton Mellon is ?
This is why the other countries are beating us, you know !
So you know, you got only yourself to blame next time you go to the vet sand complain that that Indian doctor is too rough with your cat.
I'm gonna finally open up to Ellen from my math class and tell her how much I like her.
Our top story : The search for two local boys lost in the woods drags on into its third day.
That's right, Diane. Still no sign of Chris and Stewie Griffin.
Here's the update from the local authorities who are overseeing the search party's efforts.
We're still very optimistic that we're gonna find these kids, and we just want to urge everyone not to give up hope.
We are officially looking for corpses, so let's get back out there, bring back those dead bodies.
Oh, God, this is horrible ! I can't watch anymore !
They scoured the area, and there's no sign of them.
I feel like I can't just sit here doing nothing, but I don't know what I can do.
Daddy, that's not a real person. That's a character on a TV show.
You know, Mom, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about psychics who help find people who are lost.
I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about this fat woman who sat on her dog and it went up inside her guts.
It's been three days, and I just don't know where else to turn.
{Jeffrey ! }Jeffrey, come back. It's gonna get dark soon !
Oh, you're not Jeffrey. You're that missing baby and boy.
Jeffrey ! I found that missing baby and boy !
Oh, I knew they'd find you. I knew you were okay.
Oh, for definite. It's just like a childhood game of Hide and Find !
What do you say for celebration we go dunk our whistles in the trough ?
Oh, but I only have 15 pfenigs on my phone card.
Oh, it is so good to have my boys back home safe and sound.
She said we were gonna find them and we did.
I always wondered about psychics, but I gotta tell ya, I'm a believer now.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and see what else she has to say.
Hey, check it out. Chris and Stewie, you're on the front page of the paper.
You know, Chris, that girl from school sees that picture and you're in.
I think that just might have been cocky forest talk.
No, but you got to take advantage of this. Seize your moment.
Gentlemen, these are all important fundamental rights, but I move we strike the right to bob for small fish with your butt in the air.
Nonsense. You're a hero now. Your picture's in the paper.
She'll be fawning all over you. {Now, }Which one is she ?
That's the way the state of Rhode Island would put it. There's something... up with her, isn't there ?
{Well, }the spacing seems a tad off, but, yeah, individually, they're not awful.
I'm guessing this one owned a bunny, but not anymore.
There's something I've wanted to tell you for a really long time.
And I was wondering if maybe... you want to go out on a date with me.
If that was me... I'm, I'm just saying, if that was me...
Because, if the circumstances were such, as you have described them, but with me in them, that's a very different and scary outcome for those involved.
Estelle, and she told me that Stewie is gonna grow up to be very successful.
She gives me the confidence to live my life knowing I'm making the right choices.
Why would you pay her to hear things you want to hear ?
{Well, }I just think you're being taken for a ride, Lois.
Slow down ! I want to get there, but I want to get there alive !
Mom, why do I have to take a bath with Stewie ?
Because, Meg, Estelle told me that someone in the family was in danger of drowning, and that I should take some steps to prevent it.
I mean, I want to impress her, but what if I mess things up ?
Come on, Chris, it's just a matter of getting off on the right foot.
'Cause there's a lovely lady and she's waiting for you
Before you get to see it there are things you must do
Or a rose that shows that you're a classy fellow
Your finger's up your nose and you are dripping with drool
And you'll see that she will find you so compellin'
And what makes them really nice Is that they've got a little spice
Because they're tighter than a vice and they go on for an hour
Okay, Brian, I'm here. Now, what is it you want ?
All right, look, Lois, this psychic nonsense has gone too far, so I'm going to prove to you that there is no such thing as someone who is psychic, and that with the most minimal training and the right set of buzzwords, anyone can appear to be psychic.
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm psychic, and I'm getting a strong feeling from you.
Do you have a watch or clock that no longer works ?
Just by asking very general questions that would apply to most people, a person can appear to have inside knowledge about you.
Oh, my God. Awesome. Okay, I'm sensing some other bad stuff.
You don't want to hear the truth, don't come to the park.
Maybe I went a little overboard with the things Estelle told me.
All right, look, can we just go home now ?
I am either going to fly or ruin that family's picnic.
Clear your mind, remove all traces of unease and doubt, and I will tell you your future.
You will die in a plane crash and be reincarnated as a prophylactic.
My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska.
Now, get up, come over here, and give me a shoulder massage.
Do it, do it. Come on, do it. Do it, do it.
Oh, my God, this is awful. There's got to be 200 people here.
Ma'am, did you have a female relative who's passed on to the other side named,
I'm sensing a black guy over here. Is there a black guy ?
I'm sensing a doctor in the audience. Where is the doctor ?
{and }she wants to know if this rash looks like it's going to go away.
We just got word of a kidnap victim buried alive with a bomb strapped to his chest.
We need your psychic powers to lead us to him before the bomb goes off.
You came to the right place, Joe. I'll psych that guy out for you.
All right, I mean, it's one thing to take money from a bunch of suckers,
They're about to announce the winning numbers for the Intergalactic Lottery.
Ah, yes ! You're damn right ! Hell, yeah ! You can suck it.
You can suck it. You can suck it. You can all suck it !
Well, Ellen, I had a really interesting time with you tonight.
I need somebody to make me an ice cream sundae, so get in the house.
Uh, unless you're going to pull a sundae out of your belly button,
Did you hear me say put chocolate sauce on there ?
You know, if you want access to this temple, you better pay the proper tribute.
You know, I used to hear that people with down's syndrome were different than the rest of us, but you're not.
You're not different at all. You're just a bunch of like everyone else !
No, you didn't. You made a vow that you were going to ask Ellen out, and you did. That took courage, my friend.
Especially for a poor, timid sap like you. I'm proud of you.
I'm just sorry I never got to make out with her.
She would have crushed your scrote into a diamond with her robot-strength hand.
All right, Peter, we know the victim is somewhere in this area.
Okay, Joe, when I'm tracking someone, it often helps to touch something that belongs to the victim. Does he have a wife ?
It's still very fuzzy. Does he have a daughter ?
Yeah, I see. Does he have maybe, like, a thinner, hotter daughter ?
Okay. Like a... like a young 12 or, like, a she eats a lot of milk products so she got her boobs early 12 ? Which is a real thing, by the way.
I will now use my psychic powers to seek help from beyond.
I shall now channel the ghost of Lou Costello, who will guide us to this soul in distress.
It smells so good out here. You see, Peter ?
This is a much better way to spend a Sunday
Chris, I don't think we should be leaving the trail.
I shall put you in a glass box to display on Saint Trimmings Day.
Yes, and to add insult to injury, I shall present to you my fanny :

You know, }I don't mind so much that you're aging,
It's just the way you're shoving it down my throat.
Mom, dad, is it okay if I invite my new boyfriend over for dinner tonight ?
- Your what ?!  Yes, I share your mother's skepticism.
Meg, if you're telling us the truth, I just hope to God he's an improvement over the last one.
You're welcome, Justin. It was a pleasure to meet you.
Besides, you can learn a lot from british nursery rhymes.
It's raining luggage and babies and limbs and daddy doesn't come home !
- It's fun to be a child.  Hey, did you read this ?
They're gonna be making an american version of Jolly Farm right here in Quahog.
Oh, my god, I didn't see that ! Gimme !
I can honestly say for the first time that I am attracted to our daughter.
You, too, Mrs. Griffin. Thanks for having me over for dinner.
Come on, Peter. I think Anthony wants some time alone with Meg.
Who doesn't want some time alone with Meg these days ?
Has anybody ever told you you're pretty enough to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin ?
Look, Anthony, trust me, she ain't what she used to be, all right ?
Once you get those pants off, It's like two sagging pressed hams and a slice of pizza.
If anyone deserves to be on Jolly Farm, it's me.
Sorry, all the boys can go home. We only have one part left for a little girl.
They're only auditioning little girls. Now come on. Let's get out of here.
Okay, our next young actress on the audition list is
Thank you all so much for squeezing me in for an audition.
I'm a bit distracted. I wasn't expecting we'd do this today
Well, your cousin is fine because I was acting !
Fun's over. What do you want me to read ?
Well, I guess sometimes you're just right for the part, like James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader.
So, James, we just want you to do the voice.
It's just that, lately, Peter's been making me feel so crappy about my age, and...
Then I'm around Anthony, he looks at me like I'm young and attractive.
Oh, I don't know. It just feels like I'm lying to Peter...
I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind buying me a drink ?
And maybe later I can show you some of the local points of interest.
Well, when your lifespan is 13 years, you gotta be direct.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on too strong.
I've been missing a man's touch lo these many months.
Oh, my god, that was hilarious ! You really fell for it !
I was, like, is he gonna fall for this And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it 'cause you know, it'll be funnier.
I'm gonna kill you ! Why are you dressed like that ?!
We both know I touched it. Now if you'd like to keep that just between us,
I suggest you sit back down and order me some chicken fingers.
Everybody, this is our new Jolly Farm resident, Karina Smirnoff.
Can we get some quiet on the set ? I'm trying to rehearse !
Yeah ! Hey, Mary, bet I'll beat you to the barn !
I mean, because I'm a woman, you think you'll beat me ?
A man is automatically better than a woman at any physical challenge ?
Well, here are a few women who might beat you to the barn :
Yes, Dan, but I felt that just because we're on a Farm,
It doesn't mean we have to be stuck in the 19th century with our value system.
I suppose we don't really have an outspoken female character on the show.
All right, Karina, we'll try it your way and see what happens.
You know, we've enjoyed having you around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
My menstrual cycle's on there, too, but I don't mind if you don't.
Your grandfather needs you to pick him up at the airport.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, I'll keep him company till you get back.
The other day you said I was attractive. Now, what are we gonna do about it ?
I've never had a MILF come on to me before.
How the hell long do you think you can keep up this charade ?
I will keep up this charahhd as it's pronounced, Brian, as long as I see fit.
You know, I'm thinking of asking them to do my makeup like yours.
I mean, I need all the help I can get, but you have such a youthful look, you could pass for 11 months.
Hey, baby, you ready to go take a nap ?
Whenever I talk to her, It makes my band-aid start to peel off.
Gotta hide it for the cameras. Instead of tucking it, I just push it in like a button and put a band-aid over it.
Nah, just one of those little dots you put on a shot.
Oh, here comes large bird and moody green garbage creature.
And I'm grouchy, so get out of my way !
Or I'll get Bernie and Gert over here to kick your butt.
Why don't you keep her company while I go fetch Karina.
Just go see for yourself, I'm not your secretary, Karina.
Why are you so cruel to me ? Is it because I'm the pretty one ?
You know, we're all sick of you ! That's right, all of us !
Sick of me ?! Oh, that's rich. You know, I wasn't going to say this, but mother hates you.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went to Edaville Railroad, and you cried because you were afraid because one of Santa's elves was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore, and he left that very night and all you cared about was ice cream on the way home and mother said you didn't appreciate anything !
Oh, yeah, I'll go make you a lemonade. I'll make you a fresh one.
I wanted to see if you could come over to my house tonight and run lines with me.
I thought maybe you and I could have a sleepover tonight.
Do you mind if I say good-bye to your brother ?
And why should I do you any favors after the terrible things you said to me earlier ?
At least I didn't bring up that time at Brigham's when you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair !
That girl in the wheelchair called me a name !
Yes, well, that gives you no right to be a blackguard !
I don't want to talk to you. Get out !
I don't know, sweetheart, but I am so, so sorry.
It was an awful thing that I did. I never meant to steal him from you.
Are you kidding ? You couldn't steal him from me.
And clearly, if I wanted him I could have him.
You couldn't even imagine the things I do for him.
And this isn't about making out, this is about power tools.
Yeah, I go to places you couldn't get back from.
He hangs me from the shower rod with your old bras, and then we laugh at you.
So, I guess I sleep in the guest room or whatnot ?
Oh, well, my goodness, I hope there's room for both of us.
You know, I really like spending time with you, Julie.
Why couldn't we just have girlfriends instead of boyfriends ?
Our daughter hates me and it's all because of you !
You've made me feel so unattractive lately that I went and did something disgusting and abhorrent and I'm ashamed of myself.
You made out with Meg's boyfriend ? How the hell could you do that to me ?
Because, Peter, you've been making me feel old and fat and unattractive and worthless.
I think you're the most beautiful woman I ever seen in my life.
But then why have you been saying all these horrible things ?
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down, you wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me and run off looking for another fella.
Maybe I want to have sex with a fat guy right now.
Well, maybe I want to have sex with an ugly, old broad.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
Have you heard, Karina ? We're gonna be doing the show live today.
I'm so nervous, I've never been on live TV before.
You see, I didn't move to Jolly Farm from the big city to be around animals.
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister, and my parents wanted her to start a new life.
But my sister Mary shot herself in the face, and that's when I decided that she would live on through me.
I am not little Mary Sunflower, daughter of Bradley and Theresa Sunflower.
Let's not start pulling threads on this one. Can we go home ?
¶ is violence in movies and sex on tv ¶
¶ lucky there's a man who positively can do ¶
You know, I don't mind so much that you're aging,
It's just the way you're shoving it down my throat.
Mom, dad, is it okay if I invite my new boyfriend
¶ ring a ring o' roses, a pocketful of posies ¶
Ooh, like this one. seven dead in mumbai.  I like their hats.
Who doesn't want some time alone with meg these days?
It's like two sagging pressed hams and a slice of pizza.
Mmm, I bet you taste like mountain dew and starburst.
If anyone deserves to be on jolly farm, it's me.
We only have one part left for a little girl.
Okay, our next young actress on the audition list is
All right, fun's over. What do you want me to read?
We want you to read your new contract! you mean it?!
Well, I guess sometimes you're just right for the part.
So, james, we just want you to do the voice.
Peter's been making me feel so crappy about my age, and...
I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind buying me a drink?
Well, when your lifespan is 13 years, you gotta be direct.
I'm-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on too strong.
And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it
Now if you'd like to keep that just between us,
I suggest you sit back down and order me some chicken fingers.
I mean, because I'm a woman, you think you'll beat me?
Well, here are a few women who might beat you to the barn:
It doesn't mean we have to be stuck in the 19th century
Around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
Oh, by the way, meg, I forgot to tell you,
Your grandfather needs you to pick him up at the airport.
Ugh, grandpa always makes me so nervous when I'm driving.
I've never had a milf come on to me before.
As it's pronounced, brian, as long as I see fit.
I mean, I need all the help I can get,
Oh, I think you're the nicest person I've ever met.
Nah, just one of those little dots you put on a shot.
Oh, here comes large bird and moody green garbage creature.
Or I'll get bernie and gert over here to kick your butt.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went
Was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore,
And all you cared about was ice cream on the way home
Well, I wanted to see if you could come over
I thought maybe you and I could have a sleepover tonight.
Hey, do you mind if I say good-bye to your brother?
Well, at least I didn't bring up that time at brigham' s
When you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair!
Yes, well, that gives you no right to be a blackguard!
I don't know, sweetheart, but I am so, so sorry.
And clearly, if I wanted him I could have him.
You couldn't even imagine the things I do for him.
And this isn't about making out; this is about power tools.
Yeah, I go to places you couldn't get back from.
With your old bras, and then we laugh at you.
So, I guess I sleep in the guest room or whatnot?
Oh, well, my goodness, I hope there's room for both of us.
You know, I really like spending time with you, julie.
Our daughter hates me and it's all because of you!
Because, peter, you've been making me feel old and fat
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down,
You wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me
Maybe I want to have sex with a fat guy right now.
Well, maybe I want to have sex with an ugly, old broad.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
You see, I didn't move to jolly farm from the big city
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister,
And my parents wanted her to start a new life.
And that's when I decided that she would live on through me.
{You know, }I don't mind so much that you're aging,
It's just the way you're shoving it down my throat.
Mom, dad, is it okay if I invite my new boyfriend over for dinner tonight ?
- Your what ?!  Yes, I share your mother's skepticism.
Meg, if you're telling us the truth, I just hope to God he's an improvement over the last one.
You're welcome, Justin. It was a pleasure to meet you.
Besides, you can learn a lot from british nursery rhymes.
It's raining luggage and babies and limbs and daddy doesn't come home !
- It's fun to be a child.  Hey, did you read this ?
They're gonna be making an american version of Jolly Farm right here in Quahog.
Oh, my god, I didn't see that ! Gimme !
I can honestly say for the first time that I am attracted to our daughter.
You, too, Mrs. Griffin. Thanks for having me over for dinner.
Come on, Peter. I think Anthony wants some time alone with Meg.
Who doesn't want some time alone with Meg these days ?
Has anybody ever told you you're pretty enough to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin ?
Look, Anthony, trust me, she ain't what she used to be, all right ?
Once you get those pants off, It's like two sagging pressed hams and a slice of pizza.
If anyone deserves to be on Jolly Farm, it's me.
Sorry, all the boys can go home. We only have one part left for a little girl.
They're only auditioning little girls. Now come on. Let's get out of here.
Okay, our next young actress on the audition list is
Thank you all so much for squeezing me in for an audition.
So, should we just jump in ?  Sure. When you're ready.
I'm a bit distracted. I wasn't expecting we'd do this today
Well, your cousin is fine because I was acting !
Fun's over. What do you want me to read ?
Well, I guess sometimes you're just right for the part, like James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader.
So, James, we just want you to do the voice.
It's just that, lately, Peter's been making me feel so crappy about my age, and...
Then I'm around Anthony, he looks at me like I'm young and attractive.
Oh, I don't know. It just feels like I'm lying to Peter...
I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind buying me a drink ?
And maybe later I can show you some of the local points of interest.
Well, when your lifespan is 13 years, you gotta be direct.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to come on too strong.
I've been missing a man's touch lo these many months.
Oh, my god, that was hilarious ! You really fell for it !
I was, like, is he gonna fall for this And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it 'cause you know, it'll be funnier.
I'm gonna kill you ! Why are you dressed like that ?!
We both know I touched it. Now if you'd like to keep that just between us,
I suggest you sit back down and order me some chicken fingers.
Everybody, this is our new Jolly Farm resident, Karina Smirnoff.
Can we get some quiet on the set ? I'm trying to rehearse !
Yeah ! Hey, Mary, bet I'll beat you to the barn !
I mean, because I'm a woman, you think you'll beat me ?
A man is automatically better than a woman at any physical challenge ?
Well, here are a few women who might beat you to the barn :
Yes, Dan, but I felt that just because we're on a Farm,
It doesn't mean we have to be stuck in the 19th century with our value system.
I suppose we don't really have an outspoken female character on the show.
All right, Karina, we'll try it your way and see what happens.
You know, we've enjoyed having you around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
My menstrual cycle's on there, too, but I don't mind if you don't.
Your grandfather needs you to pick him up at the airport.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, I'll keep him company till you get back.
The other day you said I was attractive. Now, what are we gonna do about it ?
I've never had a MILF come on to me before.
How the hell long do you think you can keep up this charade ?
I will keep up this charahhd as it's pronounced, Brian, as long as I see fit.
You know, I'm thinking of asking them to do my makeup like yours.
I mean, I need all the help I can get, but you have such a youthful look, you could pass for 11 months.
Hey, baby, you ready to go take a nap ?
Whenever I talk to her, It makes my band-aid start to peel off.
Gotta hide it for the cameras. Instead of tucking it, I just push it in like a button and put a band-aid over it.
Nah, just one of those little dots you put on a shot.
Oh, here comes large bird and moody green garbage creature.
And I'm grouchy, so get out of my way !
Or I'll get Bernie and Gert over here to kick your butt.
Why don't you keep her company while I go fetch Karina.
Just go see for yourself, I'm not your secretary, Karina.
Why are you so cruel to me ? Is it because I'm the pretty one ?
You know, we're all sick of you ! That's right, all of us !
Sick of me ?! Oh, that's rich. You know, I wasn't going to say this, but mother hates you.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went to Edaville Railroad, and you cried because you were afraid because one of Santa's elves was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore, and he left that very night and all you cared about was ice cream on the way home and mother said you didn't appreciate anything !
Oh, yeah, I'll go make you a lemonade. I'll make you a fresh one.
I wanted to see if you could come over to my house tonight and run lines with me.
I thought maybe you and I could have a sleepover tonight.
Do you mind if I say good-bye to your brother ?
And why should I do you any favors after the terrible things you said to me earlier ?
At least I didn't bring up that time at Brigham's when you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair !
That girl in the wheelchair called me a name !
Yes, well, that gives you no right to be a blackguard !
I don't want to talk to you. Get out !
I don't know, sweetheart, but I am so, so sorry.
It was an awful thing that I did. I never meant to steal him from you.
Are you kidding ? You couldn't steal him from me.
And clearly, if I wanted him I could have him.
You couldn't even imagine the things I do for him.
And this isn't about making out, this is about power tools.
Yeah, I go to places you couldn't get back from.
He hangs me from the shower rod with your old bras, and then we laugh at you.
So, I guess I sleep in the guest room or whatnot ?
Oh, well, my goodness, I hope there's room for both of us.
You know, I really like spending time with you, Julie.
Why couldn't we just have girlfriends instead of boyfriends ?
Our daughter hates me and it's all because of you !
You've made me feel so unattractive lately that I went and did something disgusting and abhorrent and I'm ashamed of myself.
You made out with Meg's boyfriend ? How the hell could you do that to me ?
Because, Peter, you've been making me feel old and fat and unattractive and worthless.
I think you're the most beautiful woman I ever seen in my life.
But then why have you been saying all these horrible things ?
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down, you wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me and run off looking for another fella.
Maybe I want to have sex with a fat guy right now.
Well, maybe I want to have sex with an ugly, old broad.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
Have you heard, Karina ? We're gonna be doing the show live today.
I'm so nervous, I've never been on live TV before.
You see, I didn't move to Jolly Farm from the big city to be around animals.
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister, and my parents wanted her to start a new life.
But my sister Mary shot herself in the face, and that's when I decided that she would live on through me.
I am not little Mary Sunflower, daughter of Bradley and Theresa Sunflower.
Let's not start pulling threads on this one. Can we go home ?
Don't you think it's a little soon for a musical about Terri Schiavo ?
Gee, look at all this stuff. How does it all work ?
- Hey, so you're the plug this year ?  Hey, Jared.
Yeah, I was the plug three years in a row.
Like I don't know that ? Everybody knows that, Jared.
Well, listen, don't you try to be a Jared plug, all right ?
You just go out there, you be the best Stewie plug you can.
but they can eat my ass, because that was awesome !
I don't know, don't you think it's kind of weird that he's in kindergarten.
God, can't you go anywhere these days without these damn paparazzi ?
Where you going ? Oh, you going to the bathroom ?
You going to have a close encounter of the turd kind ?
I'm going to plant a tree for you when I get home.
I'm going to plant a tree for you when I get home.
Now look at your hand. It's just a nub, 'cause I'm gonna cut off all the fingers.
Oh, yeah, past Peter ? Well, two can play that game.
Eh, I got some, but I didn't get the troublemaker.
Wait, what time is it ? I got to turn on TMZ.
When we caught up with her outside her home in the hills.
Rene, what was it like working with Douglas Fairbanks ?
This is my rassinfrackin' land, and I don't care what no man from no Tennessee valley authority says, consarnit !
Why are we watching TMZ ? I hate this show.
Coming out of the bathroom at his nephew's play in Rhode Island.
What do I look like, a staples ? I don't carry that stuff around.
Look, I'm sorry, I can't help you. what? You too big and famous to walk over to that corner drugstore and pick up a pen and paper and possibly some other groceries I need and come back and sign several things for me ?
I sent that in and they put it on TV, which makes me a famous journalist.
Journalist ? You're badgering a celebrity and passing it off as news.
And I got a hundred bucks for it, which I used to buy this $4, 000 video camera.
From now on I'm gonna be right where the action is, like my uncle the guy in the white hat Griffin.
Is it true you're having an affair with that oatmeal ?
What do you say about the rumors that you have a full diaper ?
How come your feet are so small ? Is it true you can't say spaghetti?
What about the rumors that you have cooties ? Is it true ?
You doubled your weight in the last six months ?
Tom, who were you having dinner ? Was it a guy ? Are you gay ?
Are the rumors I'm making up true ? Ignore me if you're gay.
What hot spot are you going to this Friday night ?
Ollie Williams, why do you look so much like Will Smith ?
Will Smith, what was it like to punch that alien in the face ?
Eddie Murphy, what was that whole thing with you and that transvestite hooker ?
And here I was going to use the money to take you to Can-Cun this winter.
I don't like Ollie anymore than you do, but we are a 21st-century family,
Okay, look, I know I was watching TV, but I'll, I'll stay late.
My chemistry teacher, Mr Taylor, rubbed my shoulders for 35 minutes in class the one day I didn't wear a bra.
He could have taken advantage of her, forced her to do things to him.
Why am I the only one who has to wear denim shorts ?
Because you're the only one who looks this good in them.
Why is there a dusty gas station and a diet Pepsi machine in your office ?
'cause your car broke down, and you need to wipe a cold soda on your neck to cool off.
You need to wipe your neck with the soda can.
I need to wipe my neck with the soda can.
I don't want to talk to her. She's gonna harass me.
He's upstairs in the shower touching himself to your picture.
And she wants me to come over to her house tonight to work on a special project.
I know she's gonna make me have sex with her. What the hell am I gonna do ?
I don't know, Peter. If you have sex with her, you give her all the power.
If you don't have sex with her, you're gay. You can't win.
I don't want to get fired and have to look for another job.
Let me get lined up right, so she'll think it's you she's having sex with.
And if you don't feel like doing Lois later, I can stick around.
You know, Angela, I've been thinking about it, and I want to have sex with you now.
Yeah, but I want to just do it through my zipper.
All right ? I don't want to have to take off all my clothes,
What do you say we go Into the bedroom ?
She's so ugly. I don't want to get in that.
Peter, I'm not gonna do it. Deal's off. Deal's off.
I'm gonna spread my legs, and it'll be you doing it, not me.
Thank you so much for having me in your home.
But Peter neglected to tell me that you are a complete dumpster fire.
Fine ! Fire me ! I'm through being harassed by you !
But I remembered part of the reason I came over was
'cause my cousin is looking for a job at the brewery.
Or else I'm gonna have to get that lady boss of yours
to come in here and give you a good shoe to the gift bag. You know, keep you in line.
We now return to Robert Mitchum In a Backhand For Sally
I said I'd go. Why'd you give me the back of your hand ?
I thought you had to be in the NBA to hit a girl in the face.
Of course you can hit a girl in the face.
What kind of a man gets fired by a broad ?
Listen, Peter, somewhere along the line, you got turned around.
And whaddaya think it means to be a man ?
It means drinkin', not because I want to, but because I need to.
It means standing up to fart, not hidin' it in a pillow or holdin' it in till your stomach goes...
Angela, what the hell are you doin' tryin' to kill yourself ?
Oh, why the hell did you pull me out of there ?
I'm talking about the fact that I have nothing to live for.
And when you spurned my advances, it was a wakeup call.
So that's why you been actin' like such a wacky ass around me ?
It's been so long since I've been with a man,
You just sorta grit your teeth and let us do what we want.
I just wish one person was able to find me attractive.
Angela, I came over here to punch you and maybe kick you in the boob.
But now all I want to do is help you out.
I'll tell you what, you know that ritzy upscale place over on third ?
You be at the stuffy fella tonight around 9 : 00.
I think I know someone who might be perfect for you.
Thank you, but that's just my gums bleeding from aggressive gingivitis.
Well, your mouth is too sweet for your teeth to want to stay in.
Well, I'm just gonna go to the powder room and freshen up.
This is easier than an american finding his brother in china.
Nothing. You know, Angela, there's something I need to tell you.
Because I vowed to myself that I would spend the last night of my life in the company of the most beautiful woman in the world.
This is already a perfect end to a perfect evening.
Oh, if only I could, but I must to a Jew to put my affairs in order.
I know what's going on here. You don't want to be with me.
But you can't kill yourself every time somebody won't sleep with you.
Just sleep with me just this once, and it'll give me everything I need.
Oh, no. I feel better than I've felt in years.
I'm ready to go back out there and meet someone.
I'm gonna have to have a word with rite-aid about this fake mustache.
Well, I got my job back, Angela's happy again, and she's not gonna harass me anymore.
Uh-oh, Rupert, we've got company, and I don't think it's the Avon lady.
No matter what happens, it's been a privilege to serve under you.
Don't relax yet, Rupert, those fighters had to have been coming from somewhere.
Wait a minute, Rupert, there's a weapons systems cooling duct on the far side of the hull.
If we can get just one good shot at it, we can blow that fat bastard out of the cosmos.
Got you! Got you! Got you! Got you! Got you!
Stewie, get lost. Daddy's trying to watch the ball game.
I don't know, I just feel like there might be some fun stuff down there.
It's basically Jaws, except when the guys in the boat are going after Jaws, they look around and there's an even bigger Jaws, so the guys have to team up with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.
I don't even remember if it's any good or not.
You know, this is actually not too bad a piece of work.
This was... this was kind of deep as I recall.
You know, Lois, you-you might actually be interested in reading this.
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian, I haven't gotten around to it.
I don't even know what I did with the copy that you ga...
Why-why don't you put check marks next to scenes you like?
You know, I'll-I'll just leave it for you right here.
Hey, you know what I'll do to make it even easier?
I'll just go ahead and place this in your hand.
And now when you go, Oh, where's that crazy pen?
Brian, I'm not gonna read this with you standing here.
Why the hell's it taking her so long to read that thing?
I don't know, I saw her giving Joe notes on his pilot this morning.
I would have told you last night, but I was 100% sure you ripped it off.
But after spending the last 18 hours on the Internet and in libraries trying to find traces of it somewhere,
Look, I don't want to get your hopes up, but Daddy's got some connections over at CBS, and I think he could help you get this on TV.
Wow, Brian, you must feel like Hitler did after he wrote Mein Kampf.
(chuckles) Dear Diary, still no sign of that tampon from last week, but the headaches are getting worse.
Brian, I'm afraid I'm going to have to be blunt with you. Yeah?
Oh, my God, (laughs) I felt like Hitler just then.
Anything I can do to make your life a little easier.
Well, you could always grab the vacuum and clean up the living room floor.
Brian, have you decided who's gonna star in your show?
I mean, Byron is a 25-year-old single father going back to finish college so he can do right by his four-year-old daughter.
So it's got to be somebody who can project a certain amount of world-wizened sophistication, while at the same time retaining a certain youthfully passionate idealism.
Actually, in my mind, there's only one actor who could do this role: Elijah Wood.
I got a little bit of a crush on him, I have.
Hi, I'm Todd Goldstein, senior executive of programming here at the network.
I hope you brought the magic wand you wrote this with.
Oh, all right, I can tell this is gonna be a fun process.
You know, Brian, you've spun gold into these pages, and it's our job to bring that gold to the screen.
So, what do you say we get this casting session started, huh?
Okay, now obviously, we love Elijah Wood for the part of Byron as much as you do.
Now, this is the scene where Byron's professor fails him for missing the chemistry midterm to take his daughter to the doctor.
I'm sorry, Byron, missing the midterm is an automatic failure.
I don't care because I got an A today... as a dad.
Maybe this is news to you, but love isn't some element on your periodic table.
Keep your chromium and magnesium, because I discovered a much more precious element.
Look, since we're playing with house money, we do have one more guy.
Somebody upstairs threw out a name, got real excited about it, so we're just playing the game.
Wait a second. I don't want this guy anywhere near this show!
He stalked my best friend and then he stole his identity!
I felt whatever the most senior executive in this room felt.
I thought you said you weren't gonna mess with my show.
Well, we thought it would be a lot funnier if it was a sitcom.
It's a serious drama about a single father raising his four-year-old daughter.
Now, this is just a thought, but we're doing it.
It was James Woods' idea and we thought it was just the right hook.
Hey, do you guys think this outfit is too revealing?
I mean, what-what do you think of the ta-tas, you know what I mean?
Can we do better? I think we can do better, right?
I think the maggots have evolved to the point that they've developed space travel.
We should have told somebody, but we were too scared, and-and-and I wanted to take him to the hospital, but Chris wouldn't let me.
I used to knock you kids out every month or so, sometimes by accident, sometimes when the Patriots lost.
You just gotta cover it up, and eventually it all works out.
One of those hats would have helped him at the park today.
Hey, good evening, everyone, and welcome to the first taping of CBS's new hit comedy,
Yeah, it didn't make a lot of sense now that he lives on Boner Street.
You have to sleep with the next guy that walks through that door.
They want to pick up Class Holes! for 22 episodes!
Hey, guys, the chimp just ripped the other girl's boob off.
Lois, I-I wish you hadn't gone through all this trouble.
I just knew it was gonna make it on TV.
Well, yeah, I mean, but the real victory is just having a show make it to TV.
Hey, what's the cast of Two and a Half Men doing here?
All right, got the little guy up from his nap.
You said you'd win that talent show and you did.
Look, I'm sure you're disappointed, Lois, but it wasn't my fault.
You had a vision and you let them change it because you didn't believe in yourself.
It was either do it their way or get cancelled.
Well, at least then you would have had your integrity.
We did some testing this morning, and we think we've discovered the problem.
Byron wants to do right by his daughter, and I think that everyone can relate to that.
The simple love within a family that conquers all and makes life worth living.
What if I'm a cop and the chimp is my reincarnated partner?
And every month, he's got a story for why he doesn't have his half of the rent.
I wrote a script that really meant a lot to me, and you guys took it and turned it into something cheap and ridiculous.
'cause I banged that chick, and I think she is well under 18 years old.
I think we gotta take these bandages off and see what we're dealin' with here.
He's really hurt, and I'm gonna do what I should have done in the first place.
Let's put a hat on him to cover the wound, and-and then let's get some makeup and draw eyeballs on his eyelids and find a way to pin this on someone else.
You went in there and you stood up for what you believed in.
And hey, at least I got something on the air.
Our top story tonight, scientists at NASA have made a fascinating new discovery: the first directly observable instance of a black hole, which appears to be located just outside our solar system.
Tom, I'm standing here with Stephen Hawking, the first white man I've ever met who knows math better than me.
Mr. Hawking, what does the discovery of this black hole mean to you and your research?
I'm telling you, man, this shtick is getting so old.
I am part of an elite group of individuals deemed intelligent enough to decide the fate of a fellow citizen.
You know, they don't just pick anybody for this job.
The only reason you've never been called is that they use the voter registration list, and this past election is the first time you ever voted.
And the nominees for Best Actor in a Leading Role are:
Grover, Bluto from Popeye, a red guy, a boob and Daniel Day Lewis.
Wait a second. Y-You're saying that everyone is asked to do jury duty?
And if your wife ever tells you that you're not special, punch her really hard right in her hepatitis.
Turns out it's not a special honor at all. It's lame.
And the worst part is, they try and trick you into getting excited by putting duty in the title.
So, you were excited when you thought there was fecal matter involved?
Peter, jury duty is an important cornerstone in our democratic society.
How 'bout we do a song that's not whiny bull crap?
We're gonna ask you a series of questions to determine whether or not you can be impartial jurors.
First off, do any of you have any prejudices you feel the court should know of?
All ganging up and walking my pie off the picnic blanket.
All right, now the prosecution is about to show you items pertinent to this case that have been entered into evidence.
It is vitally important that you look but don't touch, as any fingerprints could contaminate them.
All right, everyone, we're going to take a ten-minute recess.
I would like to remind members of the jury that you are forbidden to discuss details of the case outside the courtroom.
Aw, hey, you know how the judge told us not to make up our minds beforehand?
Hey, I know the judge said not to run in the hall, but check this out!
We now return to How Henry Kissinger Met Your Mother.
I was walking with my professor when I saw this woman who was...
Oh, stop it, you're the one with the sick abs.
You buy your kids ridiculously homoerotic dolls and then ask what happened?
I don't want to go back to stupid jury duty.
There's got to be some way I can get out of it.
NASA has made the alarming announcement that the newly discovered black hole at the edge of our solar system appears to be expanding.
Neptune and Pluto have already been consumed, and scientists estimate that the event horizon will reach Earth by tomorrow.
Which means th all life on Earth will be destroyed within 24 hours.
Seems like I've run out of waiting time. ...but it looks like Nicole Ritchie's baby is gonna be just fine.
Also in the news, the doomsday clock is ticking with less than 19 hours to go before our planet is consumed by an expanding black hole.
As Americans everywhere face their last day on Earth, one can only imagine how they're spending it.
Well, it's become clear, the only way to avert this disaster is by writing a strongly-worded letter to the black hole. Dear space. Well, you're just full of surprises, aren't you? You think you're so good 'cause you went to Choate. Well, you're not gonna be so tough when I put a fish bowl on my head and a rocket pack on my back and come up there and punch you.
What do you mean? You've had sex a million times.
Well, Diane, now that our time is almost up, just to lighten the mood, we introduce a new feature called Tom's Crank Calls.
It's fun to see how people react when they're on the spot.
I want you kids to know how much your father and I love you and how important this family is to us.
I don't know, but from the look in a stray cat's eyes when you're pushing on its windpipe,
You know, I went to the zoo last week and asked if I could do it, and they told me to scram.
Went to the zoo this morning with a shotgun and now I have a lion.
Does it bite? Of course it bites, it's a lion.
We should be spending these final hours with the people we love most.
Lois, a day ago, I was stuck on jury duty.
Today, I have a golden ticket to do whatever the hell I want.
I feel like an old guy who's reliving his youthful shenanigans.
We used to give each other wet-willies and funny arms.
It was real, good old-fashioned grab the nearest tree and hold on for dear life gay, not today's fancy, featherbed, thread-count gay.
I've always wanted to save a Native American family from rapacious cavalrymen.
Stay with us as the countdown to Doomsday continues with just six more hours to go.
The only thing that's nice about this is even though it's a Tuesday, it feels kinda like it's a Friday.
I'm gonna find a black neighborhood and see what happens if I yell the you-know-what word.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is it, our final minutes.
Any moment now, the Earth will be sucked into the gaping maw of the black hole.
We here at Channel Five would like to leave you with some highlights of mankind's brief existence, like the Battle of Hastings.
This is what I want our empire to be about.
And with only 30 seconds to go, we thank you for choosing Channel Five as your Armageddon network.
You know, you'd think you'd wanna spend your last day on Earth with your family!
You're the most important person in the world to me!
Sorry, I just thought I'd be honest since we're gonna die. ...three, two, one.
We at Channel Five News concocted the whole black hole story as part of our commitment to being festive around the holidays.
And with only 87 suicides and widespread looting, we think this was a pretty successful practical joke.
Peter, what did you mean by what you said, you hate bein' around the kids?
Kids, why don't you go upstairs so your father and I can talk.
Well, I'm off to serve food at the soup kitchen.
I kinda have to keep a promise I made to someone.
I know, and I love 'em, but don't you just sometimes wish they'd run away or get kidnapped and be made to work in a Temple of Doom?
Because, Lois. Meg tells a story that makes you wanna blow your brains out,
Stewie just sits there and Chris is always leaving his Russian mice around.
You've hurt your kids worse than any black hole could!
So, Chris, how, uh, how are all your friends at school?
Come on, guys. Let's go eat in the living room.
I think we can make up some of these losses in the third quarter.
I thought I smelled a fart, but now I don't.
Peter, they heard you say you hate being around them.
They, they know you have no interest in getting to know them.
Peter, if you really do care about your kids, you're gonna have to earn back their respect and affection.
You gotta spend time with them and make their interests your interests.
I'm just trying to take an interest in your interests.
It's something that happens to me that I cannot control.
You know, I was just thinkin', when I was your age, my Uncle Roy shared a beer with me.
I drank it, and I was so excited, I fell asleep.
Anyway, I thought him sharing that beer with me was the coolest thing ever.
And I know nowadays things are different... so I got some crystal meth.
I figured we could do it together as father and son.
All I know is the guys who made it are dead.
Trapjaw is trying to get a variance to build an unpermitted structure within ten feet of Optimus Prime's property line.
Destro is the City Councilman who's telling Trapjaw that he has to file it as an accessory structure, and even then it can only be built at the rear of the lot.
I don't know what else I possibly could have done.
Somehow you've gotta let those kids know that they matter to you.
Look, I know you kids ain't too happy with your dad right now, but I hope at least you could see that I'm tryin'.
I mean, I know sometimes we don't get along with each other.
Hell, if we weren't all related, this would be like the worst table at the wedding.
Well, then how come you said you hated spending time with us?
Look, I may not have said exactly what I meant.
But I-I can still be your dad even if we don't have any of the same interests.
So what do you say, are we a family again?
When you jumped through my ceiling, you let an owl in.
I know they're supposed to be wise, but all it did was shriek and poop out half-digested mice.
Well, I guess if you can't earn your kids' respect, you can always buy it.
Dad, can we please have a turn at the Xbox? uh, now, which one do I press to shoot now?
Look, if you're no good, why don't you just go hide till the end?
Good evening, America. Tonight we present a full hour of Family Guy, beginning with a very special extended episode, followed by some never-before-seen musical clips.
So, without further ado, here's a little episode entitled  Stewie and Brian.
Really? Shouldn't it be person before animal, like Turner and Hooch?
We still have to swing by Wyndham's before they close.
And why do you have a safety deposit box anyway?
What's in there that you can't bury in the yard?
I was gonna take it home, show it to Lois, make her proud of me.
Hey, I'm starving. You want to grab a late lunch?
And if I want to return this sweater, we've got to get to Wyndham's by half 6:00. Half 6:00?
Yes. You have to return it within a fortnight for a refund.
I love it, but I feel like it was too much.
You know, today started as a really nice outing, but as usual, you had to ruin it.
You know, I-I was actually hoping that you'd talk me out of returning this sweater.
You know, it's the one time I ever splurged on myself, and you have to go and make me feel foolish.
It's my own fault for thinking I could have pretty things.
These bank vault doors close automatically at the end of the workday.
Well, there's got to be some way out of here. Think!
So, you invented a time machine, but you can't get us out of a safe?
Can't believe this. We're locked in here until tomorrow and the only thing I've eaten today was a grape Chris dropped at breakfast.
It took me half an hour just to get the damn thing off the floor.
I'm not gonna be able to stay like this until tomorrow, you know.
Well, I don't know what you expect me to do about it.
Look, I'm ing to propose something, and I need you to hear me out.
Okay, well, I can't be in a soiled diaper until tomorrow, Brian; we both know that.
I'll get a rash, which could lead to an infection if left like this.
See, you're, you're not... you're not really thinking this through.
W-We would still be faced with the problem of the odor, you see.
And-and, of course, you know, then what am I gonna do with no diaper?
I'm-I'm not gonna walk around here with-with my Tic Tac hanging out.
Well, well, no, I mean, not right now we don't, no.
And, you know, I've seen you eat poop before, Brian.
How messed up in the head are you that y-you would even ask?
So what I would need you to do is eat what's in my diaper, lick the diaper clean, possibly lick my fanny and then put the diaper back on me.
Yeah, you should start wrapping your brain around that, too.
Well, I don't see a way around it, do you?
There's a gun in your safety deposit box, isn't there?
Stewie, come on. You don't know how to use that thing.
Oh, really? What if I hold it sideways like a black guy?
Whoa, whoa, come on, man. Take it easy, all right?
There's not gonna be any trouble as long as you eat my poo.
Wait a minute. Don't you have your cell phone with you?
Yes, hi. Can you connect me to men's designer wear, please?
I think you're the salesman who helped me pick out a Thom Browne sweater two weeks ago.
Um, and I don't think I'm gonna make it to the store before closing time today.
Is it possible to get an extension on that refund?
So you're telling me if I was James Franco calling,
I would still not be able to get an extension for one day?
You wasted the one phone call we had to return a sweater?!
You stink! And now I'm trapped in here with you and your stink because you were too stupid to call somebody who could help us!
I suppose the easiest way would be to use the diaper as a-a bowl of sorts.
All right, well, we should get your overalls off first.
It's so amazing to me that you know how to do that.
All right, now let's get this diaper back on you.
She gets all up in my biznatch with those. No, no way.
This will take one second, and then we can put this whole unpleasantness behind us.
Oh, and just do me a favor and tell me when you're about to begin because I don't wanna be surpri...  Moon river!
Was kind of saving it, but, uh... what the hell, right?
I like what comes out of Lois' breasts better, but I, I like this, too.
I feel like, I feel like a big boy right now.
Oh, wait, I can hurdle my own leg like they used to do in the '90s.
Okay, all right, you know, this is gonna sound really weird.
This is gonna sound really weird, but I really want you to do it, okay? Wha... what?
First you have to say that you'll do it before I tell you, no mat... no matter what it is.
Oh, you know, I think this is going to look so good on me.
I don't give a... I'm all worked up right now, so we have to do it. Just do it, okay?
You know, I don't, I don't know why I told Matthew that I liked, that I liked The Bounty Hunter
I just, I wanted him to like me in that moment.
I don't... Why do I... why do I do that?
Why do I...? Why am I such a people pleaser, you know?
This is like the closest I've ever felt to you.
I think the pin's too thick to go all the way through.
Oh, I knew it was... I knew it would look... it would look cool.
Don't we have to put an earring in it so the hole won't close?
This is gonna seem stupid, but I've been dying to know.
No, it's, some, some of that stuff, some of that stuff is right on.
Cesar Millan. Right, Cesar Millan talks about living in the moment because that's how dogs live, you know?
In us, you know? It's like I can't not do it.
There's something off about him, but I hope it's not that.
You know, people can learn a lot from dogs, you know?
I mean, you don't really do any of those things, do you?
Hey, whoa, whoa. Look, I didn't mean to start anything.
How dare you tell me that my life doesn't have purpose.
No, that's not what I said. That's what you're saying.
No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't try to turn my words on me.
You're gonna be hearing a lot worse once you go to school.
No, you're just smart enough and you're just clever enough to occasionally amuse me.
If I had anybody else- anybody else to choose from-- I would.
Yeah, you were afraid you were going to get sick.
Come on, Brian, I spend half the day in a dirty diaper.
I thought, How low can I get this douchebag to go?
And when you did it, I actually felt sorry for you.
You son of a bitch, I could kill you for that!
Here you go, Brian. You want to kill me? Kill me with this.
Oh, but there are no bullets in it, are there?
Besides, if you shot me, it'd all be caught on that security camera.
Security cam... Oh, my God, maybe somebody can see us!
No one's out there, Brian. They would have come in.
Oh, my God, oh, that is gonna be on YouTube.
Everybody that works in an office is gonna say to their coworkers, Hey, type in 'dog, baby, heinie lick.'
And then the boss is gonna say, Hey, what are you doing there?
Oh, yeah, that's funny. I saw that in my room. Okay, now type in 'Japanese, fish, ass.'
Well, I could save you the embarrassment and shoot you in the head except there aren't any bullets in this gun.
That's why I keep it in my safety deposit box.
Oh, picky for someone who eats the same food out of a plastic bowl on the floor every night.
A bowl that starts in the kitchen at the beginning of a meal and ends up in the living room. Shut up.
And then forgets four seconds later that he ate it. Shut up!
Ooh, harsh tone, you just got bumped down to coconut mint.
You... you... what about all that liberal crap you're always spewing about stricter gun regulations?
I mean, you're the last person anybody would expect to have a gun.
Well, that's why I keep it here where it's safe.
I hate the idea of you getting your thrills pressing a gun up against your crotch.
You know, I really don't want to talk about this with you, Stewie.
Oh, good, 'cause that'd be strange if you had fantasies about pressing a gun up against your crotch and feeling your heartbeat through your balls.
I keep it in case... I ever want to commit suicide, okay?
Just having the gun here, knowing there's a way out, it... it helps.
At least then you might grow an inch or two while you're hanging there.
Of course, when they find you, you might have those Illeana Douglas eyes.
Yesterday when you said I don't live with purpose... you were right.
Dogs are supposed to be able to instinctively live with purpose, not even to have think about it, just born like that.
You know, I've tried to find meaning in my life, and I just... I just can't.
And, you know, I'm not talking about purpose in the shallow, Rick Warren over-the-counter self-help variety because that's... that's just delusion.
I mean, is there ever a time when we're truly in the present moment and not looking toward the past or the future?
No, I was just putting money in my Christmas club.
You know, last year I only had $30 saved when the holidays came around.
Well, you're the... only person I've ever told this to.
I thought you said I was the best of a bad situation.
I was just trying to hurt you 'cause you hurt me.
I would even dare to go a little further perhaps.
I mean, not in like a Hey, let's, you know, let's have an underpants party, or whatever grownups do when they're in love, but I mean,
I mean, I love you as one loves another person whom one simply cannot do without.
Because that's just about the greatest gift one friend can give another.
Wait, wait, wait. I want to get all snuggled in.
Okay, go. Chapter One: I am born. Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station shall be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life,
I record that I was born on a Friday, at 12:00 at night...
And for the rest of the hour, we'd like to treat you to some of your favorite Family Guy musical moments.
That's right. Some you may know, and others you've never seen before- like this first one.
A few years back, Lois had a visit from her long-lost brother, Patrick.
He had an irrational hatred of fat people and began strangling them.
Peter and his friends from the National Association for the Advancement of Fat People never got to mourn for any of the victims.
People, people, I know what will make us feel better.
One thing we like to do at Family Guy is make fun of pop culture by twisting it and mocking it and commenting on it.
Yeah, and sometimes we just steal stuff and put our characters in it.
A Jerry Lewis film entitled The Errand Boy that was created for the episode where Peter takes over Pewterschmidt Industries.
Several years back, Brian made friends with an elderly woman who had been homebound for years, and he attempted to bring her out of her shell.
We became close friends, and I sang this song to explain to her all the wonderful things that she was missing by shutting herself off from society.
And by the song's end, she felt the courage to venture out.
And did she get to see all those things you sang about?
No. She immediately got hit by a truck and died.
Ah. Well, then, I'm sure she's glad she met you.
Here's the musical number that ended that poor woman's life.
There's so much you've missed in the last 30 years.
A man could mingle with scores of all the seediest whores
But that's a fear that you can put to bed
They'll shave your ass and glue it on your head
You've still got a hell of a lot to see
I wouldn't be standing here right now if it wasn't for you.
Quahog is a wonderful example of suburban America-- full of neighbors who look out for each other and enjoy spending time together.
Up next, we find Peter and Lois in need of a babysitter, and their kind, elderly neighbor, Herbert, offers to help out.
It's a musical number that will warm the cockles of your heart.
So, it would only be till Monday, and we could pay you for it.
Got the time and the place and I got rhythm
Now all I need is Chris to go with 'em
And now we have a super special treat: a never-before-aired clip that may be the greatest thing we've ever done.
Featuring the last known recording of Michael Jackson, here is...
Now, a woman who'll kiss on the very first date
And a woman who'll kiss on the second time out
But a woman who'll wait till the third time around
She will never get sore if you beg her pardon
She will never get sore on the way to supper
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, do, si, do
Now, little ol' Sal was a no gal as anyone could see
Look at her now, she's a go gal who only goes for me
She will never get sore on the way to supper
Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, do, si, do
You know, when it comes to road show episodes, you and I do most of the traveling.
True, but when Peter found out that his father wasn't Francis, the man who raised him, but instead a man in Ireland, Peter decided to visit.
And did we explore the effects of the difficult political and agricultural dynamics that have rent Ireland for centuries?
No. We just made them a country of drunken redheads.
You knocked up my mom and never called her again.
All feel the same mixture of pride and of shame
Do you remember when Peter got his own TV station?
We all sang a song about how they take the best parts out of everything.
I know, and the worst part is that after the song aired, we heard the FCC people liked it.
I mean, like, you know, like when-when... when you make fun of someone and then they laugh.
And then they're supposed to be like, Oh, you got me.
I-I don't know-- it just... it ruins it for me.
Actually, because of your little rant, we don't have time for that song.
What? You thought I was leaving forever and you just said, Good luck?
The fact that your last name is Griffin is a pleasantry extended from our family, not by any legality.
Yeah, and someday, when you're ready, you're gonna walk off into the woods and die.
Yeah, so there's this seminar in New Haven on creating your own Web-based Internet series.
Is this another one of those classes where you make the checks out directly to the teacher's name?
You gonna go, Brian, or should I get the can of pennies?
So, we're finally gonna get to meet the man of a thousand chicks.
That's right. You think I've been with a lot of broads.
Anyway, the navy is honoring him at this year's naval ball for all his bravery in Vietnam.
Sure am. He was like a hero to me when I was growing up.
Hey, Glenn, you're not gonna give your dad an entrance?
Don't want to get behind you in the mess hall, huh?
I'd stand and salute you, sir, but this is the best I can do.
Sir, you gotta tell them about the time you had to eject from your plane behind enemy lines.
And I will, but first, it's been a long trip.
Okay, fine. I'll make you one; you tell a story.
So, anyhoo, I remember that day like it was yesterday.
I'd gotten a haircut earlier that day, the first one I ever got over there that looked like anything.
The breeze was just warm enough that you could wear short sleeves, but you know, not so warm that you break any kind of a sweat. because let me tell you, I do hate to perspire. It just ruins...
And I gotta tell you, though, this seminar is great.
I'll tell you all about it when I get home, okay?
I'll talk to you later. Wait, wait, hang on, Brian!
There was, um, something else I wanted to tell you.
Um, the mail came a little later than usual today.
I thought you'd be out on the town with Quagmire and hid dad.
And a lot of little things: the way he talks, his mannerisms, and he had the complete DVD set of Sex and the City between his butt cheeks.
I was just being colorful with the rest of it.
Well, maybe you should go talk to Glenn about it.
I guess I could, but I don't know if it'll do any good, Lois; he's in complete denial, like people in massive debt.
Well, honey, I've extended our line of credit and exhausted all our savings.
Well, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do: shoot all of our children and then kill ourselves.
My dad wanted me to tell you he would be thrilled if you and Lois would join us as his guest at the naval ball.
Um... hey, remember when we met him the other day, and he danced for a while?
At the navy ball, you'll see how much of a man he is and how everyone in the military respects him.
All of these people came out just to honor you.
Oh, it feels good, son; I won't lie to you.
Huh. It's great to see you back in your element tonight; surrounded by seamen. Seamen.
He flew supplies in where others wouldn't dare to go.
I can't tell you how many loads you dad took when I served with him. Huh?
He'd walk into an army barracks and make every private there feel important.
Every day at rifle training, he'd help me clean my butt.
If there was one man you wanted in your hole, it was your dad.
But I am a woman trapped in a man's body.
Okay, so he wants to be a woman so he can be a lesbian?
Okay, this is not the help I came over here for.
Well, look, let's just all agree that he's odd, huh?
He has an appointment Friday with Dr. Hartman to have the procedure, and he wants me to go with him.
I-I just, I don't know if I can handle that.
Well, I'm sure your friend Peter would be happy to come along for moral support.
Anything he lops off, we get to bring home for Brian.
We should put on some '80s music, and then, like, every few minutes, have him come out of there as a different sex, and we'll go...
And then like the fifth or sixth sex, we'll go like this...
Okay, kids, Mr. Quagmire and his dad... his moth... his friend are coming over soon for dinner.
And, Meg, you know how it is to be different, so be very nice.
We can't sit here and just pretend everything's the same.
They just turn it inside out to simulate a vagina.
Not a bad option to have in the back pocket.
But I did put a lot of planning into the meal.
Lois, I have to say, you look so put together.
You just burned your last friend in this room, lady.
Is that just like, r... implas or did they reassign some ass fat up there?
Golly, Lois, where do you shop? Gee, your house looks beautiful.
My dad, my dad,  talking about decorating and women's clothing?
All I've talked about for years with these people is what a war hero you were.
My friend who pees sitting down but can also palm a basketball?
You know, you're asking me to accept an awful lot.
I... I... I don't know if I can do this.
I had the advantage of thinking about this for years.
For me it was easy: Do I want to be happy the rest of my life or miserable?
Well, you see, when I watch the world go by,
I think of it kind of like a huge screen.
You know, every little interaction, every little moment is another scene captured by this camera.
So I finally tell them, Hey, I came here to be at the seminar, not run it.
Oh, it was terrific. The first day we were there...
You-you guys are not gonna get to me this morning.
No, that's just it-- it was right here in town last night.
Not to worry, I called in, and a new cell phone should be here for you in three business days.
God... Doesn't anyone in this house care about anyone but themselves?
And then I get back here last night, and I meet an incredible woman.
You know, I've heard the phrase soul mate for years, and I never got it till last night.
Well, I've got a woman story for you that you're not gonna believe.
Yeahit's, it's not settling with the Q-man all too well.
Oh, my God, that-- you know, that is a tough road ahead.
I mean, like, what do those people do as far as relationships and sex and stuff?
I mean, it's got to be a train wreck down there, right?
Is she over there right now? We should go take a look.
No. They had a fight; she's staying at the Marriott.
Yeah, maybe I saw him in the lobby and didn't even know.
Oh, what?! What the hell? ! What's wrong with you?!
When they move to a new place, they're supposed to notify the neighborhood.
Oh, Dad, I've been worried sick. Where have you been?
Listen, I... I feel awful about the things I said last night.
I was wrong to just assume that you would understand and be able to accept this.
But, trust me, I had been unhappy for a long, long time.
Well, all I want is for you to be happy.
Okay, well, so now that we got all the mush out of the way,
Don't get scared that you can hear my voice but you can't see me.
This is the story of a great adventure that happened to me and some of my pals.
It all began innocently enough, with my stupid wife showing me some dumb-ass brochure.
You and I will have one cabin, and Bonnie and Joe and Quagmire will have the other two.
All right, but if it's a trap and we don't come back,
I get to make smart-alecky remarks when we're tied up back-to-back, like last time.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, the reason Chris was suspended is that he told a very inappropriate joke in class.
Well, Principal Shepherd, we promise you it won't happen again.
I don't know where Chris heard the joke, but I can assure you it wasn't at home.
Was it the one where the blind man walks by the fish market and says, Good morning, ladies?
You know, you got Chris suspended from school for telling one of your dirty jokes.
So, this chick meets a guy at a bar, and...
I didn't know what to do, so I took them off and hummed them at the wall, and they started sliding down like one of them sticky octopuses.
Well, it's a pretty funny joke, you know, when you think about it. Your vagina's in the sink.
When you poop in your dreams, you poop for real.
That's right. Thought I'd come by and see if you have any jokes to tell.
I want to tell the joke, but I like those pants.
You know, I-I got to admit, Quagmire, despite all the problems, that joke is freaking hilarious.
I mean, somebody's got to be making these things up.
We go on a quest to find the source of the world's dirty jokes.
And so began our journey to find the splendid source of off-color humor as we know it.
We were wondering where you heard that dirty joke you told Quagmire.
I'm not going to tell y'all that one here at the workplace.
Look, you blade, just tell us who you heard it from.
It turned out the joke already had quite a history.
Tucker heard it from Bender on Futurama, oddly enough, for some reason.
REO Speedwagon saved us several stops, as they, too, had backtracked the joke to some extent.
But when their trail had led to a bartender in Virginia, they had given up, much the way the world had given up on them.
In fact, just to kick them a couple extra bucks, here's five seconds of Time for Me to Fly.
Don't be stupid. Somebody had to have made it up.
Besides, this will be way more fun than hanging out in Maine with the wives, sitting around a campfire, listening to Lois tell grocery stories. Oh, Peter, you should have been there. Uncle Ben's converted brown rice was on sale.
Whatever-- I don't know how much rice is, but you know what I'm saying.
Say, ladies, I was wondering if you could tell me-- what was childbirth like?
Think of the most intense pain you've ever felt, and imagine feeling that for hours.
They didn't think I was far enough, but I was like, I can tell you I'm far enough.
Have you girls ever worked in an office with other women who you have negative things to say about?
All right, look, we're sorry we deceived you girls, but this is important.
We've traveled a very long way to find out where you heard this joke.
Donna, it's so nice of you to invite us to stay here.
I don't think we've seen you folks since the wedding.
Hey, you know, Cleveland, you better hide the markers from your kids.
Somebody colored in your ass with too much ass, fat-ass.
I met him when I took Cleveland Jr. there to see the Lincoln Memorial.
But then Daddy got frustrated 'cause he couldn't find it, so we just ate fast food in the parking lot.
Everyone, don't get too used to being around black people,
Donna's been nice enough to invite us to stay the weekend, and frankly, that sounds better than continuing this wild-goose chase.
Well, Lois, if you and Bonnie want to stay here, maybe Cleveland could join us.
All right, well, if you have a sudden change of heart and you want to chase us down the street as we're pulling away, you know where to find us.
Would you rather get a massage from a man or surgery from a female doctor?
So, it's basically- would you rather get a massage from a gay man or die?
Let Amy Winehouse spit in your mouth or eat a raw slice of Anderson Cooper's ass?
I saw one of them back in the bar in Stoolbend.
Either that or they got a grudge against our back windshield.
It might be safe to assume that someone does not want us to learn the origin of that joke.
And if we had known what lay ahead, we would've stopped right there and gone straight back to Quahog.
There it is-- Washington, DC, the seat of government for the world's former most powerful nation.
Wow, those are all the monuments I read about in school.
Yeah, check out that Vietnamese guy giving the business to those Vietnam Vets.
All right, this is the hotel where the bellhop works.
I was wondering if my friends and I could ask you a few questions.
Yeah, where'd you hear that dirty joke you told Cleveland?
I think he went that way, past the Reflecting Pool!
Hold on a sec. Hey, pal, stop talking while I'm talking, all right?
Our journey had abruptly ended, and the trail had gone cold.
Well, I guess we're never gonna find the source of that joke.
I guess there's nothing to do now but head back home.
We were all terrified that this would prove to be an unexpected end to our journey.
But little did we know, our journey was far from over.
That was the whole reason we walked through Crate & Barrel.
And as if that weren't bad enough, we found ourselves on a plane, headed to an unknown destination.
Every plane there's gotta be a crying baby and a mother ignoring it.
After flying for what seemed like hours, we found ourselves approaching a strange island on the horizon.
The Dean of the Secret Order of Dirty Joke Writers.
So these are the people who write all the world's dirty jokes?
So the housewife tells the plumber, Okay, you cleed my pipes, now get to work on that sink.
Is there some joke area of a beaver eating a woodpecker?
Well, many of the world's greatest geniuses secretly devote themselves to coming up with the world's dirtiest jokes.
Ha! There you go, put that in one of your jokes.
From this room, we can see the entire world's joke supply.
This way we can tailor jokes to where the need is greatest.
Sir, we have a Best Man giving a toast at a wedding, and he is just bombing.
Jim's... Jim's so clumsy, it's like he's got two left feet and left hands.
Permission to go to the bride is a whore file, sir.
Anyway, if Sheila was a road sign, it would read Open Trench.
Well, gentlemen, I hope you've enjoyed the tour of our facility.
I can't wait to tell all the guys back at the Clam!
You know about our network of joke distribution agents, like the bellhop.
I'm afraid you must stay here for the rest of your lives.
Hey, guys, I can see the plane that brought us here!
If we can figure out a way to get to it, I can fly us home!
One of us should pretend we're hurt, and when the guards come in to give him medical attention, we'll jump 'em!
All right, let's hurry up and find a way out!
Well, well, it's quite clear the four of you are going to be a problem.
I have written the greatest dirty joke in the history of mankind!
It's heading for the first dead baby joke ever written!
We destroyed a place that brought joy and laughter to the entire world.
But Peter's got the best one ever written right there.
Now take me back to Virginia, so I can put some Bacitracin on this and pork my wife!
And it was great having Cleveland along with us again.
Anyway, that's our story about the splendid source of all dirty jokes.
For those of you who stuck around till the end, you deserve a reward.
See, the March of Dimes wanted this air time to talk about cancer kids or somethin', but I was like, No way! Monkey scratch!
Don't get scared that you can hear my voice but you can't see me.
This is the story of a great adventure that happened to me and some of my pals.
It all began innocently enough, with my stupid wife showing me some dumb-ass brochure.
You and I will have one cabin, and Bonnie and Joe and Quagmire will have the other two.
All right, but if it's a trap and we don't come back,
I get to make smart-alecky remarks when we're tied up back-to-back, like last time.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, the reason Chris was suspended is that he told a very inappropriate joke in class.
Well, Principal Shepherd, we promise you it won't happen again.
I don't know where Chris heard the joke, but I can assure you it wasn't at home.
Was it the one where the blind man walks by the fish market and says, Good morning, ladies?
You know, you got Chris suspended from school for telling one of your dirty jokes.
So, this chick meets a guy at a bar, and...
I didn't know what to do, so I took them off and hummed them at the wall, and they started sliding down like one of them sticky octopuses.
Well, it's a pretty funny joke, you know, when you think about it. Your vagina's in the sink.
When you poop in your dreams, you poop for real.
That's right. Thought I'd come by and see if you have any jokes to tell.
I want to tell the joke, but I like those pants.
You know, I-I got to admit, Quagmire, despite all the problems, that joke is freaking hilarious.
I mean, somebody's got to be making these things up.
We go on a quest to find the source of the world's dirty jokes.
And so began our journey to find the splendid source of off-color humor as we know it.
We were wondering where you heard that dirty joke you told Quagmire.
I'm not going to tell y'all that one here at the workplace.
Look, you blade, just tell us who you heard it from.
It turned out the joke already had quite a history.
Tucker heard it from Bender on Futurama, oddly enough, for some reason.
REO Speedwagon saved us several stops, as they, too, had backtracked the joke to some extent.
But when their trail had led to a bartender in Virginia, they had given up, much the way the world had given up on them.
In fact, just to kick them a couple extra bucks, here's five seconds of Time for Me to Fly.
Don't be stupid. Somebody had to have made it up.
Besides, this will be way more fun than hanging out in Maine with the wives, sitting around a campfire, listening to Lois tell grocery stories. Oh, Peter, you should have been there. Uncle Ben's converted brown rice was on sale.
Whatever-- I don't know how much rice is, but you know what I'm saying.
Say, ladies, I was wondering if you could tell me-- what was childbirth like?
Think of the most intense pain you've ever felt, and imagine feeling that for hours.
They didn't think I was far enough, but I was like, I can tell you I'm far enough.

MAN ON TV: We now return to Aaron Sorkin 's new show, The Kitchen.
Walk with me. I want you to get some milk.
What, are we in Iraq? This happens entirely too often.
Yeah, Dad. Remember the last time you told us the story of Star Wars?
Once upon a time, Christina Ricci was all tied up for some reason...
Yeah, Dad. Isn't there another story like Star Wars you could tell us?
Echo 3 to Echo 7. Han, old buddy, you read me?
Luke, I thought we talked about this. I changed my code name.
Okay, but be careful. There's some snow monsters out there.
Hey, you guys, I hate to do this to you, but I gotta get out of here.
Hey, what's that on your jacket? Is that the Purina logo?
Han, wait. I thought you said you were gonna stay.
Sorry, I can't. But I'll give you my email address.
Yes, there is a lot of ice around here. We get it.
SOLDIER: What? Why would I need ice? We're surrounded by...
You don't want me to leave because of the way you feel about me.
I bet you're afraid I'm gonna leave without giving you a goodbye kiss.
Beep-boop-beep. I like all these electrical wires just nailed to the ice.
All right, I'm gonna go out and look for him. I'll take my Don Don.
You can't go out there in this weather. Your Don Don will freeze.
You knucklehead. Get out of here, but know I love you.
Me was going to ask you to snow monster ball, but now forget it!
Why don't I get you a nice hot bowl of Zima soup?
You will go to the Dagobah system and learn the ways of the Force from Yoda.
Last time I was in a Dago bar I was drinking a beer in Little Italy.
Well, I can't stand this cold anymore. I'm gonna die.
There are way too many elderly comedians out here in the snow.
This may smell bad, kid, but it'll keep you warm.
Captain Solo, do you copy? This is Overweight Pilot Number One.
I'm sorry, I didn't copy that. Who are you looking for?
Just as soon as I grab some powder with these skiing young people.
MAN: (SINGING) Get your skis shined up Grab a stick of Juicy Fruit
The taste is gonna move ya when you pop it in your mouth
The taste, the taste, the taste is gonna move ya
You look strong enough to pull the ears off Jennifer Garner.
Well, your managed-to-keep-me-around- a-little-longerness, it looks like you managed to keep me around a little longer.
I assure you, I had nothing to do with it.
I think you just can't stand to let a fat guy like me out of your sight.
You can't use that word! Only we can use that word!
Come here. Come on. Come on, bring it in. Come on. Come on.
Hug it out, yeah. Spray that hug all over me.
What? I just wanna share my throbbing emotions and shoot hot hug all over you.
Hey, what'd you end up doing with that dog we kidnapped?
Lord Vader, we've entered the Hoth system, but the Rebels have put up an energy shield blocking our entry.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah. I had that problem with a chick the other night.
Okay, gross. I'm gonna turn around and take care of this other guy.
Didn't know I could choke you through the TV, did you?
That's not in the budget. You know, we're trying to catch Rebels here.
I don't even have business cards. None of us do.
There's like a million of you. What do you need business cards for?
(CHUCKLING) That chocolate chip cookie looks like the Death Star.
We're evacuating into outer space, with literally infinite directions in which to flee.
However, we have decided that our transports will travel directly toward the fleet of Star Destroyers.
Is there someone from the military we can talk to? A man, perhaps?
I feel like I could take on the whole Empire myself.
Unless they've got any big, giant robot camels, I think we're okay.
Yes, Lord Vader, their shield will be down in moments.
No cleaning while I'm doing the hologram... Shut that off!
Mr. Darth, you no have no more Windex on Star Destroyer.
Well, that's not my problem. Why dont you go out and buy some?
What if I give you the money, then you can go out and buy it?
FEMALE VOICE: On Star. What is the nature of your emergency?
Yeah, I just got laser torpedoed by an Imperial walker and I need roadside assistance.
(SLURRING) I love you guys. We had a great summer.
Well, I just realized that my spaceship works better when I have the keys.
MAN ON PA: Imperial troops have entered the base. Imperial troops have...
Sorry, I dropped the thing. Imperial troops have entered the base.
Geez, Gordon, maybe today wasn't the day to wear your mesh stormtrooper shirt.
Sorry, it's just... I'm going out dancing after work tonight.
Oh, my God, I can't remember the last time I went out dancing.
I think it was Memorial Day, like, two years ago.
It was on Alderaan. That's how long ago it was.
Are those guys getting away? We should probably get those guys.
This bucket of bolts is never gonna get us past that blockade.
Plus, me and Chewie are on it. Ain't that right, Chewie?
You may not remember, but I told you last week
I mean, as long as she knows you were here...
Look, this is happening, so just come to peace with it.
Hi, yeah, do you know how to get to the Dagobah system?
Yeah, actually we're headed there now. You can follow us.
Okay, great. Annoying question. We have to get gas, would you mind pulling off and waiting for us while we do that?
JOHN BUNNELL: This Rebel lawbreaker thinks he can outrun the Empire.
They give him a wide berth, but they don 't let him out of their sight.
Astonishingly, the driver makes a left, right into an asteroid field.
What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field.
Well, it's either that or go into the strawberry fields.
Hey, you know what I'm getting into? Is one-legged chicks.
Sir, the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field are two to one.
Look at that one! Look at that one there! Look at that other one!
Look, we got four or five of the main characters on this ship.
Doesn't that pie look good? Too bad we can't get at it.
I'm just going on record as saying I'm not comfortable with this.
I've just found that Leia's constant questioning of me has not been productive to the atmosphere of the ship.
And I think that she just needs to get some respect for herself.
The last half hour, I've been having all pee dreams.
All the scopes are dead! I can't see a thing!
Sorry, that's me. I was still using an electronic device.
Okay, that's much better. Now I can see the swamp... The swamp!
But the good hands people at Allstate will make sure you have a soft landing.
I'm okay, but the midget inside me's got a head concussion.
I think so. Boy, who knows what else is in this swamp?
You're the one that Obi-Wan sent me here to find.
No, I will not teach you the ways of the Force.
But if you want to become a Jedi, first I gotta ask you something.
No! No, no, no, no, no! We got a lot of training to do.
I'm asking, did you see the DVD frat house edition with all the uncensored footage and the interview with Ryan Reynolds?
It starts with checking out sweet-ass DVD releases, like Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau.
Yeah, he puts himself in his own movies, but you don't mind
'cause he seems like the kind of guy who'd help you move if you asked him.
I'm glad you're here. Look, I pulled this all apart, and it looks like you're gonna need a new condenser.
Yeah, and I would also highly recommend a complete flush of your photon conversion system.
Okay, well, how about this? Do you want me to just go ahead and do that while I'm replacing the new condenser?
You buy the condenser, and I'll make out with you.
I'm gonna kiss you so hard, the picture's gonna change into something else.
Look, this isn't Windex but it's just as good. It's the store brand.
I'm going to the knee pad. I'm gonna call you from the knee pad.
I'm gonna need you to find him and turn him.
Really? Maybe I can make him go bi, but all the way is gonna be tough.
I have all the skills I need to make it in the real world.
The Empire GI Bill helped me finish school. Hey, wait up!
And I met my wife in the service. We had our honeymoon on Alderaan.
RECRUITMENT ANNOUNCER: The Empire, chasing Rebel scum, killing Luke's aunt and uncle, telling people to move along.
That's good. Stretch it out, stretch it out because we're gonna start the training.
I'm ready, Master Yoda. I'm ready to become a Jedi.
You know, I'm up for this, but it kind of feels like the dark side has a better gym than us.
How come I never get any lines in these things?
All right. Let's take a break. Your back's getting all sweaty.
Correct. I also would've accepted the rotting old woman in The Shining, but Kathy Bates is probably worse. Best scene in Teen Wolf?
When Michael J. Fox is in the bathroom, turning into a werewolf for the first time and his dad's knocking on the door and he is freaking out and he opens the door and his dad's a werewolf, too.
I would've also accepted the scene at the end, at the basketball game, where the guy in the crowd has his dick out.
Go online. Look it up. He's in the stands, way in the background, and he's totally got his dick out.
But it's very confusing and it stops the movie dead.
You know, I guess we should take advantage of this very rare opportunity.
Let's see, we got Robot Guy, Old Timey Deep Sea Diver Looking Guy,
Lizard Guy, who I think I saw get in a fight with Captain Kirk,
Okay, get ready to go to light speed. One, two, three.
Oh, my God! You have cake? Where'd you get cake?
It was Jim's birthday, but I think it's all gone.
They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking device.
Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit of the Millennium Falcon.
Yeah, and even if they don't, where are we gonna hide out after this?
In fact, I think he might be the only black guy in the galaxy.
Chewie, get ready to release the landing claw and we'll float away with their garbage. Release!
Oh, my God, I hit a space bum! Chewie, go, go, go, go!
I see a woman draining your bank account and running off with a real estate agent.
And I see my friends. They're in trouble! I gotta save them!
Wait, wait, wait. Luke, that's a stupid idea. You're not done with all your Force stuff.
I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
And this is my special friend, Leia. And that's Sarge over there.
You don't know my name, do you? You never bothered to learn it.
I was just gonna introduce you, C-3PO. Why didn't you let me, C-3PO?
I got into a slap fight with a prep droid over a pair of cargo shorts.
I don't know, the time change is really hitting me.
I might just stay in the room and watch bad TV.
Geez, it's only like two hours earlier on Hoth. What's the big deal?
Please come in. I have nothing to say to Lando.
Okay, the door's gonna open and you guys say, Freeze, and point your guns at them.
DARTH VADER: Very well, Solo, if you won't talk, we have very effective means of torture.
All right, Luke's on Dagobah, there's a Rebel base on Kashyyyk, and I'm the one who clogged the toilet on the 16th floor.
You know, because of that, I had to use the little pig people's bathroom.
DARTH VADER: This facility should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his trip to the Emperor.
And as long as we're freezing things, why don't you toss this ice cube tray full of orange juice in there?
Chewie, you have to take care of the princess while I'm gone.
Okay, so, no cutting off body parts. Let's make that a rule.
No below the belt, if you know what I'm saying.
You know, let's not have one of those kinds of lightsaber battles.
Nice work, fellas! And, David, you sold the most magazine subscriptions, so you get to invite four of your friends to a pizza party.
Oh, no. We've lost Han. They're taking him to Jabba's palace.
Well, even though we know exactly where he's going, we should rescue him in three years.
I would give my right hand for this day to just end.
Let me see if I can do something about that.
FEMALE VOICE: Oh, God! Nobody's touched me like that for so long.
Thank God you're home, honey. He tried to rape me.
Oh, man. How am I supposed to run with this?
Come on, Luke, join the dark side. It's really cool.
Me, the Emperor, this guy Scott. You'll meet him, he's awesome.
I'll be your friend if you let me kick your ass.
Well, that's fine, but I don't see how that affects...
Join me and we can rule the galaxy as father and son!
You know? I mean, it doesn't have to be as father and son, it can just be as, you know, as two really close guys who just happen to be men, you know?
Just two good-looking guys sharing a cramped office, running the galaxy together, you know?
Maybe we'd do it occasionally, but it's not weird, you know,
'cause we're just two guys with raging goals, you know?
I mean, it's not even about the doing it part, but that's a part of it, but it's not the whole thing.
Luke. Turn the ship around. I know where Luke is.
What, are you out of your mind? What about those fighters?
Oh, my God! This is so stupid, I was trying to call Luke Adams.
His number is right next to yours in my helmet.
And, you know, the offer's still open for the whole two dudes running the galaxy plan.
All right. Well, I'll talk to you later, Luke Skywalker, right?
Prepare to lock the tractor beam onto the Millennium Falcon.
Don't worry, we'll find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, and we'll get Han back.
Lando is wearing Han's clothes in this scene. It's really weird.
Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.
CHEWIE: There he goes with that crap again. Keep it in church, man.
ARTOO: Someday, I'm gonna buy my moms a place with a view like this.
A letter. Dear Luke, if my calculations are correct, you should receive this letter at the exact moment the DeLorean vanished. I have been living happily for the past six months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that...
I mean, he's in the Old West, but he's alive!
Actually, I think they did a pretty good job of that already, Dad.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it. I don't watch Comedy Central.
It's on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, Dad. I'm pretty sure you know that.
I don't know that. I haven't seen that show in a while and I don't know that anyone else has.
I think plenty of people have. Their fans are pretty loyal to them.
(SIGHS) I'm not gonna let you get to me this time, Dad.
Oh, I can't wait to see all my old classmates.
This is gonna be so much fun, isn't it, Peter?
Oh, sure, it's a blast being in a room full of people you don't know.
Look, I'm just not wild about the idea of running into anybody you used to date, that's all.
Wait, you mean, you two used to, you know, bump japanese cartoon monkey logo mouth.
Well, let's just say Naomi and I experimented quite a bit in college.
Oh, it's great to see you too, Lois. It really is.
You know, the fact is I came here hoping to run into you.
You see, I'd like to propose something to you and your husband.
It's just something I was wondering if you and your husband would participate in.
Well, as long as I'm dreaming I might as well pee my pants.
Well, Naomi, whatever it is, I'm sure we'd be happy to help.
We now return to Nature with a guy named Terry in it.
While the strongest made the kill, the oldest will eat first.
All right, come on, guys, she's gonna be here any minute.
Cause you daddy is gonna have a three-way with your mother and her friend.
Peter, you are not gonna be having a three-way with Lois and her friend.
She just had that one experience in college with that girl Naomi.
Because Naomi will be here shortly, and I'm anxious to get started.
What do you mean? We don't even know why she's coming.
You picked up those tearaway panties like I texted you?
Dale! All right, I guess, but I'm doing you last.
All right, you guys, I've got a few porn scenarios for you to choose from
Peter, what the hell are you doing? Knock it off.
We brought you some wine. But it's best chilled before dinner.
Oh, you have to excuse my kitchen, I've been cooking all...
Girls, I've just finished grading your midterms, and it's not good news.
Looks like you're gonnna have to do some extra credit.
Why don't I get you seated in the dining room and then we'll pour the wine.
There's only one way you're not getting on that train.
And so I went into corporate finance and that's where I met Dale.
Six months later I was asking her to marry me.
All right, we're running out of time. Are we going to get this orgy started or what?
Are we going to get this orgy started or what?
Oh my god. You thought that's what we're here for?
Well, Dale and I found out that we can't have children.
We've conceived many times, but for some reason the eggs won't attach.
And it was suggested that I find a healthy woman who would considered carrying our child to term.
Oh my god. You want me to carry your child?
All right, Peter, I don't know what this is about, but you're my best friend and I'd like to think that you do the same for me.
Wait a minute, so you guys can't have a baby?
I mean... I mean which one of you has the thing that's horribly wrong with them.
Dale, it's you, isn't it? You've got a bum dong.
I've given this long and careful thought and I decided to carry Naomi and Dale's child for them.
You'll have my stool in your eye, that's all you'll get.
Look, I know it's an inconvenience, but it's a wonderful gift to be able to give someone, so I am going through with it.
Well, I support you, Lois. I think it's great what you're doing.
She's doing something wonderful for a couple who can't have their own children and are too egoitistical to adopt.
Lois, I don't want you walking around all pregnant for nine months, just to hand over that thing when it comes out like a hen to a farmer.
Because they need a healthy female body to carry the baby.
It was hard enough on your body when you gave birth to Stewie.
But really, Meg, you don't know anything about this stuff.
You've never even had a boyfriend more than a few weeks.
No, you are not, Lois. I'm sorry, but I forbid it.
Oh, and I'm supposed to blindly go along with everything you decide for the both of us?
Just like I co-exist with the tiny race of people who live in our carpet.
They're playing music so that I will bless them with food.
Lois, Dale and I just want to thank you again.
Well, I wish my husband felt the same way you do, but...
Now, Mrs. Griffin, you should understand, a procedure like this is not without its risks.
For example, here's what happened, when we fertilized an egg from Shelly Duvall with a sperm from James Blunt.
I got more funny ones, I got Tina Fey and Joaquin Phoenix.
Okay. So, the eggs have already been fertilized by means of intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
The insertion procedure will be performed by these south-american Hovitos blow gunners.
Wait a minute, I don't want them shooting things into my vagina.
Well, clearly she believed that it was within her right...
And if I'm gonna do something about it, it's gonna be now.
The house is a dangerous place for today's modern woman.
Lois, I've hired some to do their routine on your stomach.
Peter, come on! I'm having this baby and that's the end of it.
But Lois, if they do it good enough, they'll save the rec center from being torn down and replaced by some mall.
Run, 80s black guys. You are no match for the 90s black guys.
Lois, I bet I can drink more Bleach than you.
I know you are not happy about this, but I am pregnant, and I am having this baby.
You'll be fat and cranky, and your boobs will get bigger, and you'll stop having your period.
And besides, it's just nine months, then everything will be back to normal.
A devastating pile-up on I-95 has injured eight people and killed two others.
Naomi and Dale Robinson were pronounced dead on arrival at Quahog hospital.
Lucky Quahog resident Dale Robinson has hit the jack... Oh boy.
Like those cats you see in the special animal Olympics.
So, Whiskers, how does it feel to finally win your event after years of training?
I mean, we can't afford nine months of medical bills.
Well, there is no harm in visiting the family planning center just to see what your options are.
Lois, do I need to do anything tomorrow that doesn't involve me being bent over in excruciating pain three feet from a toilet?
And you should ask as many questions as you can before you decide.
You strap it down and then go hacking that like Sweeney Todd?
Okay, what, so you go stab it in there with a laser and you try to zap it out?
What? So what? You like hold her legs open and like send a pitbull in there?
And then he comes back out with it in his mouth and he goes...
You know, you can't get it away from him, cause, you know, it's his thing.
No. Mr. Griffin, it's a very simple safe procedure, in which we very precisely and delicately remove the embryo.
We do it all the time and I promise it's virtually risks-free.
Well, I have to say I feel a little better about it.
I think this may be the right thing to do.
I'm gonna go sit in the car  and pretend like I'm driving.
Sir, we are doing all that we can to stop the killing of millions of unborn babies.
If you have a few moments, I'd like you to watch this video presentation.
Yeah, I got a few minutes, my wife is getting an abortion.
But before you do, remember: science has proven that within hours of conception a human fetus has started a college fund and has already made your first Mother's Day card out of macaroni and glitter.
I'm looking forward to being an active member of your community.
Because even though they are not visible yet, you already have tiny arms.
Arms, that will one day work, play and fold in prayer.
Just like so many other promising human lives, who were probably snuffed out by abortion.
And did you know the baby you aborting may also have a baby inside of it that you're also aborting?
Now that you know this do you want an abortion?
Bless you, sir. You should be very proud of yourself.
Oh, I am! Prouder than when I was a peacock.
If god wanted us to kill babies, he'd make them all Chinese girls.
That's what the man I've just met outside the clinic told me.
But according to the law, it is still my right to choose what I do with my body.
Okay, Peter, if you're so pro-life, let me ask you this.
Would you go down to the orphanage and claim an unwanted baby and take care of it?
Once they get out of vagina, they can go *** themselves.
Peter, what's inside of Lois won't be remotely human for six months.
There's no brain activity until at least the 27th week.
Maybe she should have thought of that before she asked me for directions.
You know how cousin Lou has that kid who's eyes touch.
So what, you're saying Toucheyes eyes doesn't deserve to exist?
Well, you don't mind him when you want a needle threaded.
I'm just saying that they should have at least have the option.
Think of all the love he's given to uncle mom and aunt dad.
Peter, what if carrying the baby to term would endanger the mother's life?
What if you look at the ultrasound and see that the baby is gonna be born with no arms and no legs?
I am going back to that clinic and I am having that abortion.
Lois, you go down there, and I'll blow that place up.
Oh, so what? You-you kill a bunch of doctors to show that the killing is wrong?
And we would not gonna solve anything by standing here and screaming at each other.
And whatever we decide, we both have to agree that it's the right thing to do.
Now I say we go upstairs and have a long talk.
And we don't come down until we've made a decision that we both can live with.
There's diapers, and crying, and late nights with no sleep.
Flu shots, and mumps, and drivers ed, and college tuition...
It's a one more person to share the world with.
Another little voice in a back seat of the car.
One more Griffin to love and to love us in return.
World War II Army Guy-- a letter from your gal.
All right, at ease, at ease. Dear Willy, it's been awful lonesome since you've been away.
We got invited to a party. Peter Griffin, you and your family are cordially invited to a gala dinner in your honor at Rocky Point Manor.
Who cares? It says here it's for the whole weekend.
Oh, well, then maybe we just go, and you go to the kennel.
Or ten years, I don't know-- there's no clock there!
Well, we got an invitation to a dinner in my honor.
I assumed it was for all those arrests I made last month.
That's weird. My invitation said it was in  my honor.
I assumed it was for being able to fart the alphabet, which I almost did till I pooped on the S.
Oh, well. Everybody on the bus was upset long before that anyway.
I got a card that says they're throwing a dinner in my honer.
Muriel, if you're not gonna eat your half of the cheeseburger,
I'll see if they have a freezer, so I can keep it nice.
You know, you-- we-- you and I see each other from time to time.
Oh, my God, we, like, never see each other! This guy!
You, like, disappear for a month, and then you call me?!
Okay, why don't you go ahead and take the bags in.
Wow, it-- it looks like the whole town got invited.
If you will all please follow me to third floor,
Everyone got invitations from an anonymous source for a dinner in their honor, when that's clearly not the case.
Well, at least you all had eveningwear provided for you.
I thought this was going to be a lawn party.
I don't know, are you a pony or the color blue?
Channel Five news has file footage of pills being sorted.
Some people think Jennifer Connelly's old now, and that her hands look like two bags of snakes.
Of course she does! I performed her very first pelvic exam!
I'd like to introduce you to my lovely companion, Pricilla.
No, his last name is Woods, but he's not made of wood.
This truly is a night to celebrate, especially for me.
The invitation said this was a dinner in my honor.
She came into my life as if out of nowhere, enchanted me beyond my wildest dreams, and opened my eyes to the cleansing truth of Jesus Christ's love.
Um... what does all this gay stuff have to do with us?
Well, the fact of the matter is, I have wronged each and every one of you in some way.
And, since I am a man of God now, I am truly repentant.
I understand that there is some healing to do here tonight, and I am prepared to be patient.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go check on dinner.
I don't know, maybe we should give him a chance.
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Maybe if I sit in his chair, I can get a reading on his energy.
I mean, if he's an Aquarius, a rebirth would not be unexpected.
You know, it's like when I did Glenn's star chart...
I can't help feeling this would be sadder if she wasn't heavy.
Jeez, I knew he was crazy, but I didn't think he was a murderer!
Oh, he must've brought us here to kill us all!
I thought that-that might be a fun thing to do.
Storm has flooded the causeway, and the bridge is destroyed.
We can't just stay here with James Woods lurking somewhere in the house!
Oh, no. You know, I wouldn't feel right about that.
Look, everybody but Chris, just keep your pants on and let's figure a way out of this.
I was going to the bathroom, and I just couldn't stop looking at my penis,
You think you can just commit murder and get away with it?!
Well, maybe that dead pile of cookie dough in the next room will refresh your memory.
Where is she, Woods? What'd you do with the body?
I'll admit it, I'm-I'm not great with that stuff sometimes.
All right, I don't know what's happening here, but look, I'm a lot of things.
A member of Mensa, a huge hit with the ladies, someone who, you know, would have broken out bigger if he weren't so impossible to work with.
If I were you, I'd keep your mouth shut till you talk to a lawyer.
So James Woods murdered Stephanie, and then he murdered himself.
This gun was timed to fire directly at that chair, where James Woods would have been sitting.
But he left, and Stephanie was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
So whoever the murderer is, they were after James Woods, not Stephanie.
Let's look around and see if we can find any more clues.
Brian, I feel like everyone's wondering why I'm wearing shorts.
The fact that no one has said anything makes it even more obvious that everyone has noticed.
All right, since it's my fault that Joe got knocked out, it is now my responsibility to take over the investigation.
The gun was clearly meant to kill James Woods, but Stephanie got in the way.
So the murderer had to improvise and finish the job by stabbing him.
Now who here had a motive for wanting James Woods dead?
But he wronged one of us enough to want revenge.
And I booked the lead role in Nightmare On Elm Street.
And now this Robert Englund is the talk of the town.
Aye. He's the one who made me what I am today.
I wish you were a real, live ornery sea captain.
No. Actually, I was a normal guy until one night, we dropped acid together, and he thought I was a steak.
It was a whole thing. But I'm not the killer!
He could have killed him and got himself off scot-free!
He took the Twitter name Mayor West, so now I have to use Mayor underscore West.
I tell you, that guy looks like a dog turning 30.
I heard him complaining about Woods in the dining room.
Why don't you come over to my place for a glass of wine and a couple of fruit pies, and then we can go in the back room and play crazy snake. Hee-hee-hee!
Go to hell! I backed out of that project willingly.
James Woods made a list of all his misdeeds so he could make amends.
Bonnie, he punched you in the throat, and that's why you sound like that?
No, he punched me in the throat because I sound like this.
One day, I bring my nephew to work, and he molest my nephew, and my nephew-- he only 14, and he cry, and then, he shoot himself in the face.
Says here he talked Muriel into selling him OxyContin for him and his 19-year-old girlfriend.
This went on for weeks, but then she started to have misgivings and threatened to cut him off.
He threatened to blackmail her by turning her in to the Feds.
And I am not saying another word until I talk to my lawyer, because...
Well, as long as there's a murderer on the loose, none of us are safe.
We-we-we were gonna use this time, uh... to figure out what to get you for your birthday.
Um, okay, um, Meg, you go with Carl. Sorry, Carl.
Joe and Priscilla are still passed out, so they'll be the unconscious team.
And that leaves one three-person team of Mort, Consuela, and Mayor West.
Hey, maybe it was that cat who was the murderer.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have papers to correct.
If I should die, I-I just want you to know that they might find some things.
And I just want you to know, from me, it's all gonna be out of context.
It means, if I die, you got to burn my house down!
Oh, so I'm not supposed to point out when you do something stupid?
She could be hiding behind any one of these statues.
Muriel, this is Tom Tucker from the Channel Five news.
So, um, in the bear world, are, like, pandas your version of interracial children?
Why do I still get guy in an elevator small talk?
I don't know. You're the one talking about the weather.
I should just check the Find A Jew app on my phone.
Huh. There's just two big clusters on each side of the country.
I have no idea. d Linda Evans and John Forsythe d d They're coming down big, long stairs d d Come on, Brian, you know this d d We're all rich d d And we're all at least in our late 50s d d Think Joan Collins d d Come on, Brian, you know this d d It's the middle trumpet part d d It was a pretty big deal for Diahann Carroll d d To play a rich, black woman in the 80s. d
Look! This is the same knife that killed James Woods.
If we don't find out before this storm lets up, we're all gonna be dead by morning.
All right, if we're going to make it out alive, we got to stick together from now on.
I fell through a trapdoor that led to an underground passageway.
So I followed it, and it led me to a hatch over there in the parlor.
I was standing in the foreground gng like this when Jillian took the picture, so by forced perspective, it looks like I'm holding up the whole sign.
I don't believe you. I think you are a god.
If I can get up to the roof or something, maybe I can get a stronger signal and call the police.
Okay. And I will skin this dog in your honor.
All right, nobody leaves this room until he gets back.
She was still passed out on the couch when we left.
This is all speculation! We don't know she's the killer!
Look at this-- he's been hit on the head by a blunt object.
We thought Muriel was the killer, and look how that turned out.
She's right! There was a Golden Globe award here, and it's gone.
So all we have to do is find that Golden Globe and we'll have our murder weapon-- and if we're lucky, it may just mean we'll have our killer.
All right, from this moment forward, nobody leaves the group.
Good. Now, we're gonna search the house, and we're gonna move as one.
Anyone who separates from the group we will assume to be the killer.
Well, I think we've learned a little something about our friendly neighborhood policeman today.
All right, we got to search every one of these rooms.
Looks like the crotch got chewed on by a walrus mouth.
Come on, guys, can't we all just be glad she's dead?
Yes. It helps me get to sleep, knowing that Big Tom Tucker is keeping a watchful eye out for nocturnal intruders.
Look, I didn't know my room was gonna be scrutinized.
I-If you don't like it, let's get out of here.
I suppose it crawled under your bed all by itself.
Like hell I am! You're not taking me anywhere, you podunk, Quahog redneck cop!
What do we do? Wait a minute, wait a minute, guys!
Shoot. What if half of us go around one side of the table, and the other half go around the other side, and then we won't have to chase him around in circles.
It sure is, but at this point I'm willing to try anything.
Just for that, when the movie of this story comes out,
I guess that means you don't want anyone to see it.
I feel like a lot of people were looking at me like I was really attractive.
Which makes me think that I'm gonna grow up to be good-looking.
What part of that statement is supposed to lure me into a conversation?
Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels in the bath... L-Lois?
Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels in the bathroom?
Okay, well, I don't see the fire engine, but I guess we'll just find out when we get home, won't we?
It's just... so hard to believe you can work with someone for 15 years and yet have no idea who they really are or what they're capable of.
She actually bought me this blouse for my first solo broadcast.
I mean, how could she have known you'd be anchoring alone?
Gosh, I, uh, you know, I think I'd better, uh... go make sure Peter has his, uh... fire engine.
God, why do I ever try to be friends with other women?
Well, I suppose it all really began a year ago when James Woods and I met at a press event and began seeing each other.
We both valued our privacy, however, so we agreed to keep it a secret from the media.
It was hard for me to begin with, but it got worse when, not so coincidentally,
Tom began pushing Channel Five News to replace me with a fresh, young face, and he succeeded.
Well, apparently, all men think the same way, because around the same time,
I watched my career and my love life crumble, and I wasn't gonna just stand by and take it.
That's when I had the good fortune to meet a young news intern named Priscilla.
She was so anxious to get into the reporting business and would have done anything to get on my good side.
I paid her off to seduce James Woods and reel him into a relationship like a fish on a line.
I knew a hot, young woman like Priscilla could manipulate him into doing anything I wanted.
At my direction, she persuaded him to become a born-again Christian, and instilled him with the drive to bring together all the people he'd wronged.
Of course, Priscilla knew nothing of my real intentions, but she played the part beautifully, nonetheless.
I planned to kill James Woods and frame Tom Tucker, thereby destroying the two people who cast me aside and ruined my life.
The hidden gun goes off, kills James Woods, and at the first opportunity,
I retrieve the gun and plant it in Tom's bag.
And when I realized my mistake, I had to improvise.
I grabbed the knife off the dinner table and stabbed him.
So when Tom and I got separated in the gallery,
I went back into the dining room and got the knife.
I knew I couldn't risk her revealing that I had engineered this whole gathering... so I killed her.
I tried to plant the knife in Tom's suitcase, but at that moment,
It wasn't her fault, poor thing, but she had to die.
I had to leave the knife in her, because I couldn't very well hide it on my person with everyone quickly closing in.
I slipped in with the rest of the group, when they all converged on the scene.
I needed more time to finish my work framing Tom.
I couldn't let him contact the police before everything was in the place.
When Peter was yelling at everyone about that picture of Derek holding up the Hollywood sign,
I followed Derek outside and did what I had to do.
I barely had enough time to plant the Golden Globe in Tom's room and run back downstairs, where I took advantage of the commotion and joined the crowd as they were all running outside.
And the rest... well, you did all the rest for me.
But wait, there's one thing unaccounted for-- what happened to Stephanie's body?
Well, actually, Lois and I were just about to go for a quick walk, weren't we, Lois?
I'm not, I'm just asking for the key. Give me the key.
Please recognize when I'm acting out of the ordinary because I'm in danger.
We been married 14 years. She never called me Pete.
Why am I trying to figure this out when I could be listening to my tapes in the car?
Well, it's a shame that you have to die, Lois, but look on the bright side:
If anybody's gonna take that bitch down, it's gonna be me.
So you can see all the stuff on the sides that you couldn't before.
She was shot by an unknown assailant, after she herself committed a series of gruesome murders.
In local news, there was a hit-and-run by a drunk driver today at Quahog Park.
It says here that Rush Limbaugh will be signing books at the Quahog Mall.
But I thought Rush Limbaugh is a fictional character played by Fred Savage.
You saw it with your own eyes and then you reported it on Fox News.
Even true things, once said on Fox News, become lies.
Don't they have bookstores at the Nazi fascist... fascist fat camp where he, where he go-- where he, where he is a counselor?
I tell you what, Brian, if you want, we'll give you another crack at that.
This guy single-handedly set political discourse back a hundred years.
You know what? I'm gonna go down there and give that bastard Limbaugh a piece of my mind.
But first I'm gonna sit here and stare at this brown paper bag
I'm gonna go find some hardcover photography books of tasteful nudes.
Hey, my friend, who should I make this out to?
Listen, Limbaugh, my name is Brian Griffin, and I have got something to say to you.
Our republic has been bastardized and royally screwed up thanks to you jackasses.
Yes, uh, valid points you're raising, my friend, and I respect you for raising them.
But I've read things other people have written about the things you've written, and I do not approve of the things I've read from others about the things they've read from you.
Oh, no. It's a multiracial TV gang, including white guys.
Let's beat him up, but not because of his color,
Ah, it was nothing. I mean, you'd have done the same thing for me.
What-What if I stick a piece of bologna in the book, and I don't tell you which page?
Would you read it to find the page with the bologna?
Okay, look, I'll read four pages of your book tonight.
And maybe more if tonight's episode of The Office ends up sucking.
RAINN WILSON: I know my staplers by sound and by weight.
Aw, but there were gonna be more high jinks in Scranton.
I-I can't believe I'm saying this, but this might be the best book I've ever read.
You know, I've never actually read any of Limbaugh's stuff, but this book makes an excellent case for personal accountability, fiscal responsibility and steak eatership.
And as a reasonable person, I reserve the right to change my mind when presented with new information that alters my perspective.
And I got to tell you, I had this guy all wrong.
I mean, some of the stuff in here is-- hey, bologna!
I'm not saying you'd have to be gay to drive something else.
But if you drive something else, you're probably a guy who likes to pleasure other men sexually.
I knew you'd like it, and I'm glad you enjoyed it, Brian, I really am.
I-I want to find the right words to describe how much I agree with you.
I got the words, Brian. Thank you, Rush, for doing my thinking for me, 'cause I lack the ability to think critically and independently. Yes, that!
Well, listen, I'd really love to pick your brain some more and hear some of your other thoughts about what's going on in this country.
Come on, I'm gonna introduce you to some of my pals here.
Oh, Rush and I used to solve mysteries together back in the day.
The groundskeeper said he saw the mummy burning the flag.
But I think it's time we unravel the mummy and the mystery.
Rush, I've never known a Democrat to pass up pork.
And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling Republicans.
Look, Brian, all I'm saying is, it's not normal for people to change their political views so radically overnight.
Lois, no offense, but you don't exactly know what you're talking about.
I mean, you're-you're not exactly a fountain of political knowledge yourself.
You want to know what I think is happening here?
I think you just got to be in the out group.
Whoever's on top, whoever's in power, whoever's successful, you got to be on the other side or you don't feel like the smartest guy in the room.
Oh, yeah? Let me ask, what did you think of the movie Titanic?
Cocktail was one of the best films of its era.
Look, Lois, if I were you, I'd stow that attitude, because Rush Limbaugh is coming over for dinner tonight.
Dear God who definitely exists, we, your people, who have been on this planet for 6,000 years and not a second more, wish to thank you for this bounty, and for keeping Congress predominantly white through Christ our Lord, amen.
So, Rush, I see you made it here okay, driving on roads built with public funds, by the government.
Too bad only the very rich can afford to use them.
Well, maybe more people could if the government wasn't taxing the bajeezus out of them.
I guess we can forget that whole global warming myth.
Global warming is not a myth, you son of a bitch!
Look, all I did was expose Brian to a different way of thinking.
I am seeing the world in a whole new way now.
The streets are aglow with the smell of apple pies
And babies come out of the womb in coats and ties...
We just take it and we jam it back inside
I'll bet you a buck y won't find a damn thing wrong
'Cause when you come down to it, this is where
Well, I got to tell you, I'm not buying any of this crap.
What are you saying? I don't have a mind of my own?
I don't, I don't like the way you've been talking to Rush this evening.
But if you can't accept me now that we disagree about certain things, then maybe you aren't the friends
Let's all just sit here for a moment and remember that this was a thing.
Hey, you know, I've been reading all your books and I so 100% agree with you.
I mean, these taxes, right? I mean, am I right?
Oh, yeah, I took the liberty of replacing your old one with a new, American-made coffee machine.
In fact, I got you a bunch of new, topnotch, American-made stuff.
Oh, a couple things: that light fixture... new heat regulator on your stove... your man-bra... your garbage disposal... your dishwasher... and your new cat.
I want to take a moment to give a shout-out to my good friend Ken Lay, faked his own death, listening in on a ham radio somewhere in international waters.
You strap her to a board, put a cloth in her mouth and pour water over it to simulate drowning.
And why don't we take a short break here, folks.
What the hell kind of show you think I'm doing here?.
And she's addicted to crack. Come on, you're with me on this.
Of course she's addicted to crack, but you can't just say that.
You got to lead people there with an intelligent argument so they arrive at it on their own.
Hey, come on, man. We got to tell people how it is.
Brian, look, there is no victory unless people know why they were wrong to disagree with you in the first place.
My-- right now my problem seems to be that I am talking to a Pelosi-lover.
I don't have to sit here and waste my time with a softie.
No, I'm here to strap you to a board, put a cloth in your mouth and pour water over it to simulate the sensation of drowning.
Yeah, I keep Strom Thurmond's corpse in the front seat so I can use the carpool lane. Oh.
I support the death penalty to show people that killing is wrong.
Look, I-I make a living persuading others to join my side.
But I'd never, ever want somebody to be something they're not.
I mean, what about that four-year-old that was executed in Texas?
Not really, but you see, Brian, your concern betrays you.
It's not a coincidence you turned your back on your democratic principles just when the Democrats became the political establishment.
Right there. See, the fact that you would give a woman credit for anything... it means you're a liberal, Brian.
It's time for you to spread your two left wings and fly.
Does this-- does this mean I'll never see you again?
Wherever there's a rich white guy in need of another tax break, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a brain-dead woman in need of expensive life support her husband doesn't want, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a country that needs to be invaded for reasons that don't exactly pan out, I'll be there, too.
I think you are a godless, socialist, pot-smoking, maggot-infested member of the blame-America-first crowd, and I think you want the terrorists to win.
Oh, Lois, I'm so glad you were able to make it to dinner tonight.
He's probably down at the dock tinkering with that darn yacht of his.
I wanted to bring, um, an owl on this trip, but Lois wouldn't let me.
Well, I suppose there's some room in the owlery, but I can't be certain.

Colgate Palmolive, Exxon Mobil, and a 20 I found in a blazer I wore to a wedding last year.
Tonight, on Ken Burns' nine-part series on street signs: Part Four: Yield.
OLD MAN: Before they had the sign, people just run into each other.
I don't know, maybe... Maybe you had to see the first three to get this, but I... I am completely lost.
Lois, you said there would be other men my own age here.
Look, Peter, why don't you just grab a book off the shelf and be quiet?
Only if it has a mirror at the end of it, and it says, How about you?
Oh, wow, look at these old photos of you and Dad.
This must be around the time you guys were first dating, huh?
BARBARA: It was one of those lovely, warm summer days by the shore.
BARBARA: My friend and I held our breath, wondering which one of us he was talking to.
Boy, you can take a punch, but at the same time, you cowered a little bit.
Now, let's kiss while the camera pans over to the drapes.
Unfortunately, that was the year the great war with Alaska broke out, and even Carter's lofty connections couldn't save him from the draft.
Carter nearly lost his life in the battle with the infamous, walrus-backed Nanookwaffe.
Carter never forgot to write to me daily to send his love along with a mix tape.
BARBARA: But after some months, the letters stopped coming, and I was certain he had perished.
So I took up with a young dandy named Rodginald.
He would bring me small chocolates and sit in my front parlor and pitch woo at me, taking my hand gently and singing from bended knee the popular songs of his youth.
I agreed that I would marry him forthwith, even though my heart still belonged to Carter.
I believe Rodginald knew this, and he even tried to strike me in the manner to which I had become accustomed.
Dear, sir, I respectfully urge you to prepare yourself for one devil of a skirmish!
I got a story about a fat guy who's starving and bored.
Look, Peter, if you're that hungry, go down to the dock and find Daddy, and we'll get dinner started.
She's gonna tell that sloppy old Spanish maid to do it.
And she will, but only because she needs money to pay for medicine for her prematurely overweight son Diabeto.
I mean, she looked at me while I did it to myself.
Just turn the Ms upside down and send them down here!
Now, look, Griffin, you better not breathe a word about what you saw here.
Hey, Billy, I was gonna have a party at the rectory this evening.
Do you like sacramental wine and mouse Russell Crowe movies?
Now, remember, you keep your mouth shut about what you saw.
You know how hungry a man gets after a day at sea.
Peter, for God's sake, you're always an embarrassment at the table.
You should've seen him when we had dinner with Paul McCartney's ex-wife.
Well, we were there the other night for dinner, and I caught him cheating with some bimbo.
Anyway, he told me not to tell anybody, but I'm having a real hard time not telling Lois.
An alliance blessed by God and hallowed by the community.
It wouldn't be fair to the historical framework of the institution.
But for those who do, and then turn their back on its long-standing convictions? Shame!
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what to do.
Y... You could probably get him to pay through the nose to keep your mouth shut.
Oh, man. He'd hate that even more than he hates sitcom two-parters.
Now either try that beer or dump it down the sink! Wait!
Oh! Now, I have to wait a whole week to find out if she gave in to peer pressure at that drinking party!
Griffin! What the hell are you doing in my house?!
Well, I was getting ready to watch a movie on your big TV, but first I thought I'd use your hot bubbly toilet.
Get the hell out of there, you son of a bitch!
Oh, no, no. No, you don't get to talk to me like that anymore.
Not unless you want me to blab about what happened on the yacht.
That's right, you're gonna start doing a lot of stuff for me.
PETER: That went exactly as I wanted it to go.
All right here's your Mike and Ikes with all the Ikes taken out.
I hope you were careful, 'cause I swear to God, if I find one Ike in there, I'm going straight to Babs.
Next, I want you to fly to France and tell French people that a good-looking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie.
(over loudspeakers): People of France, a good-looking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie, and your sirens sound like gay guys having a threesome.
I just want you to know this was a huge pain in the ass. Peter's New Catch Phrases, by Carter Pewterschmidt.
Also, I've been under the weather lately, so it may not be my best work. Shape up or show me your balls.
Oh, man, there are a lot of good ones here. Fire alarm? I am the fire alarm. Find your own beach house, Crabby. Put that in your office and frame it.
Did you get down to the one at the bottom there?
No, this one here. If you've got a problem, take it up with my butt.
You know, Lois, I've noticed Peter and Carter spending a lot of time together lately.
You know, I keep not laughing at The Big Bang Theory, and I figure it's got to be the television, you know?
TV this size... Forget it, it'll have me laughing till I got snots falling out of my nose.
(mechanically): Because Peter is the best and he is awesome and he makes better laser sounds than I do.
No, no, but I... I understand that this is bad.
Look, I think you're blowing this out of proportion, Carter.
You know, maybe the two of you splitting up is a blessing in disguise.
I mean, there are obviously some problems in your relationship.
Who knows, maybe some time apart could be just what you need.
Yeah, plus think of all the fun stuff you can do as a single guy.
Like... Like going to loud, awful bars and not being able to heart the mediocre-looking chick next to you say something stupid.
Come on, it's been fifty years since I've been on a date.
Well, how'd you get that chick on the boat, then?
Well, that was one of the girls their dad didn't get back.
Joe McCarthy was on a rampage looking for anything red.
Here, I got these off a web site that tells you good things to say when hot women walk by.
Um, I... I love getting trendy cupcakes in the middle of the day for no reason.
Hey, why don't you and your friend come join us over at our table?
Hello, ladies. My name is Carter, and I require a tremendous amount of calcium.
Hey, boy, boy, fetch me a John Barrymore and soda and three Myrna Loys for the women.
You jackass. Those women were coming on to you and you blew it.
Now we got to go to another club and start all over again.
You got a room full of chicks like that and you're thinking about Babs?
I had a moment of weakness, but I... I know now that I was wrong.
Look at them over there taking a group picture together.
You can tell by the way we're pressing our faces together.
All right, if I've learned anything from romantic comedies it's that the ex-wife always falls in love with her husband again after he befriends a little kid.
Oh! Oh! We... We got to get you to the hospital!
Now as soon as she sees you, you've got to do exactly what I...
There's only one man I know who drives a Duesenberg.
Oh, Babs, I don't wish to overwhelm you with my passions, but I must say this.
Do you think perhaps one day, if we should marry, that I could sit beside you?
If it's a row you want, I will cleave you in twixt!
Hang... Hang on, Carter, I think I know how to take this guy down.
Mrs. Pewterschmidt, Carter has something important to say to you.
Uh, Peter, I kind of want to do this on my own.
Cheating on you was the worst mistake of my life.
I kneel before you a frightened soul and a broken man.
Give me one more chance, and I pledge to place above you nothing... Not even myself...
I... I just don't know that they can fix what's done.
I know I can't do it overnight, but we can still have a lot of years together.
But at my age, I'm certainly not going to remarry either.
So, if you'd like to move back in and take things slowly, one step at a time,
I suppose I can give you the chance to earn my trust again.
That sounds like a lot of work. Go to hell!
Okay, but, I mean, y-you can't go out like that.
Well, yes, but, Chris, you can't just walk around in blackface.
Now, go upstairs and put on that Indian chief costume I bought you.
Oh, well, every Halloween, me, Joe and Quagmire do this thing where one of us is it, and then the other two of us nail the crap out of him with awesome pranks.
I'm Dick Pump, and I'd appreciate it if you hooligans didn't get your eggs all over my parcel.
All right, what this is has no name, so you can't have it.
All right, you undead bastards, time to send you back to hell!
They-they dress up in costumes, and they go around asking for candy.
Well, how do you not know that your reflection in the patio door isn't another dog?
You gonna go see three movies in a row so it seems like you're out doing something?
No, Mom. I'm going to my first big high school Halloween party.
But I'm a modern vampire duck who hangs around with Anna Paquin and drives around in a black Mercedes.
Brian, are you sure none of these are real monsters?
A Cornish game hen for you, a Cornish game hen for you.
Oh, but I hope he doesn't have some gross Jewish candy, like-like Rugelach or-or Hamentashen or-or Hachahachahacha.
My mother bought it for me, and I was worried it might be a tad banal, but if you big kids like it, then it must be pretty cool.
You can have the apple and the raisins and the cheese and crackers with the little red stick.
Well, that jerk dog from our patio door somehow got inside a hubcap.
I just wanted to alert the owner of the car.
What do you want me to do, Stewie? It's late.
Let's track down the punks who stole it and make them pay.
Ah, well, you know, Peter, it's all in good fun, right?
Wait, are they, are they the angry eye ones or the tired eye ones?
My grandfather was a pilot for the Imperial Air Force during World War Two.
Yeah, no, I heard you, he was a Karma Chameleon, but how-how come I never met him?
I thought we were gonna go to The Clam and get wasted.
And Halloween's got to be the worst night of the year to be a cop.
All you do is drive around, confiscate beer from teenagers and occasionally handcuff a drunk woman in a sexy costume.
How about we ride around with you and steal beer from teenagers?
This is my job, and I can't have you fooling around, getting into trouble.
Well, didn't you get lost in the grocery store last week?
I came in with my wife and now I can't find her!
My cousin went to a Halloween party and made out with a guy, and she's hideous.
If we wear our masks and we don't take them off for the whole party, the boys won't know who we are, and we'll have a better chance of hooking up.
Oh, yeah, I'm very in touch with my Asian roots.
You notice I take my shoes off whenever I enter my house.
I do five hours of math homework every night even though I'm no longer in school.
I was a very cute baby and now I'm a joyless adult.
All units, we've got a domestic disturbance at Fifth and Maple.
All right you guys, these domestic dispute situations can get pretty dicey, so I need you to stay in the car, okay?
All right, sir, sir, ma'am. I just need you to tell me clearly and calmly, what happened.
This whore gets her stubby little fingers into my wallet! That's larceny!
He puts one of those cigars in his mouth and he turns into a different person!
You call that a massage, with your baby carrot fingers?!
Stay away from me! You keep him away from me!
Of course they did, they ran like two miles for them.
You distract them, and I'll run up from behind and grab it.
I'll just go over there and calmly ask them to give back the candy.
Uh, listen, my friend, Stewie, he's just a baby, and you guys took his candy earlier.
What do you say you just give it back, and we all forget this ever happened?
All right, Brian, we're getting my candy back, and here's how it's gonna go down:
First, we track down those teenage hoodlums and kill them all.
Well, now I know how Peter feels when Mort steals his paper.
Okay, your turn to spin the bottle, guy dressed like Bill Clinton.
Yeah, this is the Air Force graveyard, where old military planes come to die.
That's the kind of plane my grandfather used to fly in the war. Cool.
Man, this thing looks like it still might be in working order.
Now, listen very closely, 'cause here's how it's gonna go down.
I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I think that was me.
Well, there's only one thing to do now: go to plan B.
Well, just have him return the candy and everything's fine.
Justin, you give this young man his candy back, right now.
Take Justin's bag of candy and pour it into Stewie's.
And if I think you're holding back on me, we're gonna have a serious problem.
Good. Now, go in your purse, take out $40 and put it in the bag.
Feels kind of like something I was meant to fly, you know.
I can feel my grandfather's Japanese blood coursing through my veins.
Oh, my God! Stop, Quagmire! I don't want to die.
That was for making me have sex with Joe, you sons of bitches.
Brian, you took me out on my first Halloween tonight, and you showed me an exciting time.
And for that, I'm going to let you pick out some candy from my bag. Oh, thanks.
And keep in mind, we can't use any actual brand names due to advertising concerns.
Right, okay, I'll have a Mr. Whip-o Bar, a Kooky Nut Pop, some Jim 'n M's, uh, a Zip Zap, a Choco Buddy, uh, a Sixty-Four- Thousand-Dollar Bar, a Notafinger and a Dawkin's Peanut Butter Disc.
Why do you and Meg smell like sweat and shame?
I hooked up with a chick tonight, and I am pretty darn proud of myself.
Hey, Chris, um, I was wondering if you'd like to come to my party tomorrow.
Why don't you open your presents while I cut the cake?
Oh, look, it's one of those cards where you can record your own message.
Yeah, it's this cool thing where girls in bikinis box each other.
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
We've reached that part of the evening when our house champion takes on all challengers.
Any of you lovely ladies like to try your hand in the ring?
Oh. Well, good thing I made this plaster mold of your hand and forearm.
I see a woman's hand and forearm at table eight!
We gonna pretend to hit each other for a while, then maybe kiss a little? Huh?
No matter what you do for the rest of your life, you'll always be garbage.
You know, she could make some serious money as a professional.
Oh, sure. Women's boxing is a rapidly growing part of the field.
Well, she did look like she knew what she was doin' up there.
Hey, Lois, congrats on winning that boxing match last night.
Honestly, I don't know what came over me last night.
It was just one of those crazy things that sort of happened after a few drinks.
I am not a boxer, and I'm not fighting anyone else.
I'll take you somewhere real fancy and romantic for dinner, just the two of us.
And in return, I get to try and convince you to fight.
Oh, gosh, I can't wait to see this fancy restaurant.
Here, put on these special eating gloves I bought you.
Why do I need to wear gloves to eat in a fancy restaurant?
Damn it, Peter. I told you, I don't want to be a boxer!
Hey, remember when I said I think it's hot when you wear a sports bra and gym shorts underneath your dress?
My idiot husband here booked this match without my knowledge--
Did you know where the Ukraine was 'cause of my globe?
It's how I feel when I burp really loud in an underground parking structure to assert my dominance.
All right, kids, I'm off to train at the gym.
I don't know, you've just never really been the aggressive type.
I know, Brian, but when I stepped into that ring--
It's like I tapped into this primal wellspring of pent-up anger that just needed to be released.
You will recall, last night, ere I drifted off into slumber with a nudie magazine betwixt my legs,
It was a simple message, yet it has gone unheeded.
Look, Lois, it just seems to me that this isn't necessarily the healthiest thing for a woman your age to be doing.
Brian, I'm 42, I'm in the prime of my life, and this is what I want right now.
At this point, you guys are being as irresponsible as I am!
Look, Peter, I don't think there's gonna be any fight.
I think this is a sign that maybe it's time to hang up the gloves.
Look, Lois, we're making a lot of cash with this boxing thing.
Everybody in Japan is either a ten-year-old girl or a monster.
The only reason I did this in the first place was 'cause of you! What do you mean?
Peter, sometimes you're so insensitive, and you make me so angry, I just want to clock you in the jaw.
Obviously, I can't do that, so boxing was an outlet.
Wait, you mean the reason you fight so good is...
Look, if you don't want to fight anymore, you don't have to.
A-And the truth is, I suppose I kind of got most of it out of my system anyway.
Is it cool if I tell your insurance that I gave you heart surgery?
Ladies and gentlemen, in honor of her retirement after 17 consecutive victories,
I'm also having a celebratory keg party back at my house later.
You can tell your parents that my parents will be there.
Thank you so much for coming, everyone, and thank you for always cheering me on at all my fights.
BRIAN: Her fists are so dangerous, she's not allowed to be a lesbian.
Of me! Look at these people, giving you a statue for fighting a bunch of bums!
If you're so great, why don't you prove it? Fight me!
Why don't you bring your pretty little self over to my apartment tonight, and I'll show you a real woman.
Now, you get your hands off my man before I break 'em off!
Coming up next, a boxing match where the fighters are bleeding before the fight?
We're here live with contender Deirdre Jackson outside her dressing room.
Deirdre, is it true you've killed three women in the ring?
Let's just say you don't want to miss round six.
What? Why not? Because if you step into that ring, she's gonna kill you.
Look, Lois, you don't have to do this for me.
I know I make you mad sometimes, but I thought we agreed you'd hang up the gloves.
I'll hang up the gloves after I knock her ass out.
Peter, she milked your boobs, and there were a lot of people I knew there.
I'm gonna be joined by a horribly disfigured former fighter providing barely intelligible commentary throughout.
Uh, I-I think that they're... they're gonna have, they are gonna be fightin' Deirdre's last fight in the contrast to the later one is gonna be bet-better than usually.
And how do you think that helps her chances tonight?
Well, the match lastin' the bout up until the particular inaccuracy, particular unusually that should be the ultimate determining factor in about the the heart of a champion margarine hat.
We'll be checking in with you throughout the night, Floyd.
In this corner, weighing in at 134 pounds, the top-ranked boxer in all of Rhode Island,
And in this corner, weighing in at 130 pounds, it's the Ovarian Barbarian and the Breast of All Time, let's put our hands together for Quahog's own...
No hitting below the belt, no rabbit punches, no name calling, no making trouble for unconventional couples who want to adopt babies, 'cause you know what, they ain't gettin' the good babies, anyways.
All right, Lois, you listen to me and you listen good.
I watched you raise three kids on a shoestring budget-- you never gave up then, and you're not giving up now!
And if there was a hall of fame for hearts, yours would be the biggest one in the whole damn building!
All right, Lois, you listen to me and you listen good.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at round six-- the round that Deirdre Jackson predicted she'd kill Lois Griffin.
What do you think, Floyd, is she gonna make good on that promise?
A broken promise is a lot like a child's pinwheel.
You have to b-be yourself, or at least within the confines.
All right, well, let's see what's going on in the ring.
Now, if everyone could just pick up two chairs before you leave, we can get this place cleaned up a lot quicker.
How did Lois Griffin do what no other challenger could do and knock out Deirdre Jackson?
I-I have a strong headache when I go to sleep and wake up.
And how do you think that's going to affect Jackson's next fight?
Well, I gotta be honest, Lois, I had my doubts, but you really held your own in that ring.
Thanks, Brian. It was nice to go out a champion.
And thanks to Deirdre, I even got some of my own milk to put on my cereal.
And there's a note from my publisher. We are returning all of the unsold copies of Faster Than the Speed of Love.
I have tried and I have tried, and nothing has worked out.
I... put my heart out there, and it keeps getting stomped on.
What? Writing's the only thing that's giving your alcoholism any credibility.
Ooh, hey, you know, I just thought of something, hold on a sec.
I bought a vase last week and it's still in the box, and I just want to check to see what they used to pack it...
The number-one book on The New York Times Bestseller list is Dream Your Way to Spiritual Joy by Pauly Shore.
I-I tell ya, I could crap one of those things out in a night.
No, I mean it. I could do it in three hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.
Well, why don't you? Believe me, I would love to, just to make a point, but I... I've given up writing.
You don't care about this, so what does it matter?
I don't know, Stewie, I kind of like to write in solitude.
No, no, I promise, I'll be as quiet as a guy in a coma.
Why has no one done this? I need a pen, where's a pen?
Oh, right, I can't move. That's okay, I'll remember it.
I mean, I can't forget a million-dollar idea like that.
It's even better than the one yesterday about the guys who...
Damn it, I just had it. All right, calm down.
Oh, you got to be kidding me, I just had it.
No, no, you (bleep) idiot. No wonder your wife shot you.
Three hours, 27 minutes and I've got myself one big steamin' pile of book.
Thanks. Okay. Chapter One: Wish it. What are all the things you want most in the world? Use the following blank pages to write down all of your dreams and desires.
Ah. Brilliant. Make them do the work. Yeah, why not?
You know, i-i-if people want crap, I'll give 'em crap.
And, you know, I have a friend who might be able to help get this published.
Wait, you have a friend in publishing and you never told me before?
Yeah, I don't know if you want to start digging around in this area.
Let's just leave it at he's a friend in publishing and he calls on Thursdays.
Um, hey, Brian, when you're done, can I make a pirate hat?
Um... red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath-- um, I-I-I don't really have time to do this right now.
All right, everyone, I made a very special breakfast to celebrate Brian's book coming out.
And... and... it's a special breakfast for me, too, right?
Because... because it is the anniversary of when I started to eat vegetables.
Oh, Lois, you didn't have to go through all this fuss.
I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer.
Well, n-nice going, Stewie. You ought to be my publicist.
You know, I-I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related.
You know, I-I spent a month as Melanie Griffith's loose skin holder.
(à la Droopy Dog): I should have stayed in bed.
Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book-- no personal questions, all right?
Are you okay? You good? You... You need anything? All right.
All right, we're inside and there is nobody here to greet us.
We have no idea where we are or where we're supposed to go.
Oh wait, is that you on the phone over there?
And Mr. Griffin, I just have to say, I loved your book.
Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water!
Ooh, I said no gray M & M's. These are all gray.
Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work.
We're here with Brian Griffin, local author of the new bestseller Wish it, Want it, Do it.
N-Now, what does that mean-- Wish It, Want It, Do It?
Uh, well, it... it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible.
Uh... yeah. Okay, oh, so this... so now... so this is... this is a true story.
I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian.
I'm sorry, do you want me to call back and change it?
Well, it's done now. Seems like a lot of extra work.
Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00.
And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis.
Geez, how heavy? I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me.
Oh, look at this, your book is number three on Amazon.
Unless it was written by a ten-year-old's bottom, who cares?
I... it doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I... I would guess that it's probably not that.
Well, Stewie, I can't tell you how much I appreciate all you're doing.
I mean, I-I have been so happy with most everything.
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even, it's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth... Oh, my God, you're amazing.
That's like one of the things I was talking about.
I just have to tell you, I loved your book, Mr. Griffin.
(giggles) Okay, well, I'll be right back with your key.
How... How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room later?
Oh, my God, were you... were you thinking of doing that?
Hi, um, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.
Wish It, Want It, Do It totally changed my life.
Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I gotta tell you, that makes me feel pretty great.
Listen, I want to thank you all for coming down.
And remember, Wish It, Want It, Buy It. All right.
Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.
God, you know, Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,
You know, now that we have two minutes to kinda let the dust settle,
I just wanna say that I'm really proud of you.
I-I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's-it's really about having the courage to just kinda get inside your own head and just kinda poke around in there, you know, be, like, Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here? Hey, what do you call yourself? Oh, Wisdom. Oh, Profundity. Oh, Truth. Hey, let's, let's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book.
How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
I-I told them who you were when I made the reservation!
And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better.
And you being honest with me, well, that's helping me do that.
Oh, Brian, are you going straight back to the hotel?
Geez, Lois, could I have, like, five minutes to decompress, please?
It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a Japanese guy who had a cold.
STEWIE: Dear God, he's become a monster! (kitchen cabinets banging)
BRIAN: Stewie, I got a flea thing goin' on in here!
Okay, so the topic is going to be, Should God play a role in politics?
Stewie, the point of the bologna is that I don't know the pill is there.
You'll be on the panel with Arianna Huffington and Dana Gould.
My-my publicist told me Christopher Hitchens would be on the panel.
No, we told him Dana and Arianna two hours ago.
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
I have some insight on this. Bill, do you mind?
Well, it just so happens that separation of church and state is something
Um, for one thing, In God we trust is on money.
Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y about any sort of stupid (bleep).
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
Really? Because I read Wish It, Want It, Do It.
Uh, gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your lives.
Well, it may be popular, but I, I have to say I agree with Arianna.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe, maybe 'cause it sounds like you're talking with a mouthful of syrup,
Actually, it, it, I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot want it, which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
And that's another thing, I have to say aren't wish it and want it really the same thing?
(audience laughs) I mean, your book... basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point.
Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a lot of people, Bill...
Um, how does this help people, like, with cancer or in Darfur?
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
If I didn't know what it meant, I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...
I-I'm not gonna give you, I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction.
You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody.
I mean, yes, Dana has made a career in comedy.
I don't think he's ever done anything as laughable as this book.
What do you want? I wrote it in a day.
(audience groans) Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours.
I think you're totally getting the wrong impression of me.
I-I was just trying to write something that would sell.
Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now.
I mean, if you're gonna dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in...
Look, just tell me what you want me to say!
I just wanna talk to you about everything that happened.
Um, you know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down.
This all happened so fast, and I lost sight of who I was.
I mean, you know, sure, you were in a little over your head, but...
Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about all the things you did wrong.
All right, Stewie, I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
This, this is not about how many things you messed up along the way.
So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted to your many errors.
And I'm here to tell you the story of a very special Christmas in Quahog.
Kenny Rogers was supposed to be here, but I think he's dead.
Anyway, Seth came out of my penis, and now he made this.
The town was blanketed with snow, the trees were being trimmed, and everyone was making up their Christmas lists.
All these happy wishes and lots of Christmas cheer is
If you put a Christmas tree in the public airport,
Of all the malls in this great country of ours, he chooses to come here.
You know, I mean, who... Who are we? You know?
Yeah. I hope you've been a good boy this year.
Do you know how much talking it took to get her out of the house because of her no-hair?
That waiting in line is such a catastrophe for you that you'd rather destroy the confidence of a five-year-old cancer patient?
Oh, come on. I... I didn't know she was dying.
'Cause we're gonna see Santa, and he's gonna bring you a new brain.
Now we got to go to the back of the line.
Some fat kid sitting on Santa's lap taking all day.
Yeah, yeah. And I want a Charles in Charge lunch box and I want a Magna Doodle and a new Uno game on a 'cause of I lost the Draw 2 card.
And I want a pet animal that's half chinchilla and half mink,
'cause it'd be really soft, and I could call it chink, and that's okay.
Now, um, we've got a slight problem here, because I have been rather naughty.
Hey, wait... Wait, buddy, buddy, we've been in line for, like, two hours.
You want your kid to sit on my lap, meet me at the bar at Applebee's.
If that beslubbering, onion-eyed maggot-pie thinks he can just blow me off like that, he's got another thing coming.
Look, Stewie, I know you're disappointed that you didn't get to see Santa, but I... I'm not driving you to the North Pole.
Now, I think we should go down there to support him.
Yeah, apparently, something happened at the mall, and she took a turn for the worse.
It doesn't sound like he wants us there for some reason, but... But we should go anyway.
And so Brian and Stewie set off on the road to the North Pole.
Hey, you want to hear a real live-action fart instead of one of those fake cartoony ones?
Well, it has to be small because of all the tiny elves.
Y'alls ready to kick it in some fine North Pole gear?
(yelling): Do you think I'm an idiot?! Huh? Do you?
Look, Stewie, the North Pole is a long and dangerous...
You can't jerk me around when it comes to Santa Claus, Brian!
There is a Ferris wheel here, and a guy hosing vomit!
Yeah, 'cause he can have anyone he wants, and she knows that!
Now you get your ass back into that hippie car of yours and take me to the North Pole now!
Look, I know you're upset, but why... Why don't you just sit down, write out your Christmas list, and I promise I will mail it to Santa Claus?
Well, then why do you want to go all the way to the North Pole?
RON: So it turned out Stewie was determined to kill Santa Claus.
Wait a minute, why the hell do you want to kill Santa?
Because that fat bastard blew me off at the mall, and he shall not go unpunished.
I'm gonna see the workshop, pet a few reindeer, take a few pictures of me and Santa, and then I'm gonna blow his brains out, hopefully with his bitch wife watching.
This is ridiculous... We are not going to the North Pole.
Trust me, it's a waste of time... You're not gonna find Santa.
Because when you get there, you may find out it isn't what you thought it was, and I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.
Well, you know, you know why nothing works out for you, Brian?
That's not fair. I don't think I have a negative attitude. I just...
I... I don't think it's a good idea for us to embark on a potentially dangerous journey whe...
Oh, I got a flock of birds that were too tired to fly back north.
Boy, this is the way to do it, huh, Jerry?
Well, you know, if you had just taken me to the real North Pole to see Santa, none of this would have happened!
You do what you want, Brian, but I am going to the North Pole and I'm gonna kill that bastard!
Stewie, you're putting me in a hell of a position here, but I have no choice.
You're not gonna kill Santa Claus, because he doesn't exist.
Is... Is SpongeBob not there at the bottom of the ocean giving Squidward the business? Hmm?
Is Curious George not really out there making little boats out of newspapers that he should be delivering? Huh?
I'll tell you what, you take me to the North Pole, and if Santa isn't there, I'll do something for you.
When Lois does that middle-of-the-night feeding where she doesn't even open her eyes or really wake up,
Oh, no, that's AAA. I just came from AA, eh?
Oh, I see. Yeah, looks like you got some water leakage.
Jose, Roberto, whatever... If you've got some Latinos up here that can fix cars, that'd be great.
No, I mean, it looks like you need a part, eh?
Well, yeah, when it's fixed, we can celebrate, but let's deal with first things first.
Well, I can probably take you to a gas station, eh?
I don't know, my name carries a little weight, but I don't see how that matters here.
Look, we don't have enough cash to fix the car, and we're kind of on our way to the North Pole.
If you like, you can have all my money and my leg.
Well, at least we're done with the first leg of our journey, Brian.
Out of gas? But, Brian, it's freezing out here! What are we gonna do?
There's an old, abandoned hunting cabin about two miles north of here.
You could spend the night there and then resume your journey in the morning.
Guess there are a few stars in the sky tonight.
I think we should really try to call Lois and tell her where we are.
Hey, Lois, would you make an appointment for me to be neutered in two days?
And whatever I say in two days, do not let me convince you that I've changed my mind.
Oh, I am. In fact, I have this document that legally binds me to same.
I received a call about notarizing a document, but I am spending the day with my family, so they are here, too.
This is my wife, Janice, my daughters, Lisa and Jane, and this is Rosalyn, a friend of our daughter Jane's.
Her family life is rough, so we are kind of like a second home.
Well, thank you for taking the time to notarize this important document.
Yes. We only have a moment, for we are taking a bus tour of Providence and other places.
The next morning, Stewie and Brian set out on foot for the North Pole.
They were cold and tired, but Stewie was determined to carry out his plan to kill Santa Claus.
As long as I've got all you people watching, does anyone want to buy some pot?
Now, while you think about the fact that you're never going to enjoy a nocturnal breast-feeding from Lois,
Dear Family Guy bastards, who the hell do you think you are?
I'll have you know that Bridgeport is among the world leaders in abandoned buildings, shattered glass, boarded-up windows, wild dogs and gas stations without pumps.
I'm not leaving until Santa Claus is dead by my hand!
Well, there isn't a great deal of sport in that.
I thought you were supposed to be jolly and happy.
Oh, that reminds me... I need a new version of Quicken.
In fact, I think the toxins are taking even more of a toll than the inbreeding.
I started with one family of magic elves, and every year I needed more and more to keep up.
Now they're just a sickly race of mutated genetic disasters.
The workload destroys them, but they don't know anything else.
It's gotten so their instincts take over, and near the end, they just walk out into the snow and die.
Then the reindeer eat them, which has turned the reindeer into wild, feral creatures with a blood-lust for elf flesh.
I'll tell you what, shove your list up your butt
And while you think it's swell we are toiling in Hell.
Take a look, you can tell as a man I'm a shell
So Brian and Stewie found Santa Claus, but he sure wasn't what they expected.
It turned the increasing demands of Christmas had all but destroyed the poor old man.
Uh, ye... He doesn't know what he's saying, he's delirious.
Is anyone else a little freaked out by that Allah thing?
I... I don't think he even knows where he is.
Yeah, I mean, uh, I'll just... try and do it, I guess.
That one reindeer just kind of pooped in the other reindeer's face, and...
All right, according to this map, we're approaching the northeast coast of the U. S.
Look, I've never landed one of these things before, okay?
In and out of this house and onto the next one.
Oh, for the love of God, they're still in the sleigh.
Well, how the hell are we gonna get back inside?
You know, those... Those aren't socks and underwear donated by the fire department to some battered women's shelter.
Did you just eat that whole cookie off the mantel?
Yeah, but you're not supposed to eat all of it.
They... They need some kind of indication that Santa was here.
All right, I'll eat the damn cookies if I want!
I'm gonna make a sandwich, get some chips or something.
We... We came down the chimney, but we... We forgot the presents.
Let me just clean his father's blood and hair off it.
We've been here for an hour and a half! An hour and...
It's gonna be light in six hours, and we have to deliver to the whole rest of the world!
We were supposed to save Christmas, and we completely blew it.
He gives and gives and gives, and everyone just takes him for granted.
Hell, I... I didn't even think he existed until last night.
Hopeful citizens worldwide woke up to disappointment this morning when they discovered no gifts from Santa under their Christmas trees.
Local officials are going with the theory that everyone was bad this year.
The reason there was no Christmas this year is that this man is sick.
The workload of filling our Christmas lists has overwhelmed him.
And at the rate he's going, he may not make it another year.
If all of us everywhere can just cut back our demands and ask for only one Christmas present every year, there may still be hope.
I know it's in our nature to resist sacrifice, even in hard times, but if we don't, we may have to give up Christmas altogether.
Well, folks, you heard it here first on Channel Five News.
One Christmas gift a year for each one of us.
But if it's a gym membership, somebody's getting punched in the (bleep) face.
Would you rather have dinner and then sex with Megan Fox's body with Leonard Nimoy's head on it or re-roof an entire condo complex by yourself?
No, eye contact the whole time and a lot of kissing.
Well, how about Megan Fox's head on Leonard Nimoy's body?
Yeah, 'cause it makes a difference what you're carrying up that ladder.
You know, is it Megan Fox's neck or am I burying my face in Leonard Nimoy's turkey gizzard?
I didn't get any sleep 'cause Brian and the neighbor's dog kept me up all night.
Oh, wow. Well, if you're that tired, Peter, maybe you should have some coffee.
Barack Obama makes a visit to James Woods High School.
President Barack Obama will visit James Woods High next month, and this little town of ours couldn't be more abuzz.
Just 'cause Obama's coming, everybody in my English class has to write a stupid essay about hope.
Chris, this is just a shaded-in triangle and the word muff.
Just tell me if you think the tone is right.
Well, I don't know what this is, but it's not what hope is about, Chris.
Well, if you're such a genius, you tell me what hope is.
Hope is what gets you out of bed in the morning when it's the day of prom and you haven't been asked.
Hope pushes the caterpillar through the cocoon and drives the salmon upstream.
Your breasts may be small and your glasses may be thick, but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.
Hope is a horizon we head for, leaving nothing behind us but fear.
And though we may never reach our goals, it's hope that will save us from who we once were.
It's got to be inside you, like musical talent or athleticism or the ability to choose to be gay.
What's up, party people? Ah, what the hell are these things, curtains or something? Boring!
There, ah, that's terrific. It opens up the whole room.
Oh, so I had a few Red Bulls, drove to New York.
Chris, I'd take it as an insult if you didn't.
Here you go, have some cans, one, two, three, four, five.
Go on, take 'em, take 'em, take 'em, take 'em, take 'em.
All right, I'm gonna go outside and milk the cow.
I bought it so we can have fresh milk every day.
Top winner for the day is Peter, so you're gonna be the first to spin it.
Go ahead, Peter, close as you can to a dollar without going over.
All right, while we're waiting for the wheel to spin, you want to say hi to anybody?
You know that essay about hope I had to write?
Well, the principal said it was the best one in the class, and he wants me to read it aloud to introduce the President!
Remember when I used to come to school to wipe you, and I'd say, Someday I won't have to wipe you anymore and you'll do great things?
Wait a second. Give me that. Hope pushes the caterpillar through the cocoon and drives the salmon upstream.
But now you get to meet the President of the United States because of what I wrote.
Ugh! I bet you don't even know what his first name is.
It was making you crazy, and it's not good for you.
That's why I poured it all out in the garden.
Lois can't stop me from experiencing the manic highs and lows my body demands.
Now, why don't you leave me alone while I'm doing my important work?
Dr. Hartman, please tell me, is my husband gonna be all right?
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid all the toxic chemicals your husband ingested from his homemade energy drink have caused total kidney failure.
We'll put him on a kidney transplant list, but that could take months.
Until a donor is found, he's gonna have to undergo dialysis treatments three times a week.
Ah, have a seat, Peter. Let's get you hooked up.
Doc, I don't know how much more of this I can take.
Yeah, but I just go crazy just sitting here for so long.
Aw, I know it's tough, but maybe there's something I can do to make it easier.
President Barack Obama, it will be a very big day for one local teenager who will be reading his essay to introduce the President.
I sat down with accomplished wordsmith Chris Griffin. Hope is a horizon we head for, leaving nothing behind us but fear.
Chris Griffin, a weaver of dreams at the loom of the mind.
A weaver of dreams at the loom of the mind.
You're not the first person to be outshined by a sibling.
Aw, I want to watch this, but I got stupid dialysis at 3:00.
I am so sick of this crap mucking up my life.
Well, Peter, I mean, what, you can get away with skipping one treatment, right?
The Charles part is formal, but the In Charge part is kind of casual.
You know, it's kinda weird that '80s white clothes could pass for '90s black clothes.
You know, I heard the sweater budget on this show was 200 grand.
Suppose he's stuck somewhere, or he's trapped in an elevator or God knows what else?!
Well, as I said, Mrs. Griffin, he's on a list, but there are a lot of people ahead of him.
Well, what are the chances of getting him moved up the list?
Honestly, not great. It could be months before he can get a transplant.
Unless you know someone who's a compatible organ match and would be willing to donate one of theirs.
I'll do it. He could have one of my kidneys.
But it turns out you are a match for a little girl who's dying in that next room over there.
Oh, well, how 'bout we concentrate on this family, Doctor?
You'll just have to roll the dice and hope a kidney comes through soon.
The result wound up being a man-sized chicken that was incredibly hostile and ended up escaping from the lab.
Okay, Doc, we gotta have a talk at some point, but Brian, are... Are you... Are you sure about this?
Mrs. Griffin, could I speak with you and Brian alone, please?
You can cry about it, or you can decide to live.
Well, as a dog, Brian's kidneys are smaller and don't have the capacity of a human kidney.
For the procedure to work, we would need to transplant two.
You gave me a home when I didn't have one.
And you've treated me like a family member ever since.
I'd probably be dead anyway, lying under some freeway overpass.
I'm willing to give that up so you can have another forty.
And, hey, we... We had a lotta good years together, right?
Good. I'd rather he didn't know about this till it's over.
Now, since the operation is tomorrow, I thought it might be a good idea to just kinda close the book, you know?
So I just wanted to share my final thoughts with each one of you.
Meg, you're so beautiful on the inside, but it's very important that you know your limitations.
Well, I know they say Reach for the stars, but if we all did that, there'd be nobody left here on Earth, right?
Chris, I have watched you grow from a little boy into the young man you are today.
I know sometimes life seems tough, but you just remember to reach for the stars.
And, Lois, I only ask this because of the dire situation I'm in, but... can I, can I hump your leg for fifteen uninterrupted seconds?
You and I are going to spend the rest of our lives living right here under the slide.
I know what you're planning to do, and I won't allow it!
You're not going to kill yourself for that fat bastard!
Look, I've made up my mind, all right? Now untie me.
Come on, you... You can live without a dog, Stewie, but you can't live without a father.
And besides, how exactly do you think we're supposed to live here on the playground?
The jungle gym is the grocery store, the swing set is the mall, the seesaw is the post office, and the sandbox is our summer home.
I mean, yes, we'll... We'll have to rent it out some years to help pay for...
Oh, no, wait, no, we won't, because I'm a famous race car driver. I forgot!
And if you don't let me go right now, you're gonna lose your dad.
Hey, whaddaya say you be my dog one last time, huh?
Um... Cutting me open, harvesting my organs and killing me.
You gonna go get it? You gonna get it, boy?
And I'm willing to give up one of my kidneys.
Oh, my God, Dr. Hartman, you'd do that for us?!
Well, the truth is you folks are my only remaining patients.
Well, chances are Peter never would have survived the surgery.
I'm happy to welcome you all here to our auditorium for something that's not a terrible play.
In fact, tonight we're graced with the presence of our Commander in Chief.
But first, to introduce him is a very talented young man,
My sister Meg will be helping me introduce the President, since we wrote this essay together. What is Hope? by Chris and Meg Griffin.
Hope is what gets you out of bed in the morning when it's the day of prom and you haven't been asked.
Hope pushes the caterpillar through the cocoon and drives the salmon upstream.
Your breasts may be small and your glasses may be thick, but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.
Hope is a horizon we head for, leaving nothing behind us but fear.
And though we may never reach our goals, it's hope that will save us from who we once were.
Searching for a way to tap into the hidden strengths that all humans have.
Then an accidental overdose of gamma radiation alters his body chemistry.
And now whenever Stewie Griffin grows angry or outraged, a startling metamorphosis occurs.
The creature is driven by rage and pursued by an investigative reporter.
The creature is wanted for a murder he didn't commit.
And he must let the world think that he is dead, until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.
No, Brian. The new female anchor is about to do that Child of the Month segment.
And this is April's Child of the Month, eight-year-old Angus Reed.
And his only wish is to one day become a famous heart surgeon.
How old do they usually live to be, by the way?
Let me remind you all that this Saturday at 5:00 p.m., we'll have vespers, not to be confused with the Italian motor scooter.
And don't forget, next weekend, we will have the Sunday afternoon family picnic... as God said to Noah... weather permitting.
As the Corinthians said to the Galatians, That's my land.
And thank you for the great job you did with the rummage sale for the needy last weekend.
You know, I accidentally almost put a cashmere sweater in there.
What would one of them do with a cashmere sweater?
You know, Lois, we also have a bake sale coming up, and we're short about eight pies.
Well, I'll hit the grocery store this afternoon and get to work.
My God, does everything have to have a mascot these days?
I mean, look, there's a lion in overalls on the aluminum foil.
I don't mean to bother you, but my name is Lois Griffin.
I am a huge fan, and I just think you are doing a fantastic job.
And after what I went through with Diane Simmons, well, let me just say it's nice to be standing here with no one trying to murder me.
You know, it's my first anchoring job, and I'm trying to make a good impression.
We just watched that one with the little goofball who thought he was going to be a doctor.
You know, the news is so much better with you on it.
I'm on my way back to the station after lunch.
Great. Why don't you come down to the station around 6:00?
And Julie Andrews pleaded not guilty, saying that she brought the gun to the nightclub for protection.
And that's all for today's Channel Five News at 6:00.
I loved that piece you did on the invention of the guillotine.
Oh, thank you. You know, half the time those things didn't really work.
They let him smoke inside because all the smoke from his cigarette just floats directly back up into his face.
Hey, Joyce, when you get a chance, come take a look at the Weekapaug thing.
Well, look, if you want to grab a drink with me later tonight,
I also listen to jazz while I vacuum, which is cool.
My pets were going wild all weekend. I think there's, like, something in the air.
Sorry. I'm just painfully aware that I'm the only member of this family who's going out for drinks with a celebrity tonight.
They don't speak English, and they always mess up the order.
It's like trying to give my cell phone number to the housekeeper.
Okay, I'm expecting a very important delivery at the house.
Oh, my God, Joyce, you've got so many great stories.
Oh, come on, I'm sure you've done some crazy stuff in your time.
Shh! Please, please, please do not say a word to anybody.
I have never told anyone that, not even my husband.
Why did you drive the car into the air if you didn't know how to get it back down?
Look, Sandy, it seemed like a good idea at the time.
I promised my friend Joyce I'd watch the news tonight.
Pornography. The very word conjures up images of red-light districts, unprotected sex, and of course, the turn-of-the-century pornograph machine.
But it seems pornography has finally found its way to our neighborhood.
Yes, local housewife and church organist Lois Griffin has revealed to this reporter that she appeared in a pornographic movie back in the early 1980s.
Boy, that black bar would be a lot lower now, huh? Huh?
Evidently, Lois Griffin, star citizen of Quahog, is also Lois Griffin, star of Quest for Fur.
It just goes to show you never know what sort of person is living next door.
Yes, but they'd never let that name on TV, so I changed it to Kinney.
You told me I'd made the cheer squad, blindfolded me, and told me we were going for a special celebration breakfast.
I was standing in front of the entire school with my pants around my ankles and a hot dog in my mouth.
But we're adults now, and that doesn't give you any reason to humiliate me like this.
You don't like it, you can go talk to a reporter.
The kind of really good friends that communicate with each other poorly through Facebook.
Everyone, I think it's important that we talk openly about this.
It was back in a disgusting period known as the early '80s.
It was a time when women would stand topless, high on coke, on the edge of hotel balconies while the curtains were billowing around them.
My daddy's making me pay for my own tuition this semester because I maxed out all my credit cards buying a copy of E.T. at the video store.
And besides, I got another way you can make money.
So Raoul gave me a job at his pet store, but I still needed money.
One day I was cleaning a bird cage, and a porn producer came in, and... Well, the rest you know.
I kind of feel like, the part that we should have seen was...
I really need some church after the week I've had.
But, Father, I've been an active member of this church for...
Maybe you should've thought of that before you made a porn.
Well, I mean, you'd either say, You made porn, or You made a porno.
Oh, God, have I been saying it wrong this whole time?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't care.
And what does it matter what those people in church think?
I mean, most of of them are just random background people we've never seen before anyway.
Peter, that's very sweet, but how am I supposed to live in this town if I'm a social pariah?
Hey, Lois, can I talk to you for a second?
For the last time, Brian, there's no link to it anywhere online.
No, no, that's not... That's not what I'm here for.
Look, Lois, you did what you did, and there's nothing you can change about that.
But those people can only make you feel ashamed if you let them.
If you own the choice that you made, you take away all their power to make you feel bad about yourself.
Well, you remember a few years back, people used to make all those jokes about how Ryan Seacrest was gay?
And then he started making those jokes himself, and now nobody makes those jokes anymore.
I mean, he's still gay, but now it's no fun to joke about it, because he beat us to the punch.
And so did the Corinthians finally write back to Saint Paul, saying, Dude, enough with the letters. We have received them all, and will get back to you when we have the time. And by the way, a lot of the information you're asking for is available online.
I thought I made it clear that you are no longer welcome here.
You know, I've been coming to this church for years.
The rest of you need to accept the fact that I made a simple mistake.
I know I'm a man of God... but that (bleep) is hot!
<FONT color=#00ff00> Family Guy 9x11 </FONT> <FONT color=#00ffff>Friends of Peter G.</FONT> Original Air Date on February 13, 2011
I don't want to miss the movie trivia slides before the movie.
Peter, those questions are the easiest, most pandering things in the world.
I can never figure out when the hell the studio logos end and the actual movie begins.
Yeah, loosens me up so I can talk to the people around me.
Well, I don't know what that is, but The... The Cat From Outer Space is a solid motion picture.
'cause... 'Cause that's... That's the last guy you'd expect to be king of nothing.
That... That big guy up there on the screen's been talking through the whole movie.
Dear Liesl, I'd like to be able to tell you how I feel about you.
Leeza, get a... Get away from him. He's a Nazzi.
I... I know Jews is bad, but thems is worse.
I don't think... I don't think you heard me, buddy.
Mr. Griffin and Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty of creating a public disturbance and destruction of private property.
And all of this while under the influence of alcohol.
This court sentences you both to thirty days of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Mr. Sockerby, before we begin, have you ever been convicted of a felony?
I'm afraid I have to withdraw this witness, and I am going to those things you said I have to go to.
This sucks. Can't believe that judge is making us go to a month of AA.
You know, if you ask me, this is going to be a good thing for both of you.
I'm not saying she's a gold digger, but she's not messing with...
Okay, we got us a few new friends here joining us tonight.
So let's all say us a big hello to Peter and Brian.
Um, my name is Greg, and, uh, I'm an alcoholic.
One fateful night, I, uh, got behind the wheel of my brand-new sports car, blind-drunk.
I was responsible for the death of an innocent eight-year-old girl.
What, did you hit her over the head with it?
Before I found AA, my ex-boyfriend and I used to get drunk and party all night.
One morning, I woke up naked with three Persians high-fiving each other on the way out of my bedroom.
And my two new cats, Clean and Sober, just think I'm tops.
All right. Peter, do you have a story that you'd like to share?
This one time, me and Joe and Quagmire made a bet to see who could drink the most beer and still drive.
Peter, it sounds to me like alcohol is a very destructive influence in your life.
You need to relinquish your dependence and give yourself over to a higher power.
Brian, AA is the only way out for these people.
Hey, people got along just fine for thousands of years without AA.
Just like they got along for thousands of years without religion.
Hey, did you hear about that magic baby that was born in Bethlehem?
Just a bunch of losers telling boring stories. My drinking ruined my marriage. My drinking ruined my family.
I see you got your own thing going on this week, but there's a new teacher at preschool who deactivates the camera and then hits us.
It's helped a lot of people get over their addiction.
Their life goes from being all about drinking to being all about AA.
The only difference is, when it's all about drinking, they're more fun.
Well, like it or not, you got to stick it out for thirty days.
It's everybody else who's got a problem with our drinking.
She slams us into the monkey bars, but none of us have the language skills to call her on it.
You got to go to a weekend of school for that.
I sat here and listened to you bums the other day, and I got to tell you, I have never seen a duller bunch of pathetic bastards in my life.
I don't know who you were when you were drinking, but it sure as hell's got to be better than who you are when you're sober.
Yeah, you all stopped drinking because you were hurting your loved ones.
But you can't hurt them if they don't know you're drunk.
Attention, patrol cars, we've got a noise complaint at the Quahog Community Center.
So I did... So I just put my thumb over it, and then... And that got me through the rest of... of the... of the session.
We are gathered here again tonight, fellow AA members, to talk about the greatest temptation the Devil ever created:
One time, I took a liberry book out, and I fells asleep reading it, and I left it under the bed.
I forgot about it for three and a half years.
I was going to take it back on Amnesty Day, but on Amnesty Day, I had a sip of rosé wine, and I never made it out of the house.
If your head feels like it's two miles wide...   Two miles wide...
Now I don't leave my couch, and I've seen every movie ever.
This poor gentleman used to speak in long, eloquent sentences, but after years of drinking, he can only speak in short, choppy utterances.
Why, at one time, if you asked him who his favorite musicians were, he'd say Leonard Bernstein, Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
But thanks to that old devil hooch, it's all changed.
That's what he said, now...   Don't mess with Mr. Booze...
Don't you mess with Mr. Booze, don't mess with Mr.
Wow, you guys. I'm impressed that you're taking your sentence so seriously.
And I know that the court will be happy to hear this, too.
Now, if you'll just keep it down so I don't get any more complaints.
Should we take this party to Denny's and hang out with the cast of the high school play?
Nah. I think I'm... I'm just going to go home.
I'll crank the heat, roll up the windows and blast the Lullaby Channel. I'll be fine.
I'm going to... I'm going to... Going to meet Jenny's cats.
Hey, where's... You know, where's all the poop go when the cat...
All right... All right, look, let's get some music going on in here.
Oh, God. Did I hold on to the touchdown pass?
Look, I've been told I can give you another chance, but there's some things we have to do first.
I'm talking about you understanding alcohol just a little bit better.
Peter, I'm going to show you where your life is headed if you keep drinking as much as you do.
Stewie, go on, get out of here, you stupid laugh and cry, effin' cry.
Well that... That was a good idea you had dunking your hand in the toilet.
I wish I'd never touched a drop of alcohol in my life.
Everybody line up for a triple H: a hug, a handshake or a high five. Your call.
And all in time for my big bike ride announcement.
You know, I have started taking a Bufferin baby aspirin every day.
I mean, it's cool I know French, but, Death, this ain't me.
If I'm a drunk, I'm a jerk, and if I'm sober, I'm a douche.
You don't have to give up the booze cold turkey.
You members of the human race have the ability to send a man to the moon and make Justin Long a movie star.
With that kind of willpower, don't you think you can learn to put the bottle down just sometimes?
Thirty days of sobriety, and we can finally drink again.
Oh, for God's sake, Peter, didn't you learn anything from this?
From now on, half of every six-pack I buy is going in the trash.
Hey, how... How come we're the only animals with poo that's white?
Just look for the containers that say KFC on them.
His little habit of, uh, personal amusement is getting way out of hand.
Uh, life, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... finds a way.
You know, maybe you guys should help find Chris a hobby.
Let me just sniff his hat, that's all I want.
Okay, Chris, this is the gentle art of philately, otherwise known as stamp collecting.
Here's a pile of stamps, carefully culled from swap meets and garage sales.
Now, it says it's worth eight cents, but really... it's worth twelve.
Came right out of the blocks with a winner here, Chris.
Now, we'll just paste this very carefully into the book.
And what we're gonna do now is kill ourselves because this is horrible.
All right, Chris, this is one of the oldest hobbies in existence: Drinking.
Oh, hey, he can't be in here. He's not 21.
All right, just hang out here for a little bit, huh?
I could have gone pro if it wasn't for my bum knee.
I am Franz Gutentag, and this is my puppet shop.
You can create an entire world right before your eyes and watch it come to life.
It is waiting to become anything we wish it to be.
My name is Chris, and I like candy and jumping and colorful birds.
I'm a vampire, and I'm in love with this unattractive girl.
Grr, I'm a werewolf, and I am also in love with this unattractive girl.
You have really tapped into the wonder and enchantment that is puppetry.
Plus I move these dolls and make like they're talking.
Thanks for showing me how to do it and being so nice to me, Mr. Gutentag.
You know, Chris, seeing a young person like you enjoy puppetry makes me so happy.
Wow, I think you're just about my most favorite guy who's gonna die soon.
That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
Mr. Griffin, I'm sorry to bother you, but there's a...
Look, if this is about those droppings in your yard, it was, uh, uh, Brian.
At first I wasn't sure it was him, but I got a closer look, and now there's no question in my mind.
Lieutenant Franz Schlechtnacht, the most sadistic S.S. guard in all of Hitler's concentration camps.
How do you know this man was a Nazi prison guard?
I was a young Air Force pilot assigned as part of an escort for a bombing raid over southern Germany, when we encountered the Luftwaffe.
At first we thought we were in the clear because the Germans were frightened by the scary shark face on the front of our plane.
How did it get all the way up here in the sky?!
But there was one stubborn pilot who saw through our disguise.
Most of the surviving American pilots were taken to POW camps, but for some reason, they thought I was gay, so I was taken to a concentration camp.
Behind those walls, there was one guard who decided everyone's fate.
If he pointed to the left, you did hard labor.
I was spared death, but I was given hard labor.
But some of those bottles still had a little bit of soda in 'em.
It would spill out on my hands and make 'em kind of sticky.
Dear God, how my hands would get kind of sticky!
No one should have to suffer the way I suffered!
So that's why Chris should stay away from that puppet store guy.
Am I... Am I being skunked or puked or whatever some (bleep)?
I don't know, Franz seems like such a nice old man.
Y... You know, maybe we should just invite him for dinner and clear this whole thing up.
Yeah, you know, we got no right passing judgment without getting to know him.
Yeah, he doesn't talk, but, uh, he's a chipmunk, and he's Scottish, and he would back me up on this.
Chris, his name isn't Gutentag, it's Schlechtnacht, and he's a Nazi.
Clean your pool with my shirt off, or wash your car in jean shorts, bend over in front of you to get little bits of lint out of the rug?
He said you liked Hitler, and your name isn't really Gutentag.
For example, everybody thinks that prostitution is illegal, but there are ways around it.
No, I paid her to have sex and we're filming it.
Oh, well, as long as you're filming and selling it, it's legal.
Remember kids, she's not a whore if she's an actress.
Say, listen, my wife and I appreciate how nice you've been to my son with all the puppets and whatnot, and, uh, we wanted to invite you over for dinner.
And I shall celebrate our friendship by giving you a hand-carved German wall clock.
But you got three of them on the wall over there.
I must be sure no one ever finds out the truth.
Well, you might want to do something about that first.
I... I... How do I know which one to shoot?
How do I know which one is the real Dad?!
Mr. Gutentag, I'm sorry to bother you, but Chris and Peter didn't come home last night.
All right, let's try and figure a way outta here.
Look around. See if you can find something to break the door down with.
All right, let's figure a way to get outta here.
Now we can't fit through the window, but maybe there's some way we can let people know we're down here.
We gotta make as much noise as possible to get people's attention.
Oh, and if you see Meg, tell her Thunder Thighs are on the move!
You know, I gotta say, Chris, all my life I wanted to see you locked in a basement, but now that it's happened, all I want to do is get you out.
You want me to write that Thunder Thighs thing down for you?
And I'll tell you this: only one of us is gonna walk outta here alive.
If only I had listened to you, none of this would've happened.
Sometimes the only way to really appreciate what you have is to see what life is like without it.
Hi, Lois, um, I hate to bother you, but I'm going out of town for a few days to visit my father in the hospital.
I was hoping that while I was gone, you could look in on Susie and Joe.
Bonnie wants you to look after Susie and Joe while she's out of town.
And... And I said Rachel Maddow, and she kind of took the baton from there and said Meg Griffin.
Let me just get this little guy assembled. â™ª Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doodie, doo. â™ª
Oh, I'm just always interested in where people are from.
I mean, when was the last time you tried to blow something up, or take over the world, or even used the phrase, Damn you?
I'm learning to use the toilet, I'm learning what shapes are.
I... I spent half an hour laughing at my own feet yesterday.
Well, I don't care for your tone and I'd say you deserve a good kick in...
Oh, well, I'm here to help you out while Bonnie's gone.
Uh, do you have any experience helping out people with special needs?
Well, I did work for that old lady down the street.
Could you see if I'm getting a bed sore on my back?
Well, Brian, I thought about what you said at the park, and I've decided you're right.
So I've built a concentrated neural enhancement device, designed to boost my evil side.
All right, shall we take this thing for a spin?
Helicopters are going to hurt us, and I make them stay away.
Come on, help me get some of Peter's tools out of the gay-rage. ...97, 98, 99, 100.
I really appreciate you helping me out these past couple of days.
I guess now I know not to get too close to your bowl, right?
I know you're not trying to hurt me, but part of me doesn't know.
That Puerto Rican street gang give you any trouble on your way home from school?
I hear you teenage girls are pretty hot on that, uh...
Is that a band, or a soda, or a store, or...
Unless your version of a picnic is being the basket.
Well, you seem like you have a good attitude about it.
Yeah, you know, it's like we handicapped people say: When life ruins your legs, you just gotta make legonade.
You know, sometimes it's really hard being me, and I guess I just make Megonade.
Most times people just drop me off a block away so they don't have to be seen with me.
Well, I... I better go, I don't want to be tardy.
Ah, that's not going to happen from missing one class.
Oh yeah, I just wanted to make sure you got a nice hot breakfast before you head off to work.
If he doesn't say anything about me calling him Joe, that means we're truly in love.
But I'll just let it slide. She's got nothing going on.
Look, I don't know what's going on here, but don't be throwing things, because that's just not safe.
That's why I didn't feel more evil... all the evil energy went into him.
If I can decode the genetic puzzle of this being, perhaps I can determine how to apply it to my own neurological makeup.
Oh, yeah. Susie spit up on me, and I didn't want to go all the way home, so I just threw this on.
It's just that I like to put the straw in myself.
I was just calling to tell him my father is recovering well and the doctors say he'll be fine.
Wheely-wheely stupid head, but you wish that you were dead.
Listen, I don't know who this is, but you better cut it out! I'm a cop, you know!
Oh, what, are you gonna report me on your can't walkie-talkie?
I got three more of these I wrote on a napkin.
A night out, a good dinner. Thank you so much.
Show you how much I appreciate all the hard work you've been doing.
So, listen, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
This feels right, but it tastes like a dirty penny.
I wouldn't have created Evil Stewie, he wouldn't have escaped and we wouldn't be trying to track down a murderer.
For all we know he could be killing someone else right now.
And I don't really know how to break it to you, so I'm just going to come right out and say it.
I remember when Brian had a similar difficulty with Meg.
Excuse me, Lois, I have to go make a phone call.
But, Meg, I think we have to have a talk.
Oh, my God, you do have a crush on him.
You're taking care of him and you're feeling a closeness that you're misinterpreting as a romantic connection.
But think about it, Meg. You two have nothing in common.
My God, we have to get you to the hospital.
Look, Meg, I do care for you, but I care for you like I... I would a niece or a good friend's daughter.
Don't. I'm lucky to have you as a neighbor, and even luckier to have you as a friend.
Thanks. I'm lucky to have you as a friend, too.
Look, I was a teenage girl with a crush at one time myself.
I... I hope I didn't get you into too much trouble.
I mean, you're not gonna go to jail or anything, are you?
I need these voice-over checks to support my gambling addiction.
I've had enough. I can't live with that stupid family anymore.
Do me a favor and end it all for me, will ya?
And I'm really glad I didn't kill the wrong Stewie.
We interrupt this program because I have had kind of a crap day, and I know all the station passwords to do it.
We haven't had one of those since they canceled Passions.
Okay, our top story tonight: A local car dealer has announced a Hands on a Hard Body promotion in which a used dirt bike will be reward... awarded to the one customer who can successfully outlast his competitors.
Peter, why would you want a used dirt bike when you already have a car?
Because this is 1978, Lois, and dirt bikes have never been hotter.
Besides, I get one of those things, it's gonna be a buffet of beav.
In just a minute, we'll begin our Hands on a Hard Body contest.
And the lucky one of you who can keep his or her hand on this dirt bike for the longest amount of time will get to take it home!
Okay, everyone who wants to win this dirt bike, come on up and put a hand on it!
Oh, not at all. But Lois told me how much you wanted it.
So I decided to win it for myself just so I could destroy it in front of you.
So I'm just gonna stick around and smash other stuff you like.
All right, that's good enough for me. I'm smashing it!
I just sent you a picture of a kitten in sunglasses.
Well, I guess I'll just disappear into that field of corn.
I don't know. I haven't heard from him since he left work.
I'm a dirt bike guy now, so I need a dirt bike girlfriend.
Yes, she has small breasts, but she makes up for it by smoking.
No, Lois! I will not allow you to look down on Amber just 'cause she goes to an alternative high school!
There's different ways to measure intelligence besides someone's grade-point average!
Fact is, she rumpled up some poetry she wrote and threw it away in a fit, but I un-rumpled it, and it was really good!
Fine. Amber, would you like to have some dinner with our family?
I got a wicked bruise on the back of my throat.
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem, performed this afternoon by Peter Griffin and his dirt bike.
What do you say we take it for a spin?
You mean look what two black teenagers did when they stole Dad's bike.
So you like taking dirt bikes that don't belong to you, huh?
By the end of that pack, you'll be smoking like a real pro. Like a cool kid.
It's like puttin' your penis to sleep in a feather bed.
Kids, I'm sorry to say this, but I think the two of you need to be punished.
You know, I don't think you kids appreciate how hard your father and I work to provide you with everything we do.
Now, when you start bringin' in a paycheck and providin' for this family, then you can make the rules!
Well, I'd do a better job of it than you!
Well, maybe you'd like to try it for a little while.
For the next week, you'll be the parents and we'll be the kids.
Wh... Wh... What is... What is this? What's goin' on?
Oh, apparently, Chris and Meg are switching places with Peter and Lois for the week.
Hey, Mom, do you mind if I go shoppin' with Jennifer after school?
All right, time to make all those popular kids pay for ignoring me!
Peter, no, y... You're just a normal high school kid.
Hey, Lance, it's off, it's off, it's off, it's off.
Wow. You know, I gotta say, when your dad told me about this whole switching places thing,
I was kinda skeptical, but you're actually doing good work.
Well, you're gonna be sore-y when we put you in the hospital for free, eh?
Oh man, can you imagine the disaster she's gonna walk out here with?
She has no idea how hard it is to cook.
Yeah, yeah, I bet... I bet she comes out with just like...
Poop on a plate would be good, because at least there'd be traces of my food still in there.
Seared ahi tostadas, grilled asparagus, couscous, and for dessert, molten chocolate lava cake.
Meg, when did you find the time to do all this?
I did it in like an hour. I don't understand why you're such a freakin' martyr all the time.
It's a house. It's a finite area. I'm not cleaning a town.
Hey, buddy, how was your first day in the real world?
And Angela even told me I might get a raise for doing such a good job.
Seems like the kids are doing pretty well at this grown-up thing, huh?
Guess I shouldn't have had so many action figure guns for lunch.
Three girls I don't care about made me cry in the bathroom.
I bet you Lois Griffin doesn't make the track team, which is an important thing in high school right now.
Yeah, everyone who's anyone is running track at our high school right now.
Yeah, and I bet she also doesn't live on the south side of town, which is suddenly important.
Good, now that you're both here, your father and I have something to say.
Being a kid is a lot harder than bein' an adult.
So let's just put things back the way they were and just forget all about this, all right?
You kids go back to school, Lois goes back to groceries,
She said I've been doing twice as good a job as you did.
So from now on, I'm the breadwinner in this house.
Hey, I forget. Were you in for this or not?
I seem to remember somebody saying the breadwinner makes the rules.
I like being a grown-up, and I wanna stay this way.
Well, Lois, practically speaking, somebody's gotta pay the bills around here.
Seems like you don't have a choice but to let Chris work at the brewery until Peter finds a new job.
I guess it could take Peter a long time to find a job in this economy.
I could see about getting back my old job as a police sketch artist.
Now, did you get a look at the man who assaulted you?
I... I don't know, it... It all happened so fast.
Hey, you know what else I draw really well? Bullwinkle.
I'd probably still be working if more crooks looked like Bullwinkle.
Well, did you finish all the accounts payable and the accounts receivable?
You can handle it, it's just a little extra paperwork.
Can this day get any more stressful? Wanted: Muscular man for discreet pushing and pulling.
If I could come home and have five minutes before you jump all over my back.
And what about you? Did you get a job today?
I want you two to do it right in front of me.
And I'm gonna throw forty bucks on your sweaty bodies when you're done.
I just heard all of that, and I just wanna say this family is (bleep) disintegrating.
Oh, hey, Chris, by the way, the roofer came today while you were at work.
I'll bet if I go upstairs to that bathroom that toothbrush is as dry as a bone.
Well, my science class is taking a field trip to the water purification center.
And it costs ten dollars for lunch and the bus.
What... What the hell is it with that school that every time you walk in there somebody wants ten dollars?!
Look, I... I'm really sorry, but if we're that desperate for money, isn't there something we can do?
I mean, maybe we could ask to borrow some from Mr. Quagmire.
Like to see me walk next door, hat in hand, and ask him for money.
Bet you'd have your nose pressed against the glass to watch that conversation.
No, you know what? Instead, let's just go knock on all the doors of all our neighbors and tell 'em I'm a failure!
Let's just go right now and tell everyone how much of a failure I am.
Oh, my God! I think Chris is having a heart attack!
Yeah, you almost worked yourself right into the ground, buddy.
Oh, it's all our fault. We never should have let you take on the pressure of being an adult.
Boy, I thought being a grown-up would be easier than being a kid.
I guess what we all learned is that no matter who you are, or where you come from, life is a terrible thing.
Yeah, but if you got your family to help you get through it, it's not quite as bad.
And, hey, at least I get my old job back.
Peter, I need you to pick up the dry cleaning.
All right. Well, I need my other white shirt back anyway.
Well, I had a third one, but it got ruined at that wine tasting at Michael J. Fox's house.
Now, we were going to show you the actual scene, but it... It would just make us all sad.
So, I... I'm just going to tell you what happened.
See, he has this disease, and it makes him shake a lot, and what with all the shaking, he spilled his wine all over my shirt, and my shirt, uh, was ruined.
Which, I mean, that's not how he said it, uh, but...
Anyway, I sent him the bill, and he sent me this check.
I don't... You'd think Tracy Pollan would... Would be in charge of the checkbook, you know?
'Cause I mean, what else is she doing right now?
I don't, I don't think he's got the leverage to Rita Wilson her around town anymore. I mean, I... I... That's...
I'm glad we took the high road on this one.
Oh, wait, now they're telling me they do want to show it.
You stop make bing bong! Every bing bong two cent!
Aw, this seems like it'd be a great place to work.
Oh, you want to play game, fatso? You big, big...
I no like you American! And all you American look alike!
Peter, I have been going to Mr. Washee-Washee for ten years, and I am not finding another dry cleaner.
Now we are going to invite him over for dinner, and you are going to apologize.
Um, my wife wants to invite you over for dinner.
Peter, isn't there something you'd like to say to Mr. Washee-Washee?
Mr. Washee-Washee, I'm sorry I was rude at your store.
Yeah, I can't... I can't understand a word he's saying.
If you're going to invite the owl you got to invite Harry Hamlin.
He's got my shirt in there, I can feel it.
Listen, Washee-Washee, that's my shirt, and I ain't leaving here without it.
You break in my house, I can kill you legally.
Fine, shoot me! But you're going to ruin the shirt.
Not the best way to spend a Thursday night, huh?
I was hoping to be at this Democratic Party fundraiser.
I... I call him Barry, you probably know him as Barack.
No, actually. I got arrested for protesting the Wal-Mart opening.
Oh, yeah. I went to the first part of that, but then some fireworks went off and I ran for two miles straight.
Hey, would you mind if I asked for your number?
I know, I know. But this time it's for real.
You know, I... I really feel like Denise is the girl
Besides, I thought Jillian was the girl you waited your whole life for.
I'll call her right now and ask her out to dinner.
Um, hey, listen, you know, I've had such a great time hanging out with you, and I was thinking...
Can someone put... Lois! Can someone put the dog out?
Well, you know, listen. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for yourself, why don't you take Quagmire's class on picking up chicks?
'Cause Quagmire forbids us to tell you about his life.
You know, if you ever want to get anywhere with this girl, you gotta ditch that negative attitude.
Do as I command, and we will defeat the Autobots once and for all!
You think Optimus Prime's gonna be dead, but then he's not dead.
I'm taking this from a robot that turns into a canoe?
When there's a battle on a gently-moving river, you'll want me.
Now as I said before, I can't make you into studs.
I can only help you bring out your inner stud.
Now how many of you guys think a woman is looking for Prince Charming?
Mort, how many times you been laid since your wife died?
No! You want to know how many times I've been laid since last night? 60!
Why? 'Cause I'm not trying to be a girl's Prince Charming.
I'm trying to be that big mistake they made at the bar last night.
Look, what's the first thing you say to a woman when you meet her?
No! You say, Hi, there. How's your relationship with your father?
But you lick yourself once in this class and you're out!
I was just looking you over and I had a question.
Hey, will you sign this form that says I hit on you?
Quagmire told us to dress flashy so girls would notice us.
Hey, who was that fat chick sneaking out of here this morning?
You know, I have to admit, Brian, I'm glad you called.
Shut up for a couple minutes, I'm gonna look around.
Yeah. How'd you like to get hit in the face with that?
You know, I came here 'cause I thought I'd made a mistake by not giving you a chance, but it's obvious you're just another typical jerk.
All right, let's see what you guys have done to make yourselves look like douchebags.
You're teaching us all this crap about how to get women and it's all a bunch of bull!
I came here 'cause I wanted to get Denise back and instead, you ruined my life!
These skills aren't for women you care about, you idiot.
If you never find love, then it's just meaningless sex.
You see, women are a lot like Saturday Night Live sketches.
Lots of them are awful, some are decent, and a few are pretty good.
But then there's that one... That one woman who's as amazingly perfect as Massive Head Wound Harry.
That's why I keep trying to figure out how to bring you back into my life.
Look at the man on the unicycle with a parrot on his shoulder.
If this is the kind of joy the '80s has in store for me, I'm ready.
Uh, Cheryl, don't you think it's time for us to go now?
You've been talking to John Davidson for half an hour.
But if you ask me, she got lucky, because now she's dodged the bullet of being in a relationship with a loser like you.
And what did I say would happen when I told you?
Well, you know, it's been so many years, and I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd just drop by and say hi.
My new boyfriend I guess knows you, and told me where you live.
Hey, Cheryl, get your fat ass over here before I dump you.
I always knew you were low, but you're nothing more than a back-stabbing, junkyard cur.
Listen, Brian, I... I've been a real heel, and I'd like to make it up to you.
Oh, well, that's very kind of you, but there... There's no need.
No, no, no, no, I... I want to. I want to.
In fact, you know, since you guys are already here,
I'd like to treat the four of us to dinner.
Guy looks like a million bucks, all green and wrinkly, right?
Um, he showed up at my door and said he was a Federal Boob Inspector.
And I was gonna tell him to go away, but he had a warrant.
But then he started saying things to me that my father might say if he were still alive, and I knew I liked him.
Well, I guess you guys have gotten pretty close, huh?
Did Quagmire ever tell you he was obese as a child?
Did Brian ever tell you he once had a tick on the back of his neck that he couldn't reach with his mouth, and it swelled up to the size of a ping-pong ball?
Well, it was still smaller than that thing you had on your lip for three years.
Oh, three years? You mean like the three years you have left on this planet?
Hey, if you guys are so close, maybe Jillian should know that you teach a class in picking up women.
Now I'm glad you made me face away during sex.
Maybe you boys will get it together someday, but it looks like that's all you are: Boys.
Cheryl's great, and I hope someday you get the chance to be with her.
Hey, you know, may... Maybe it took us stealing each other's girls to finally become friends.
We now return to a later-season episode of Family Ties.
You are to gather grapes for wine and prepare victuals for my return.
Well, you know, Carol sweetie, we are always here for you.
I always wanted a brother or sister, but instead I got a bro-ster.
I'm just saying that if you read somewhere that Gwen Stefani was a grandmother, you might not even bat an eye.
Your Aunt Carol's going to be staying with us for a little while, so she's going to need your room.
Hey, Stewie. You going to sleep in here with us?
Lying half-naked on a bed in black socks at 11:30 in the morning?
Was the immediate loving physical touch of a new man.
But now I know what I really need is a friend
I mean, how come men always feel like they can just use a woman?
Meg, this is a bar of soap with a scorpion in it.
Stewie, this is a lollipop with a desert spider in it.
And Chris, this is a comb made out of an armadillo shell.
Now, just don't use it to comb your hair and make promises to women you won't keep.
She has such low self-esteem that every time a man shows her the slightest glimmer of attention, she rushes into something serious and gets her heart broken like a teenage girl.
You can't imagine how it feels to have your heart broken so many times.
Aunt Carol, Mom says you'd make a great Florida whore.
You know, I always thought I'd be a good Florida whore.
Thanks to you, my hair stays like this when we stop.
I'm being a rascal and ringing people's doorbells and running away.
It's my first house. I'm not very good at this.
Lois, aren't you going to introduce me to your handsome friend?
Only the ones I'm about to ask to Friendly's for a Fribble.
Uh, Carol, given your present situation, it's possible that dating might not be such a good idea right now.
Ah! I must bless this coupling with my soggy English penis.
Come hither, that I may sire thee a dreary Brit!
Me, too, Carol. That was a great idea you had, about walking parallel to the water.
Carol, I want to make this a night you'll never forget.
Oh, by the way, I should tell you I've got aides.
And I want to have a million more, every night of the week for the rest of my life.
I can't wait to tell the gals at my singles group.
Carol, I'm really not sure you should be rushing into another marriage right now.
Well, Lois, I appreciate your input, but I'm capable of making my own decisions.
Look, I know I have a bit of a checkered past, but I believe in love at first sight.
Hey, Lois, I didn't flush. I want you to come see it.
Well, what we're discussing is whether or not marriage is a smart move for Carol at this point in time.
I was hoping you might be able to weigh in.
I was too touching the bush... Oh, cool, this rock has mica.
'Cause if you say Beetlejuice three times, then Beetle... Oh, that was a close call.
Like deciding whether or not you're going to have time to masturbate.
Adam is the most kind and attentive man I've ever known.
'Cause I remember you saying the same exact thing about Evan.
Yeah. Yeah, I do remember her saying that about me.
Lois, you didn't tell me you were bringing Evan here.
We bonded over the Red Sox one time, and now he's got to bring it up every time I see him.
And then there was your second husband, Randall, who you called your soul mate.
Now, you got to feed 'em every two hours, and I fed 'em an hour ago.
And then there was your third husband, Doggie Daddy, but you couldn't make it work
Do you have any idea how difficult it is for me to see my ex-husbands?
This is the kind of pain I'm trying to spare you from experiencing all over again.
Why can't you just let me be happy with the man I love?
Carol, if you marry him, you're just going to get hurt again.
Are you psychologically able to deal with this pain a tenth time?
Come on, where the hell am I supposed to go?!
'cause I know one day you'll do the same for me.
I don't care what it costs. Just make this man well again.
We now return to Germany's most popular late-night talk show,
Did you ever notice how the government buildings there are quite well-maintained?
Look, I know you're depressed about Mayor West, but I promise you made the right decision.
Just give yourself some time, and I'm sure you'll feel much better about it.
She says that to Meg a lot, so that's not good.
I guess I just better go call all my friends and tell them the wedding is off.
But listen, could you also say good-bye to Carol for me?
As of today, I'm stepping down as mayor and leaving Quahog forever.
I've decided to move to Alaska and become an Eskimo.
Adam and I were going to be brothers forever, and now he's gone!
All you got there is toys and cans of tuna fish.
Well, I got to eat. And I got to have fun.
Okay, now you're just saying the opposite of what I say.
No, I'm not. I'm saying the same as what you say.
Look, I'm not sacrificing my sister's happiness so you can have a playmate.
Oh, yeah? Well, nobody believed we'd make it, and look at us now.
That seems to me like a successful New England marriage.
My parents may have been against our relationship, but a lot of people supported us.
I don't know that I would've had the confidence to marry you.
And now that she needs my support, here I am abandoning her.
Well, that's what I tried to tell you, but you were as stubborn as a pigeon at an ad agency.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, these are all good ideas, but I think what people really get excited about is dropped museum popcorn.
But this is an ad campaign for a Nissan SUV.
Has the... Has the 4:10 flight to Alaska left yet?
But if it helps, you're not the first person to get a bum deal.
Mr. Edison, we're going to use your invention to power the world.
And Mr. Tesla, we're going to use yours in the background of Frankenstein movies.
I know you tried your best to make things right.
Well, since I ain't got no brother to play army guys with,
Hey, Quagmire, it's me. Meet me at the Clam in twenty.
I never even heard of this place an hour ago, and now everybody's flying there.
Oh, hey, listen, Quagmire, turn the plane around and bring it back here.
I made nine mistakes, and I was afraid that I was going to make another one.
Adam, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Hey, you know, when it's your turn to say, I do, you should say, I do the Dew, and then... and then we both pull out a Mountain Dew, and then I'll... I'll... And then I do, like, a radical skateboard jump off the altar.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
I know I've said that before... a lot of times... and it's always blown up in my face.
I love you... and I'll be proud to be your wife.
Oh, Peter, I'm so happy for the both of them.
I'm just gonna go into the kitchen and... look at somethin'.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
What do you want to order? Oh, wait, let me guess.
You-you would take the magazine and you'd put it on the floor and pee on it 'cause you're a dog and you're stupid, and-and you have a weird toenail halfway up your elbow.
I could go back in time and have that comeback ready.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
What do you want to order? Oh, wait, let me guess:
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
We came in peace for all the peoples of the Earth.
We chose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.
We have slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the face of God.
Yeah, if you could just grab some rocks, Neil, throw 'em in a bag, we'll get you home safe and sound.
I can go back in time and change anything in Brian's life.
Hey, you remember a few months ago when you scored that date with that Victoria's Secret model and then ended up sealing the deal?
Stewie, I know you've been going back in time to embarrass me.
Uh-huh. Let me see that panel. No, no, don't touch that!
I'm not gonna let you do this... You just touched my boob.
What? Well, the return pad works by first locking onto our coordinates along the curve of the space-time continuum.
Well, the only explanation is... we've somehow been transported outside the space-time continuum.
But still somehow a large, brightly-colored promo for The Cleveland Show.
Come on, Stewie, can you fix that damn thing or not?
It operates according to the laws of physics, but we're outside the space-time continuum, so there are no laws of physics-- watch.
I fell in love with you   Bum-bah, duh-duh, bum-bah, duh-duh
And stole a kiss in the night   Bum-bah, duh-duh, bum-bah...
Because if-if-if there were people here, they would say, That was good.
Well, if I overload the return pad's reactor, it might release enough energy to blow us back into the universe, but it's too risky.
And if I overload that reactor, we could both die.
And if you don't, I am gonna spend the rest of eternity chuckling at a joke that I am not gonna share with you.
Okay, now tell me the joke. Oh, it's nothing really.
It's just this bit about a planned parenthood clinic on Halloween.
Brian, I am about to show you something that's gonna blow your mind!
Yeah, the theory that the universe started with a massive outward explosion from a singularity of infinite mass and infinite density.
The universe's cosmic background radiation, a kind of echo of the big bang, precisely matches the energy spectrum of my return pad!
It means my return pad's explosion was the big bang.
But the big bang happened, like, billions of years ago.
You were born in the universe. How could you create it?
The universe created me, so I could create it, so it could create me and so on.
You're, you're sort of the Art Garfunkel of the universe.
Hey, Lois, check out what I spelled with my Alpha-Bits.
I've gotta pick up some plutonium for a new return pad.
Oh, just a little of the good stuff for a new time machine return pad.
Well, the good news is my son died in a car bombing.
Eh, I'm just a little upset because she left me.
You don't realize it yet, but your life is about to cease to exist.
I am going to kill one of your ancestors, effectively erasing you from history!
At least you can spend your final moments doing something you enjoy.
You know, it's funny, I had actually stopped playing with that toy, but now that I see you with it,
He's gone into the past, and he claims he's going to...
Those were ripples in time, Brian, emanating from some point in the past.
Bertram told me he planned to kill one of my ancestors.
He must have succeeded, thereby changing the past and erasing... me.
I wouldn't be there to be accidentally thrown outside the universe and subsequently create it.
Yes. Unfortunately, Bertram took the return pad with him, so we'll only get one shot at this.
Now we'll have to travel back in time to a point shortly before Bertram's arrival.
I can't be certain, but I'd say about 15 minutes.
But why would Bertram go back this far to get rid of you?
Ah, you're forgetting I initially encountered Bertram as a sperm in one of the fat man's balls, so he couldn't get rid of the fat man or any recent ancestor on my father's side.
Bertram had to go back enough generations to make sure he was snuffing out the ancestral source of my genius without affecting his own.
Well, we've gotta stop Bertram. What are we gonna do?
You're about to be yesterday's hopscotch chalk on a sidewalk, Stewie!
Yeah, no, I-I got the metaphor, but, Bertram, if you erase me, you'll destroy the universe!
Brian and I were trapped outside the space-time continuum and the only way for us to get back was to overload my old return pad!
So if you kill me, you're killing yourself and everything else that ever existed or will exist!
So I must have done, or will do, something that will save the universe.
The genetic material needed for my creation is inside me.
So I'll take da Vinci's place and pass it on.
All right, I'm going to send you back five minutes after we disappeared in the time machine.
If all goes well, the universe should be intact this time.
Hopefully, I'll be leaving you a future to return to.
The Vatican has been holding this note for you for about 500 years.
It was left to us by Leonardo da Vinci himself, with instructions that it be delivered to you on this exact-a date at this exact-a time.
It's been a week since you left, and I'm pretty sure I've set things right.
So I've built a cryogenic stasis device, and am placing myself inside it, leaving instructions for it to be buried in very specific coordinates in what will be future Quahog.
I will have spent the next 500 years buried beneath our basement.
Oh, well, shortly after you left, da Vinci's girlfriend showed up, so I injected her with my DNA.
I put a sample of my DNA in a syringe and I injected her on the staircase, the couch and the balcony.
You couldn't have grabbed me one of his original notebooks?
Mas onde estão os bons But where are those good- e velhos valores Old fashioned values-

E agora voltamos a apresentação exclusiva do Disney Channel. Aladdin 5: Jafar responde o Censo.
Sei lá. Digo, quem vai colocar as 3 revistas empilhadas bonitinhas na mesinha de café?
Lois, eu sei que está animada por viajar com a Bonnie e tudo, mas eu posso não ter que ouvir sobre a viagem quando você voltar?
Ã‰ sÃ³ que... Sei que vai trazer fotos e histÃ³rias, e eu...
Eu só não quero ser parte de toda essa bagunça.
Eu sei, e vai ser tão divertido ir com você.
Joe odeia voar porque sempre o colocam embaixo com os cães.
Aqui tem dinheiro para comida e os horários das crianças.
Eu sei. Terrível. Indo pra fábrica de Cheesecake de novo. Tão ansioso.
A seguir, nosso velho e horrível repórter Ken Redowski se enfurece com um produto que você nem liga.
Houve um surto confirmado de febre de bode no James Woods High School.
Todo ano, a mídia idiota tenta nos assustar com essas coisas, e todo ano, acaba não sendo nada.
Se ainda não está assustado, aqui tem uma montagem de pessoas espirrando em um balcão de saladas.
E aqui tem uma montagem de gente lambendo catracas de metrôs.
Aqui a de um homem com a gripe te pegando enquanto você dorme.
Enquanto a James Woods High continua aberta, estudantes devem lavar as mãos frequentemente e atentar para os primeiros sintomas da infecção.
Não acho que a Lois gostaria se tirasse as crianças da escola.
Agora deixe me te dar um banho inapropriado e pessoal enquanto eu fumo e o proíbo de ver seus pais.
Gostaria de me desculpar por ontem, quando eu dividi os parceiros de laboratório.
Fui informado de que essa é uma aula de inglês.
Chris, Meg, falei com seu pai no telefone, que me disse que precisavam ser removidos da escola.
Não acreditei que era ele mesmo de primeira, mas aí recebi outra ligação da mesma pessoa que achei que fingia ser ele.
Só estou vestido de seu pai pra enganar seus professores
Ele não tá em casa pois foi abduzido ontem à noite.
Não tem muitos negros por aqui, mas os que são, são muito negros mesmo!
Não vim até aqui pra ir em museus ou fazer compras.
Capacidade de aprendizado, sede de conhecimento... mas uma coisa que não precisaremos é isso!
Isso aí, sei que estão acostumados com professores usando ternos e capas do Drácula, mas esse não.
Eu sei que alguns professores pensam que aulas devem ser um exercício de estrutura, mas não o Sr Griffin.
Nunca vi nada como isso antes... um croissant com amêndoas nele.
Lois, já te falei, vim pra Paris pra ter um caso.
Não acredito que vai jogar fora todos os anos com o Joe por um caso bobo.
Olha, sei aonde isso vai dar, e não estamos interessadas, certo?
Me prometa que vai deixar de lado todo esse lance de caso.
Olha, nenhum casamento é perfeito, mas Joe é o homem pra quem você deu sua vida.
Você quer mesmo dar esse tipo de exemplo pra ela?
É que às vezes eu sinto como se nem mais conhecesse o Joe.
Certo, turma, essa aula vai cobrir todos os momentos significantes da história humana.
Começando com a chegada no Velho Oeste, onde pioneiros sobreviveram contra o ambiente hostil.
Querida, tenho que ir à cidade comprar mais suprimentos, então provavelmente vou morrer, mas se não acontecer, te vejo em 18 meses com um saco de sal e um jarro de gordura de baleia pras crianças.
Cavei covas lá trás pra todos vocês, no provável evento de vocês perecerem também.
Quando isso acabar, com certeza vou guardar a cabeça dela.
Mas anos recentes também viram muitos eventos históricos importantes. mais gay de todos.
Não sou bom em matemática e nem certificado pra dar aula de direção, então contratei um tutor de matemática e um instrutor.
Então, você usa meu carro, ou você tipo, trouxe um especial?
Bem, hora de aprender matemática de um negro, eu acho!
Dá pra ver um episódio especial temático de The Biggest Loser aqui!
Lois, não viu que eu amarrei um absorvente na maçaneta?
É o que costumam fazer em fraternidades quando temos... Companhia.
Por que todo dia é introdução a um curso novo?
Eu sei que alguns professores acham que estão revolucionando quando tem aula no jardim.
Bonnie, se eu fosse um gambá e você fosse uma gata que vagasse repetidamente em áreas com tinta fresca, eu olharia a listra nas suas costas e pensaria que fosse outro gambá.
Gostei tanto de sua intimidade, nesses últimos dias, ficaria aqui comigo?
François me pediu pra ficar aqui em Paris com ele.
Agora está me dizendo o que eu posso ou não fazer?
Te convidei pra essa viagem pra você aproveitar enquanto eu transava com estranhos, e é assim que me agradece?
Certo, turma, o teste final de hoje consiste em 2 partes: Oral e anal.
O surto de febre de bode na escola acabou e honestamente, receio que não estamos aprendendo nada.
Lois, pensei muito no assunto, e não vou com você.
Entendi. Sabe, eu achei que diria algo assim, e é por isso que liguei pra alguém que talvez te faça mudar de idéia.
Me desculpe se tenho sido egoísta, mas eu te amo, e preciso de você.
Prometo que leva 3 anos com esse sotaque antes que perceba que sou apenas outro babaca.
Ele pode até ser, mas eu faço tudo por você.
Bonnie, não achei que chegaria a esse ponto, mas vejo que só resta uma maneira pra eu provar meu amor por você.
Eu faria tudo em nome do amor, mas não faria isso.
Aquele lugar é só caras magrinhos, se esfregando em ônibus e metrôs, te cutucando na coxa com a coisa deles.
Mas pelo menos ajudou a salvar o casamento do Joe e da Bonnie.
Eu sei. Os dois pombinhos não saíram do quarto desde que voltamos.
Today's installment, Why they all needed to turn every vowel into the letter'A.'
The letter A, the A, the A, the letter A...
And also, we're missing a bunch of snow shovels from the storeroom.
I mean, we're in a galaxy far, far away, and we still have to change in Atlanta.
Hi, Darth. You got any bags, or did you leave Mrs. Vader at home?
It's you? Are we already out of our own characters?
Remember how last time they skimmed along a trench and then blew it up by shooting through a hole?
I was there when he came up with the idea for the Death Star.
CLEVELAND: You sure this is where we'll find Captain Solo?
Yep, this is it. Corner of Tatooine Way and Martin Luther King Boulevard.
CLEVELAND: Wow. There are all kind of manner of crazy monsters in here.
Yeah, and they added even more for the special edition.
I seek an audience with Your Slimness to bargain for Captain Solo's life.
As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift, these two droids.
Wait a minute, does he have the right to give us away?
You have hibernation sickness, but your eyesight will return in time.
Whoa! You are smothering me, and I need my space.
Yeah, it's me. I got caught eating out of Jabba's trash.
Well, I guess the good news is we're not being pushed into a giant anus in the desert.
It's part of the hibernation sickness. That and these lesions, and the fatigue that I've been feeling, and the persistent cough.
(GROWLING) I let him in. What, was that not cool?
I'm here to bargain for Han Solo and the rest of my friends.
Threepio, please. Whatever you have to say cannot possibly be as important as this conversation.
But you're standing on a trap door, and if Jabba pushes the button...
There's a huge monster down there, and if Jabba hits the button, the trap door's gonna open, you're gonna fall down into the dungeon below
Limbaugh Rule Number One, no tax-dodging Jedis in my pit!
CLEVELAND: Oh, Luke! Did you want me to throw you your lightsaber?
Just so you know, the compartment I keep your lightsaber in is my rectum.
The mighty Jabba has decreed that you are to be thrown into the Sarlacc pit.
There, you will discover a new meaning of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
I'll be sprayed all over the desert in a week.
Right? Big lips on a stick knows what I'm talking about.
It's this disgusting, horrible creature that's worse than anything you could ever imagine.
But, should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
Please don't kill us! We won't do it again, honest!
We'll be good, mister! We was just fooling around, is all!
All right, when I give the signal, we get him!
Wait a minute! What are you doing? I thought you were blind!
You want some laser hair removal, while I'm at it?
You've reached Han Solo. Please leave a message after the blorp.
You know, he's from the program, and he wants to meet you.
Well, hey, Jeremy! How do you like the Death Star so far?
If you ever do that to me again, l swear to God...
They kind of just dropped him on me at the last minute. I couldn't say no, man.
There is one thing, though, and I'm sorry about this, but your room's not ready till 4:00.
So feel free to use our business center, or enjoy the pool.
Yeah, it's either Darth Vader or Paul Reiser, but they don't want to know which one is your real father, so they're gonna raise you together.
I'm getting really old and I'm not feeling so hot, and I think I might die soon.
When gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be.
Why, yes, I do have a credit card. Name is Yoda...
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me Vader was my father?
Why didn't you tell me you got a new hand?
But if Vader's my father, does that mean I'm vulnerable to the dark side?
Seriously, put your hand like you're gonna pull a carrot out of the ground.
Hey, just for giggles, you wanna poop in Yoda's tiny toilet, pretend he took a giant poop?
I'd like to thank you all for meeting me here, in the lobby of the Mondrian.
Hey, check it out, it's another chick! The only other chick in the galaxy.
The Emperor has made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.
We've learned that the new Death Star is not yet operational.
But, more importantly, that the Emperor himself is overseeing this mission.
So, let's pretty much just attack like we did last time.
Sound good? No need to fix what ain't broke, right?
Yeah, we did this already. That's what's so fucked up.
General Solo will take a stolen Imperial shuttle and knock out the shield generator on the fourth moon of Endor, while General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the squadron to destroy the Death Star.
Am I the only one with a gold star on their uniform?
It's just for record-keeping. Okay! Let's go for it, people!
Okay. Han runs an online employment website on the side.
Economy got you down? Stressed out? Worried about your future?
Come by and apply for your Han job, and I'll get you off and running.
Other websites jerk you around and don't finish what they start.
But with HANJOBS.ORG, we'll have you shooting for the stars!
But keep it down, my neighbors don't know what's going on in here.
All right, now remember, Lando, don't get a single scratch on the Falcon, okay?
Look, will you relax? I already said I'll be careful.
Well, just make sure you are. That ship's gotten me laid a bunch of times.
Hey, hey, hey, girls! Anyone want to make the Kessel Run?
I just got a funny feeling I'm never gonna see her again.
I was just ironing my robe, taking a look around. What's up?
Well I just wanted to let you know there's a rebel fleet massing at Sullust, and I think they're going to invade or something.
You made sure there wasn't a hole in the Death Star this time?
But, you know, it might be something to be concerned about.
It's of no concern! The rebellion will soon be crushed, and young Skywalker will be one of us.
We're still doing that initiation thing we talked about, right?
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Don't get jittery, Luke. There's a lot of command ships.
But don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Luke, take this gun. You shoot me, I'll shoot you.
CONTROLLER: (ON RADIO) Shuttle Tyderium, the shield has been deactivated.
Chewie and I'll take care of those guys, you stay here.
Oh! Can you play the theme from E. T., John Williams?
No, but I can do the theme to Entertainment Tonight.
Lando Calrissian is 42, and l Don't Like You, Either Guy is 63.
I think I've gotten over the loss of my home planet, Alderaan.
Luke, there you are! Where's Leia? Have you seen her?
She probably decided to make like one of these trees and leave.
I don't know. I stepped on it earlier. It was just here in the woods.
That's funny, because my friend lost his horn on the forest moon of Endor last year.
Or I will stab you with my very sharp spear.
Look, put that down. I'm not going to hurt you.
You are my enemy, and I want you off my planet.
By the way, I think you're about to start your period.
She's actually, believe it or not, better than the last one.
I thought I told you to wait on the command ship.
Yes, well, the thing is, a small rebel force has landed on the forest moon, and my son is with them.
No, no, Kurt was just a guy I was hanging around with for a while.
(STAMMERS) I mean, he was younger, but he wasn't that much younger.
Just some guy to, like, play ball with, and go to the movies, crash into real hard in the hallway.
You know, just guy stuff. You know, just a bro, you know?
Someone you can read the Sunday paper or share an orange with.
Honestly, Darth, I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.
(STAMMERING) Well, I don't know what you want me to...
Look, just go down to the moon and wait for your son.
Hey, maybe we get out of the woods before nightfall, on account of the ghosts and all.
No, Chewie, don't! If you talk to her, you have to talk to her mom!
You know, we were just mistaken for sisters over at the bar.
Remember that laser I used to break Leia out of Jabba's handcuffs?
Seems like everybody would turn out a loser in that situation.
Tell them if they don't let us go, you'll become angry and use your magic.
So, they use spears with wooden shafts and stone-carved tips, yet they clearly understand the finer points of cosmetology?
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) ...most of my days 'maxing, relaxing all cool b-ball no good trouble... neighborhood one little fight scared auntie and uncle in Bel Air.

Leia, I've got something kind of messed up to tell you.
I'm from Alderaan. It's kind of the Mississippi of the galaxy.
PILOT: Imperial shuttle requesting permission to land like a dainty butterfly.
Now listen, since your mom's out of town and I have you for the weekend,
I thought it would be fun if the Emperor and I turned you over to the dark side of the Force.
Daddy, if I may, I'd like to throw out another option.
Hang out with me on the lighter side of the Force.
All right, so what do you say? You want to go see the Emperor?
Gotcha! Oh, my God, we're going to have so much fun.
When we arrive at Endor, we will destroy the Death Star and then begin setting up the Ewok reassignment camps.
I say when we're done with this, we go over there and fry him up in a skillet.
All right, here goes nothing. I'm going to sneak up on that guy.
Oh, my God! I can't believe I fell for that.
I know. Now, excuse me, I have to make out with my girlfriend.
Hey, take your helmet off. I'll do got your nose.
We're not supposed to take these off, but I really want to see that.
Yeah, that's why we wear these big helmets. It's a lot more intimidating.
I'll be honest with you. I don't like people who are different.
I thought you should know, young Skywalker, that your friends are walking into a trap.
Wow. You're white? You totally sounded black on the phone.
Silence! You will turn to the dark side, and your precious rebellion will be destroyed.
(MOCKINGLY) I'm afraid the shield generator will be quite operational when your friends arrive.
Jeez, you don't have to be a dick about it.
All right. Now I want you to take off your helmets, go outside and dig your own graves with them.
Shut up! There's enough cutesy crap in this movie. l think we all need this.
Kill him. Take this knife and stab him in the mouth.
Shut up! And after he's dead, cut off his face and wear it as your face.
And then go home to his family still wearing his face, and see how long it takes them to figure out that it's you and not him.
Wow. What a voice! Do you mind reading this for me? Paging Mr. Herman, Mr. Pee-wee Herman.
What do you mean, we can't get any reading on the shield?
Man, only thing I'm reading is Cat in the Hat.
Lando to Enterprise! Draw their fire away from the cruisers!
Oh, yeah. Those Ewoks had all of five minutes to get things prepared.
And here's something that's gonna piss you off even more.
Gee, Dr. Smith, this doesn't seem like a very safe place to be.
Look at that! Blowing up rebel ships! Bet that gets you going.
Come on. Take that lightsaber and try to strike me down, and your journey toward the dark side will be complete.
I've seen a lot of ships get blown up. It's no big deal.
Yeah, I guess that wouldn't get under my skin, either.
Greg the Bunny, Four Kings, and that godawful puppet show.
Well, I think he's had some successes. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was popular.
It was not popular. Entertainment Weekly said it was popular, but it wasn't.
What, because of Seth Green? Do you ever hear anyone say, Hey, let's go see that new Austin Powers, Seth Green's in it?
You're talking about an actor who I happen to enjoy.
'cause in that show, he was playing himself, an asshole.
Oh! Sorry. (LAUGHS) This is my joke lightsaber. It's cute, right?
Join us, Luke. Turn to the back side of the Force.
Oh, my God! I meant to hit you in the shoulder, and that whole thing just fell!
I don't know. He was up there like, I can't do this, I threw the thing, and I just meant to hit him in the arm, and then the whole thing fell.
We're lucky if we come out of this without a lawsuit.
Okay, now you're in a laundromat, and there's only one available machine, and you're fighting over it. Go!
Oh, God! It looks like all these machines are taken.
If anyone asks, I shot him. Got that? You were crying in the corner.
Hey, why don't you blast open this door, and then we can...
Whoa! What do we have here? A fully formed beehive!
Must have taken months to build that guy. Well, guess what? (EXCLAIMS)
And you gotta hand it to Seth Green. I mean, he works hard, you know?
I mean, the work is much harder when you know the project is no good.
I wonder if his fan base knows how Jewish he really is.
Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side.
Can we at least put together a press release that says I'm resigning of my own accord to pursue other evil projects?
The shield is down. Commence attack on the Death Star's main reactor.
The shield may be down, but they've gone into glitter-ball mode.
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.
Father, please! Please! You know what? You have nice manners.
I'm so delighted that Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen took the time to teach you nice manners.
And just for that, I'm going to help you out here.
Let me look on you with my own eyes, father to son.
Ahhh! Oh, no! He's dead because of what the Emperor did a while ago!
Some like it hot, and some sweat when the heat is on.
Hey, Leia, you got a date for the We Just Killed Thousands of People Dance tonight?
Come to think of it, you can shave your yub nub for me, too!
And that's the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.
Dad, one question. What do you got against Seth Green?
I just think he's a douche. You got a problem with that?
For example, me, l think Seth MacFarlane is a douche.
Wait a second. I hear he's a pretty nice guy.
Yeah, he watched TV in the '80s. We get it.
And he only puts out, like, ten new episodes a year.
And then he splits those up into five DVD sets.
But he still takes the money every week. How noble.
And doesn't he have a whole staff that writes those episodes anyway?
You-you... you want, like, a... a ride to the place?
What's going on, Lois, is that this girl is obviously not well, and I have just learned that she's been stealing from the show, and she should probably be escorted out of the building.
We now return to Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, edited for goats.
Marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet.
I just want to yell at customers when they walk in the door.
Peter, you're not getting money for that or anything else.
In fact, I may have to get my own full-time job.
Geez. Are we really living that close to the edge?
Why do you think we waited so long to take you to the groomer's last month?
Hey, isn't it time for me to get a haircut?
Yeah, I'll check, but I'm pretty sure it's not for another couple of weeks.
Like it or not, we're going to have to start living on a strict budget for a while.
I thought you were going to sing with me, Joyce.
The Rhode Island State Lottery has climbed to a record $150 million jackpot.
Mayor West, what do you plan to do if you win the lottery?
Well, I'd finally splurge and buy myself one of those fancy four-piece suits.
And how about you, every Persian guy in the world?
In fact, I'm going to go buy my winning ticket right now.
Simple. I took out a second mortgage on the house.
Your odds of winning are like 100 million to one.
Don't you know the lottery is just a tax on stupid people?
Would you be saying that if the prize was 150 million bags of the neighbor's garbage?
I got lots of good karma built up from doing those USO shows.
So, apparently, they found a weapon of mass destruction-- my putter.
Just wanted to remind you fellas what you're all fighting for.
We're here live in our studio where a checkout girl in a cheap dress who wants to be a model is ready to draw the winning numbers. E!
All right, kids, we got 200,000 lottery tickets we got to check.
A static shot of the house where night turns into day or a montage song that over-explains what we're doing?
Um, that second one sounds like it could be funny.
And seeing if they match the ones on the news
So, in addition to buying you had 400,000 fake ones printed up?
Now that we're rich, our lives are going to be so much better.
You sure it was such a good idea to cash that lottery check?
It seems foolish to have all this money lying around.
Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank where the Jewish guys can leer at it?
All right. Call me when you blow all your money.
All right, so how are we going to spend our winnings?
I'm going to get some supermarket fried chicken and eat it until I'm nauseous.
I'm going to finally get my gal that doodad she's been wantin'!
I'm going to get a floor mirror to squat over and see what's making all that noise.
We're not going to go crazy spending our winnings, and we're not going to let this money change us.
This money is our ticket to the good life, starting now.
I just bought a giant room full of gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck.
It's a great many pieces of solid matter that form a hard, floor-like surface!
I told Angela what she could do with that job, just like I always fantasized.
Angela, I just want to thank you for several extremely pleasurable years working for this corporation.
Uh, certain unexpected developments have created a situation where I am no longer in need of employment.
Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk.
Hey, what's the point of being rich if you can't share it with your pals, huh?
Susan Boyle or a sex doll that's been passed around a fraternity?
Tread water where you are right now or increase your net worth fivefold within the next
Well, my friend Marty is a whiz with chemistry, and he says he's come up with a new penis enlargement pill, and if we can bankroll him $100,000 in startup money, he'll triple our investment in a year.
Peter, I've taken the liberty of mocking up some sales projections.
Bonnie's birthday is coming up, and I'll be gol-darned if I didn't go ahead and promise her that Stevie Nicks would come to our house and sing three songs to her.
Yeah, if you're going to open your mouth with the missus, stick to kisses, huh?
So what do say, Peter? Can you help us out?
Hey, Horace, give us three shots of your best bourbon.
And have that Russian waiter I like bring it over.
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Boy, you wouldn't guess from that smile that all his kids were stillborn, huh?
I told my mother I'd visit her in the hospital.
I-I just wrote you guys a couple of checks, but no, you... you-you-you do your things.
I-I thought friends hang out, do things with each other.
You know, especially when one friend gives the other friends a whole bunch of money.
Yeah, and I-I guess the co-pilot can fly the plane.
She's a woman and passengers are usually okay with that.
I once saw a deodorant commercial that had a woman pilot.
From now on, we're all gonna do whatever I want to do.
Good. 'Cause what I want to do is stay here, get drunk and watch TV.
Hey, Peter, you wanted me to watch the entire first season of True Blood and come show you where there was boob?
That's right, I don't want to see any actual True Blood, just boob.
And as for you, Anna, you're dreadful and so is the program.
How come everything he writes is so dreary? I don't know.
Okay, Quagmire, I want you to take the first bite out of this fudge pop, because that first bite is the one that really hurts.
Now, smear what's left of it on your face and look at me with your mouth open.
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do a synchronized duet of Makin' Whoopee while I shoot you with this BB gun.
Look, you aren't gonna shoot us in the eye, are you, Peter?
What the hell, Peter?! You shot him in the eye!
Keep singing, you. And keep your chin up, so I can see your throat.
Jerk? What kind of a way is that to talk to your friend who gives you money?
You know, Peter, you used to be a great guy.
I had to fight three rappers down at the Nonsense Store for this.
I'm worried the money is changing this family, and not the way you hoped.
Well, I was hoping it would make you shut up, so you're right.
You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning, and she said you haven't talked to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.
I don't like what this money is doing to us.
What, here? Yeah, I had a giant mobile put in the sky so I can sleep wherever I want.
Today we have a recent vintage procured just this morning from Michael's Hobby Shop.
We don't have to worry about paying bills, we don't have to worry about saving dough.
The two kids who found it were forced to murder each other.
Hey, you want to watch a DVD of the murder while we do it?
I already watched it eight times, so I know exactly which part I want to blam at.
Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father, you will try to impress me, and I will remain distant.
Hmm. Sounds like somebody's dad is happier than me right now.
And, Chris, try as you may, you will never be as good as your older brother who died.
Now, pardon me while I look at scrimshaw through a magnifying glass.
Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea at the Park Barrington every single day.
Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea of white faces, isn't it?
Waiter, have the chef prepare a bucket of your finest caviar, and then give it a helicopter tour of the city.
I hope it enjoys it as much as that Maine lobster I ordered.
And over there is the Rhode Island State House, the second largest self-supporting marble dome in North America.
Oh, don't worry, Carstairs, there's ample gratuity on there for you.
Well, I'm sure a brief call to my accountant will resolve this to our mutual satisfaction.
What about all that money I sent to the Gayman Islands?
Carstairs fell into a deep depression from which he never emerged.
Holy (bleep), we won twice and we're right back here again.
We had $150 million, and we blew through it in a month.
Yeah, but on the bright side, if this hadn't happened, we never would've met Kyle.
And they'll care what happens to us, even after everything that's happened.
You know, I'm still young enough you can drop me at the fire station, no questions asked.
Winning the lottery was the worst thing that ever happened to me and my family.
I thought being rich would solve all my problems, but all it did was make me forget what was important.
I don't expect you to forgive me, but if, for some reason, you do, you can find me in a cardboard box on the corner of Meeting and Thayer.
The penis enlargement pill you gave me the startup money for.
I guess it's only fair that I give you my percentage so you can get your house back.
And if it makes you feel better, it was money well spent.
Boy, I got to say, it's good to be home.
Yeah. Despite all the ups and downs, things turned out for the best.
I mean, really, we're no worse off than we were before.
All right, let's just go to different rooms and stare blankly out the window, saying nothing.
Our top story tonight, we continue to track the progress of Hurricane Flozell.
The National Weather Service has issued a Severe Hurricane Advisory, and is urging everyone to stay indoors for at least the next 36 hours.
Aw, crap. And I was going to watch G.I. Jose.
(with Spanish accent): Hey, kids... if you have an open wound, get some dirt or kitty litter and rub it in there to stop the bleeding.
Then get some sleep and wait for the body to heal itself.
(sighs) Okay, I'll tell you; but you can't tell anyone.
All-All right? You have to be really cool about this.
Makes you see weird things and feel happy for a few hours.
I figure we're going to be stuck inside f a while with this storm, so it'll be a fun way to pass the time. Okay.
I-I-I-I have a lot of friends who do it, and they're willing to do it around me all the time, because they know I'm so cool about it and I don't judge them.
Yup, that's what my friends say, too. Well, here we go.
How about you all sit there quietly while I make Dad noises?
But it's kinda nice for us all to be together like this, huh?
I'm gonna finger-bang the two of you at the same time.
Oh, no one wants to get finger-banged by you, Meg.
Why don't you just go do that to yourself, Meg?
I'm gonna cut my ear off to prevent World War Two.
Okay, five minutes, Miss Ga-- (like Jerry Lewis) gina big!
Okay, I'm gonna sing the opening chase music from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
(can pops; music stops) Dammit, Meg! Will you stop that?!
I am sick of all you guys ganging up on me!
You guys all think you're so much better than me!
(eerie male voice):  The wheels on the bus go round and round
Let's get you downstairs so you can drink some water.
All right, let's go, buddy. Let's get you some water.
Let me put the bowl down first. You're gonna spill it.
You're supposed to be on my side, and you're such a bastard to me.
Chris, you treat me like you hate me, and I don't know why.
What if I started calling you a fat, zitty loser, who has no friends and smells like an old woman who has birds for pets?
Is it too much to ask to be treated with a little decency from my brother?
Maybe show me some kind of kindness by not jumping on the Let's get Meg family bandwagon?
Look, let's not turn this into some big thing, okay?
You know, Brian, you may be a dog, but you're a pretty cool cat.
Meg seems to think she's taking some kind of stand here that's gonna make us all feel like we're inadequate.
Geez, look at those two. They're goin' at each other like an Italian guy and a black woman.
NARRATOR: Having been officially challenged by her natural enemy, the black female prepares for combat by taking off her many rings.
Meanwhile, the Italian male looks around to make sure the other Italian males are indeed seeing what he is seeing.
Sensing the impending battle, a flock of Jews flies quickly away, as avoiding confrontation is their best chance for survival.
Look, the bottom line here, Meg, is that you're just taking your own problems out on everyone else.
The shoplifter, the drug addict, the porn star, the whore who let Gene Simmons and Bill Clinton go to town on her?
What's your point, Meg? My point is that with all the irresponsible, reckless, idiotic behavior in your past, that somehow, somehow you have the nerve, the arrogance to consistently and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings.
From the moment you gave birth to me, I had to trust you.
To... to be my guide, to help me navigate the difficult, confusing, and vulnerable journey to becoming a person.
You're my mother, and you took a child's trust and smashed it into bits in a 17-year-long mission to destroy something that you killed a long time ago.
I-I don't know that I ever want to see you again.
And you never let Dad stir the paint anymore, whatever that means.
I didn't know you knew that, Meg, but I'm glad you brought it up.
All of those things you said about me are true.
I just have this horrible, overwhelming desire to point out faults in you.
Maybe it's because I'm self-conscious about being a bad parent.
Well, you know, I, I been sorta just hangin' back here, takin' all this in, 'cause I didn't think
I had a dog in this fight, but my money's on Harry Potter over there.
I-I-I don't know. T-T-Tell me, tell me what's on your mind.
Hey. That's Mister Mister selfish-ass Dad to you, young lady.
You are completely selfish, and totally irresponsible as a father.
You have no education, you have no interests, you just do whatever reckless thing you want to do whenever you want to do it without regard for anyone else.
Oh, oh, and when you're not terrorizing the community with your impulsive escapades, you're being a total jerk to your family.
You shove your daughter's face in your ass and you fart on it.
If someone in the outside world could see the way you treat me, you would be in jail!
You are a fat, lazy, abusive, blue-collar Irish Catholic dad who drinks way too much and barely makes enough money to support his family.
You've lived half your life, and you have nothing to show for it.
Your only arguable accomplishments are your kids, and look at us; we're a disaster. Eh, watch it.
You're a total and complete embarrassment in every possible way.
Oh, and where the hell were you when she was laying into me?
Do you both just have your heads up your asses?
Well, I don't like having to literally empty the farts out of your pockets whenever I do your laundry.
You're from one town over, so I hate your guts.
Then I could finally sleep in and not have to answer your stupid questions at 5:00 a.m.
You don't even like them! But you know I do, and you don't want me to have them!
You know, I've never confronted you on it, but I've often thought the same thing, Peter.
You know, that was, uh, that was pretty cool the way you finally stood up to everybody.
I mean, I, I meant every word of it, but... you saw what happened. What do you mean?
They all turned on each other like a pack of wolves.
Do you think it's possible that... that this family can't survive without some sort of lightning rod to absorb all the dysfunction?
I mean, it-- it's not ideal, but it's an important piece that maybe it's just my lot in life to provide.
You know, I think you might be the strongest person in this house.
No! I don't deserve no better than livin' with the shoes!
What? Mom, you're an amazing mother and all the things I said about you were out of anger, and I didn't mean any of them.
What I said about you was more about me being a rotten sister.
And Dad, I'm so sorry that I made you feel this way.
I took all my problems out on you guys, and that wasn't fair.
Oh, so this was all about you, it wasn't about us.
See, I thought it was weird that I was a bad dad.
Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin. Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use.
Peter, I thought we were going to have some family time this weekend.
Remember, fishing was my not-at-all-memorable job for two years?  No.
Jeez, I've never tried to make conversation with just Joe before.
All right, well, um, we should probably go find out what's keeping Quagmire.
Maybe one night we get dinner, just the two of us.
All right, but let's just watch the end of this clown porn first.
I get to pick the radio station, because that was awful.
Well, Miss Quagmire, your brother Glenn is lucky to be alive.
You know, we're all lucky to be alive on such a beautiful day.
You know, when we were kids, our mother used to sing a song when we were sad.
Come on, Brenda, a stupid nursery rhyme isn't going to wake him up, especially the way you sing.
Come on, Brenda, we got to get out of here.
Oh, thanks, you guys, for all your help through this.
And Jeff and I are happy to stay here with you for as long as you need.
Fine, then you call my cousin Terry and tell him we're not going to be at his karate recital!
Why do you always got to remind me I didn't finish high school?
Well, listen, how about I make us all some dinner, huh?
Why don't you call the cops like you did on Christmas?!
Oh, now you're calling me a liar in front of this cat?!
I just want to get to sleep and put this ugly night behind us.
All that unpleasantness with Brenda and Jeff was more than I can handle.
Where do you get off calling me a deadbeat in front of your brother?!
No, Jeff, a-a-all I said was that you were in between jobs!
Well, it wouldn't matter if you'd just pick up that night shift at the prison!
But then I'll be working a hundred hours a week.
I'm stuck in the middle of some bad stuff with my sister.
I know, it sounded like there was quite a ruckus going on over there last night.
I've tried talking to Brenda about leaving him, but I haven't gotten anywhere.
I was actually hoping you could talk to her, Lois.
She might open up more to you, you know, 'cause you're a woman.
Well, I guess she does need someone to talk to.
You know, you don't have to stay with a man who treats you that way.
You don't see how soft and gentle he hits me when we're alone.
Close your menu, so they know we're ready to order.
See, this is why Jeff corrects me all the time.
'cause of the punches and all, but it's just that Jeff's been so angry about immigrants.
Trying to get a straight answer out of a 23-year-old girl is complicated.
Out like, go out or hang out or just do something?
They've been with me three days now, and all he does is beat her day and night.
And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but then they're always like, Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?
Hey, Joe, can't you... can't you just arrest the guy?
I can't arrest Jeff unless Brenda files a formal complaint with the police.
I mean, w-w-what happens if one of these nights, he hits her so hard he kills her?
Police policy, we can't step in until it's too late.
But if I were you, I'd set up an intervention.
It's like a surprise birthday party, but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves.
I bet I would really shine at one of those.
All right, well, first we want to thank you all for being here for Brenda.
Now, I know it's going to be a long day, but we're all here because we care about her very much.
A lot of us don't like how Jeff's been treating you.
So we're going to say a few things, and then you'll say a few things, and then we'll be done.
All right, so we're going to go around the room and tell you exactly how your situation has affected each of us.
I feel like if he likes you, maybe you can change him.
Well, why don't you smoke a whole carton of cigarettes!
Look, I know what you guys are trying to do, but Jeff and I are fine.
Please, I'd like to say something, if I may. Brenda, the fact that you are being abused has affected my life in the following ways: The sister that I knew and loved growing up no longer exists. The person I see before me now is just a punching bag. And I call you 'person' and not 'woman' because a woman is a strong, beautiful, vibrant creature. A woman embraces life. A woman makes choices to make her life better. Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff, proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse.
Which is a perfect time for me to tell my jokes.
Glenn, I am so lucky to have such a wonderful, loving brother like you.
Hey, give me some money! I saw a cool bandana.
I'd show you the ring, but it's under the splint.
He's just gonna keep beatin' her, and then he's gonna beat the kid, too!
But you know, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days when a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his (bleep) ass?
We go over there and we do what's right; we kill the bastard.
You know, I could arrest you just for saying that.
I don't know what this cock-a-doodle-doo thing is, but it sounds gay and it sounds scatological.
Y-you think they ever suddenly wake up and realize the error of their ways and clean up their act? No!
They just keep ruining everyone's lives, and the world is better off without 'em.
It's against the law, Quagmire, and that's the end of it.
What the hell?! Did you change the channel while I was going to get a beer?!
Oh, yeah, I-I'm sorry, honey, I just wanted to see who was on Letterman.
His soft, gentle humor connects effortlessly with my mainstream sensibilities!
Boy, everything's different now than it used to be, isn't it?
You know, this morning I had a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal.
Yeah, yeah. When I was a kid, they were boulders!
Here's a bunch of words in a row: because the economy's so bad, they've decided they're gonna shut down all the prisons.
Get your lazy ass up and get my neighbors some beers!
We were just about to go on our annual midnight hunting trip.
Hey, it beats sitting at home watching Meg pop her zits.
Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes of kissing first or Eddie Izzard in drag, but he has a working vagina?
I was pretty surprised you wanted me to come along.
Well, then what the hell are we doing out here?
I'm just gonna point my gun straight at his head before he even knows what's going on.
You have to bring your friends out here with you to do your dirty work?
Not unless you want your friend's brains all over the place!
Listen, Jeff, just put the gun down and we'll forget this whole thing, okay?
I'm taking Quagmire for a little ride, and you guys are gonna stay out here and freeze to death!
That's okay. You can keep 'em the way you had 'em so it covers your stomach.
Thank you. You know, if this Jeff was around more, we wouldn't have tried to kill you.
Well, Quagmire, sorry it had to end this way; a tragic hunting accident.
I guess that little baby's gonna grow up without an uncle.
I think... I think you got a brother, too, don't you?
You know, if you had any balls, you'd put that gun down and we could settle this like men.
That's awful big talk for a scrawny bastard like you.
Jeff didn't come home last night and he hasn't called.
Uh, well, actually, about that, Brenda, he must've left early this morning.
Yeah, we found this note he left you. Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you. I realized that you are too good for me, and you and our unborn child would be better off without me in the picture. Love, Jeff. P.S. If the cops ask, tell them that Joe, Peter and Quagmire were with you last night. If you tell anyone otherwise, I will come back and not only hit you, but I will murder you. And no one will care because you're garbage.
And your baby is going to be a child of garbage.
Plus, she kinda is garbage, Quagmire. Well, I best be rolling on now.
And you just added that part about Grape Ape. P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape.
I was very brave when the doctor gave me that shot, wasn't I, Lois?
Even when I knew that he was gonna give me the shot,
I just k-kept looking at him in the eye and talking to him about my summer plans.
Yeah, except for having to sit next to that screaming autistic lady in the waiting room.
I don't know what you want! I don't know how to help!
I seem to be lost. Can you guys help me?
From The Proposal and The Change-Up and a ton of upcoming stuff? Yeah, that's me.
I was on my way to Newport and I kind of got turned around.
Ofourse, Mr. Reynolds, we'd be happy to give you directions.
You take 138 to the Jamestown Bridge, and you're gonna follow the...
I just went to the doctor, got my cholesterol checked.
Wow, why does a guy in his 20s need to get his cholesterol checked?
Came right up to me, like I was just dying to meet her.
Brian, I'm just going to sit in the car till the song's over.
All right, but don't take to long; it'll drain the battery.
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl...
Now I can do a slow cruise past my ex-girlfriend's apartment.
Lois, that dog with the different colored eyes is back.
No, this is what Bob Barker's been talking about all these years.
Well, believe it or not, they've decided to shoot my movie in Quahog instead of Newport.
I'm playing Hitler, but he's a young Hitler and he's got a rocking body.
I'm standing out here without a shirt on and my pajama bottoms are riding insanely low on my hips.
So I'm having this housewarming thing tonight, and I'd love it if you came by.
Anything beats what goes on at my house Friday nights.
All right, let's see, new novel, new novel, new novel.
A guy... a guy who loses everything, but finds his soul in Canada.
And the whole book is an e-mail to his daughter, who's dead.
That's just for e scholars a hundred years from now.
Well, I'd say we need to put on some tunes.
Hey, welcome back to Weenie and The Butt on 97.1.
And that was Baby by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris, which means it's time to give away some Justin Bieber tickets.
You know what I should do, just, like, as a goof?
I should try to win those Justin Bieber tickets just so I can, like, tear them up or use them to go to t concert.
Oh, my God, Brian's gonna be so mad at me.
I'll just get a little bit of paint and cover up the dents.
Ah, now that I look closer, yeah, I think that's what it is, too.
Is it me, or did she just make that weird?
So it-it looks good like this? Yeah, it looks good.
Hey, I got, I got, like, an insider Hollywood question for you.
Hey, hey, so what's all this about, everyone in Quahog likes to tickle fight?
I mean, they also said that people who pretend not to have heard of it are chicken.
Wow, you got a lot of catching up to do, and tomorrow night in the dark, huh?
This might be totally off the wall, but are you doing anything Thursday night?
You know, Ryan, most people take one look at me and just assume that I have plans, so I never get asked out.
I would love to do something with you on Thursday night.
Yes! Oh, my God, right now would be the worst time for you to tickle my lower abdomen, because it's so exposed 'cause I'm cheering.
We now return to the end of a depressing 1970s sci-fi movie starring a guy in a turtleneck.
Oh, I had to stop that last sentence in the middle because I was so surprised.
I- I was laughing at that funny thing you said at dinner the other night.
Um, y-you remember what you said about Lois's, um, patoes au rotten?
Well, I don't know, man, but the good news is, it-it doesn't look all that bad, Brian.
It's just, it's that spot right there that's upsetting you, right?
All right, I have covered for you plenty of times before, but not this time.
This is very dangerous, and have to make sure you never do it again.
Sometimes in life you just have to accept what's coming to you.
Like the contestant who gets the lesser showcase on The Price is Right.
And what better place to relax than in your brand-new hammock?!
This sturdy and portable hammock from Swingway turns any patio into a tropical paradise.
And you can entertain yourself on your patio by drawing with chalk!
Yes, Pratt and Millwood eight-color pastel chalk will turn your patio into a tropical art studio.
But you'll have to pack your chalk because you're going to be staying six days and seven nights at your parents' house in Wilmington, Delaware!
Um, hey, thanks for taking me out to dinner, Ryan, but I got to say, this food looks a little weird.
I don't know. Looks like it might give me the kind of farts
Sometimes I put them on, and I'm thinking I look all balls.
Hey, have you noticed what a jerk the mailman is in this town?
Peter Griffin could crush a baby bird with his bare foot while I watched.
I'm gonna be in so much trouble when they find out I wrecked Brian's car!
MAN WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT: We now return to popular Russian cartoon, Shoe and Shoelace.
At least I'm not getting stabbed by some random guy on the street.
And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on the plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers.
For example, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around, watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but who after you told her of your intentions, said, Go get him, child, in flagrant disregard of all newly-implemented post-9-11 security measures.
And if you were considerin bringing a boom box to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs.
It's true. Last night we were at this restaurant, and he tried to gay kiss me.
Why would any man dress well, groom himself and lift weights just to sleep with other men?
Well, I don't care what you say. He likes me.
And we do have chemistry, I- I won't deny that.
I- I... I will take responsibility fomy part in this.
I'm just gonna go over there and let him down easy.
We used to make you use the bathroom at the gas station.
I was thinking we could do some nitrous and then have dinner in there.
Look, Ryan, you're a great guy and everything, but I don't like you in that way.
I mean, there are some things that I would do with you, but my heart wouldn't be in it.
That you like me, and you want to be my boyfriend.
Look, look, look, let me... let me put it to you this way.
I'm attracted to you in the way that a man is attracted to a woman, but I'm not gay.
When you live out in Hollywood, you learn that life is about different spirits and energies you meet along the way.
I just thought maybe our spirits could intertwine, you know?
I- I have so much to learn about show business.
I could never really be attracted to somebody who uses labels like gay and straight.
It was a nice thought, but I think we should go our separate ways.
Which, by the way, is not a special occasion in the normal world.
Look, I thought about it, and to be honest, it's probably my fault for leaving you alone in the car.
And if you promise never to do it again, I won't say anything.
Hey, listen, I got something really cool I want you to see.
Yeah, but don't tell the other dogs in the neighborhood.
There's one tennis ball out there that's even cooler 'cause I peed on it.
Well, if you could recall exactly when you buried it,
It's our house, but somehow it looks a little different.
Meg, you don't need to change the way you look.
You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image.
She sounds like someone who's about to give up a huge opportunity.
You look like a prize at some Mexican church carnival.
You know, when you were born, the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille.
Geez. What, did you carry a thesaurus around with you?
You know, it's amazing I could speak at all with that circumcision still healing.
Just make a mental note of where you buried it, and as soon as we're back in the present, you can dig it up then.
Because we can't risk doing anything that alters the past.
Brian, there's one rule of time travel, and that is:
Do not alter the past in any way or the consequences could be dire.
Hey, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on.
Peter's eye did that weird creepy thing where it went over his nose.
Oh? Remember when you got drunk off the communion wine at church?
And then there was that time at the ice cream store.
I mean, I know we're not supposed to mess with the timeline, but should we call an ambulance?
And remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia?
Oh, my God, is that what we did back then?
Yeah, I mean, now, we just like return text messages and screw around and whatnot.
All right, look, we found out where your ball is buried.
Hey, wait a minute, Stewie, I got to take a leak.
Will it screw up the timeline if my future pee goes in a past toilet?
Uh, no, as long as it goes in the toilet.
One splash on a magazine in there, and we're getting chased by dinosaurs.
I shall cleverly disguise this lethal plasma disruptor device as a tuna fish sandwich, whereupon I shall end that wretched woman's Draconian reign of tyranny!
Look, I can prove to you that I'm you from the future.
The Stewie from the past has a lot more gadgets and things than I do.
Okay, take a last look, 'cause we're out of here.
There's the old gang we've gotten to know so well over the years.
The air is electric here at Super Bowl 33 tonight.
For some reason, the time machine didn't take us back to the present.
Amazing. You can barely drive a car, and yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?
Oh, no wonder the return pad didn't take us all the way.
I found a way to convert it so it takes D batteries instead of uranium.
Only problem is, I didn't bring any cash with me.
Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the sooner they'd, uh, catch their mistake.
Look, why are we making a federal case out of this?
Hey, is there any place around here that sells batteries?
Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all.
Um, I don't know if this is a weird question, but... can I have some?
All right, fine. Tilt your head back, and I'll lean my liquid down into your mouth.
Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times; he may even be downright, well, stupid, but I know he only accepted that money because he...
Yeah, the Super Bowl was cool, but frankly, no Tommy Brady, no Stewie likey.
Come quick, they're about to announce the unveiling of your statue on the news.
For stopping the 9/11 terrorist attacks and saving our country.
I can't even express how mad I am at you right now.
If it wasn't for you, those planes would've hit the World Trade Center.
I, uh, may have told my former self about 9/11.
Well, you remember when I said I was going to take a leak?
Our top story: Quahog prepares to unveil a new statue commemorating perhaps its greatest hero ever.
It was ten years ago that an almost inconceivable plot to destroy the World Trade Center was thwarted by Quahog's own Brian Griffin.
This amateur video captured Griffin's heroism in the face of a shadowy terrorist organization called-- holy (bleep), look at all those vowels--
Tell them to ground every plane out of the East Coast.
And thank God their follow-up attack on St. Louis was a bust.
Brian, I promise you, all of this can only end badly.
Nine Southern states have declared that they are seceding from the United States.
The announcement came from former President George W. Bush, who reformed the Confederacy after a bitter loss in his 2004 reelection bid.
Yeah, he probably couldn't exploit people's fears with no 9/11.
Bush appeared before the press today to make this brief statement.
If anyone out there can get their hands on a clown's suitcase,
I'd very much like to see what's inside of there.
Uh, okay, that was George W. Bush declaring civil war on the Northern states.
Look, Stewie, this doesn't necessarily mean things are going to turn out badly.
In fact, I bet, five years from now, the world will still be better off for what I did.
Well, Brian, if you're that sure of yourself, then let's go five years into the future, and you can prove me wrong. Fine.
I think I can do about seven minutes worth of funny stuff with it.
That should get us to the Meg kissing booth story.
You know, I just want to say how nice it is to be back here with y'all on Spooner Street.
Chris, I heard you got a D on your report card.
Okay, maybe things seem a little off, but other than that, the world seems okay.
Me stopping 9/11 led to a world that's just fine.
You are out past curfew, and therefore, in violation of local ordinance.
It says here that the new American civil war you set into motion ended up in a series of concentrated nuclear strikes all along the Eastern Seaboard.
Well, the only way to fix this is to return to the moment when we first arrived in the past and stop you from spilling the beans about 9/11.
Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on.
Whatever you do, you cannot tell your former self-- that Brian-- about 9/11.
If you do, America as you know it will cease to exist.
We've been here two minutes, and already you've destroyed America.
Also, if you don't give that Stewie a back rub, it really messes everything up.
Wow, that... that probably wouldn't look very good out of context.
Must be weird hanging out with us Muggles, huh, Brian?
All right, you obviously have no self-control, so we've got to go back and do this again.
Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on.
Why? What they did actually turns out to be damage-free.
It's what you're about to do-- stopping them-- that causes utter bedlam.
It's what you two are about to do that ruins everything!
I can't follow what's going on anymore, and I'm assuming the rest of you can't, either.
What? What do you mean? I don't know-- one of them landed here with its throat slit.
But wait, if one of me is dead, then shouldn't all the me's be dead?
Okay, listen up-- everybody, get back in your individual time machines very carefully.
Just go back to where you came from, and stay there!
Now, we're going to do what we should have done in the first place.
Just to make sure there are absolutely no loose ends,
I've sent us back in time to the moment just before you and I originally arrived.
Just get back in your time machine, get back to the present, and stay there!
You gonna flap your lips or you gonna do what I said?
If I was successful in restoring the past just now, you and I will never have existed.
The chronological tangent that created us will have been erased.
Every time you step into that machine, you invite the possibility of altering the world as we know it.
Thankfully, the alternate versions of us were there to prevent us from doing whatever it is we apparently did.
You might be sitting here with a hole in your leg, but at least our present universe hasn't been affected.
NEWSCASTER: And we're back with our coverage of the Quahog Thanksgiving Day Parade.
This is Tom Tucker and Joyce Kinney live at the parade.
We've got some on-and-off drizzle here today, and we're a little w, as you can see, because, apparently, there are no awnings that exist anywhere.
Mysterious awning shortage ravages the Northeast, but miraculously has not affected Channels 2 or 6.
And here comes our first float of the day, Tom.
It's the James Woods High football team with their Not Gay Revue.
And here comes the Rocky and Bullwinkle float. (car alarm blaring)
Well, viewers, to top it off, that's the Channel 5 news van you're hearing.
You don't have to put the key in the ignition.
Okay, well, I guess it's broken, then, and there's nothing we can do about it.
'Cause his bum doesn't open up to poo anymore, and a nurse has to go digging up there to get up after his stuff?
It was on Thanksgiving that their son Kevin got killed in Iraq.
Well, we're just glad we can have people over again now that that giant crab's gone.
It's a big balloon, baby, just like you're a baby.
He sees a baby and knows that he's also a baby.
It's been a year and a half, and he still looks uncomfortable around his dad.
Oh, Glenn, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be back here.
Oh, yum. I hope they're the kind with the bone removed.
I don't want anything else today to get as tense as that just got.
This is very nice, the time that we're spending together right now.
Sorry. Just making mental memories for when you're all inevitably dead, and I'm left alone.
No, he's right. I mean, sometimes chicks die, and it's not anyone's fault.
Now put on your glasses before you run over another black guy.
Hey! Who's gonna get the Thanksgiving dump trophy this year?
He threw up when he found out you were a monster.
MAN: Hey! Is there room at that table for one more?
Aw, and I stayed up all night writing dead kid jokes.
All right, you know what, I'm gonna do one anyway.
Well, I guess you replaced real butter as the star of the dinner.
In some ways, Army life in Iraq is what you'd expect, what with the blistering heat, the constant sense of impending danger, and the one gay soldier awkwardly avoiding the use of pronouns.
Okay, well, just send Swanson's parents a letter saying that he's dead, 'cause those are already printed.
I woke up from the coma last week, and I flew straight here.
Hey, when you get sexually abused while you're in a coma, do you know it's happening and just can't do anything about it?
Hey, Kevin, you know I put a yellow ribbon on my car for you guys?
And-and a little thing that says I support the troops.
'Cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you guys. but I don't have any change on me right now.
Well, all that matters is that my boy is home.
Kevin, I want you to meet your little sister, Susie.
I guess we got some catching up to do, huh?
Hope you don't get scared when I scream and have night terrors.
Your mother and I are very proud of you, Kevin.
What with their regular bleedings when they got shot, did they even know?
And I don't want to be treated any different than before.
Just that you would say that means we should treat you different.
Come on, guys, let's give him all our best food.
Okay, now you eat up, and then we're all gonna go out back and play some Thanksgiving touch football-- excuse me: war hero Thanksgiving touch football.
I'll be a captain, and, uh, Mayor West, you can be a captain.
No one had ever stood up to me like that before.
None of my grandchildren had ever disliked one of my stories before.
I'm... I'm drunk, and I'm gonna throw the football too hard at my kids.
Peter, I think you may have had one too many.
(slurring): I work hard to put a cornucopia on this table, and you're out showing your lower ankle to every Tom, Tom, and other Tom in our village!
Right? 'Cause, uh, hurt locker means some kind of war hero thing, or something.
Pfft. My friends and I used to laugh about how fake that movie is.
I'm pretty sure that movie came out after you went into your coma.
Right-- no, no, uh, I-I-I was talking about a different movie.
PETER (slurred): The world has changed around me, and I'm mad and scared!
One-one time this homeless guy showed me his purple head, but looking back, I'm-I'm not so sure that that was really a military thing.
Wait a minute. I thought you said you flew straight home from Kuwait after you woke from your coma.
When did you throw your medal over the White House fence?
N-N-N-No, I-I-I told you, I flew to D.C., ditched the medals, and flew home.
I guess that was just his dirty hobo penis, huh?
Kevin, why would you want to get rid of your war medals like that?
All it did was put me in a coma and kill one of my bunkmates and cripple the other one for life.
Now, I thought earlier you said that both of your bunkmates were killed.
I barely even stared at that penis for an hour.
That particular strain of douche bag didn't arise until 2007, while you were supposedly in your coma.
Um, maybe it's time for us girls to hit the powder room.
First Pat Tillman lies about how he died and now you?
And it's my second favorite holiday, right after Pretend Not To Notice People's Race Day.
Oh, uh, today he's wearing yellow pants, uh, yellow shirt, yellow hat, yellow shoes.
Um, he's got that big necklace with the dollar sign on it.
Uh, he's always grabbing his crotch when he's telling a story.
Like the one about when he found out his mother is really his grandmother.
Uh, drives a Mercury Cougar with a crown on the dashboard.
Uh, he's extremely cut for a guy who never works out.
Look, maybe we should just let Kevin explain why he did what he did.
But then I saw what we were doing to the people of Iraq.
I tell you, that kid was strong-headed for his age.
We bring in this civilian who got killed in the crossfire.
Not the kid, but, like, the kid's dad's, like, coworker's neighbor.
He was 74 and he had actually tried to rape someone.
But just looking down at his dead face and knowing that he lived near someone who worked with the dad of the kid whose name I never found out, I lost all hope.
That's when I knew I had to get out of Iraq.
I call the cell phone duct taped to the side!
I knew the Army would never be able to identify who was who.
If you think that I'm gonna masturbate after this tonight, you're right.
We don't have to sit here and listen to this.
Well, where did you go after you left the war?
If I can guess a line in there, will you not read it?
I don't think you'll be able to guess a line.
Is it something like, Ice burns as hot as fire?
Okay, so then I went to Europe, Australia, Canada, all over.
I wanted to be with people who love me, no matter what.
Well, it sounds to me like you're a regular Benedict Arnold Drummond.
Well, we got, uh, we got The Cowardly Lion is Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.
TIN MAN and SCARECROW: No, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, I'm sorry you all feel the way you do.
But I walked away from an illegal war of aggression being fought 6,000 miles away from our shores.
So, what, you figured you'd just let 'em get away with 9/11?
And the war we started in Iraq has killed a half a million of their people, which is like 200 9/11's.
So, I guess those moments of silence we had at those sporting events meant nothing to you.
Son, your job isn't to decide whether it's right or wrong.
No, I'm just saying that blindly following orders has resulted in the deaths of millions of people throughout history.
You know, I have not talked to Carol all night.
Look, I think you guys are all rushing to judge Kevin without knowing what it was like to be in his shoes.
He saw horrific things, in a horrific war, that only one other person here could possibly come close to understanding: Ida.
And I'm sure that Ida, more than anyone else here, can understand and support the choice that Kevin made.
No, Brian, I do not understand Kevin's choice, and I do not support it.
Son, when you go to war, you don't end up fighting for your country or your family or your flag.
You're fighting for your fellow soldiers there in the foxhole with you.
You walked out on those men, and that's what's most unforgivable.
If anyone has wanted whip cream on their pie, it's not my fault.
I can't get a (bleep) word in edgewise around here.
'Cause there's at least one Swanson man in this room who does his duty.
You took me out with you on one of yo shifts.
I don't care what you were trying to do, you broke the law.
Kids, Daddy has to go away for a while, okay?
I'll be the man of the shack while you're gone.
I just came over to tell you what a great guy your father is and how hard he's been working for all of you.
I know the law says I have to arrest you.
But sometimes the law is just a piece of paper.
There's right, there's wrong, and somewhere in between, there's life.
You knew what your duty told you you were supposed to do, but instead, you did what you thought was right.
Well, Kevin, I still can't say that I agree with your choice.
But I suppose sometimes a man has to do what he thinks is right.
You know, I think they kind of figured that movie was going to turn out to be bigger than it was.
It simulates all the fun of... of, um... w-what was it now?
It was like a... like a tall guy in a black hat and a cape or something?
Yeah, yeah, and there was the guy with the mask who wore a mask.
Yeah, and I believe he opened it at one point.
The rule is you can't look hilarious on this motor scooter.
Big news out of Six Flags Columbus today, as they unveil what promises to be the largest roller coaster in the United States.
The ride has several Jewish groups up in arms... as they go over the first rise.
I had heard about the Holocaust, but I never believed it till right now.
Peter, come on, they're not going to let you that ride either.
Yeah, if you want to ride that roller coaster, you're going to have to go on a diet.
Well, I suppose you can start by keeping a food journal, like Quagmire does.
Yeah, in fact, I got it right here. Today I ate peaches... ginger... honey... candy... olive... You know what?
All right, if that's what it takes to ride that ride,
And I'm not stopping till I look as good as my great Aunt Legs-Go-All-The- Way-Up Griffin.
Hey, baby, do those legs go all the way up?
Never had one, but somebody told me this is a really good way to start your diet.
All right, Peter, the most important thing when you're on a diet is willpower.
Now I'm going to put this steaming pie on the windowsill to cool.
Now no matter how many beckoning fingers that steam morphs into or how badly it tries to sneak its way up your nose, I want you to resist the urge to levitate off the ground and float towards the pie.
No, no, stay out of there. That's my special area!
Peter, I don't understand why we have to drive all the way to Ohio to ride a stupid roller coaster.
Yeah, besides, they're still not going to let you on.
A girdle is not a substitute for weight loss, Peter.
Hey, I'm riding that roller coaster, and that's all there is to it.
Now remember, there are no rules about who can wear stretch pants here, so you're going to see some pretty shocking things.
I'm sorry, sir. You're too fat to ride the coaster.
Yeah, why don't you go back to your pond, hippo?
He's probably off in a barn somewhere working on a contraption with that weird brother of his.
PETER: Well, this has given me a lot to think about.
We are going to have to send that family money.
Well, we're just going to have to find a local mechanic.
I don't think we're going to have any luck till Monday.
Well, I guess we better see if there's a hotel or something.
We do not see many of your folk in these parts, but we welcome all of God's children in their hour of need.
Well, actually, I think we need it for more than an hour.
The guys who oddly shout the name of their terrorist organization as they're attacking.
Look, they have the pictures of the snakes on their planes.
If there is anything we can do to make your room more plain, do not be afraid to ask.
A hotel in Amish country can't be any worse than staying in a youth hostel.
Uh, preferably one where I have to sleep with my bag taped to my body.
We have one where some Italian backpackers have laid out every item of clothing they own on all of the beds.
Will my bunkmates be constantly talking about me in a foreign language?
Uh, also, I'm going to have some mail delivered here, and I want it to sit in that box for four years.
We do chores and we watch other people do chores.
Alas, there are times when I feel as if there is much of life I am missing.
Yes, but only because people sometimes search for Amish farms on their iPhones.
I made you a playlist of songs that I like.
Most of my music I just get pressured to buy.
I suggest you stay away from my son, you harlot.
It's just that I really like this boy, but his dad...
Didn't realize how long it'd been since Ol' Dumper did his business.
All righty, well he seems to be all done now.
You'd think they'd know it wasn't in their diet, but this is how they find out.
Eli's father, Ezekiel, said that I can't see him anymore! (sobs)
I'd try to talk to Eli's father for you, honey, but I don't know if it's my place.
The only member of our family whose word would carry any weight would be Meg's father.
Like when I got stuck behind that giraffe at the ballgame.
I am sitting up, but I still can't see a thing.
Before we commence with Samuel Fisher's barn raising, let us pray.
Dear Amish Lord, thou looketh sternly down upon us thine flock, even though we did not do anything wrong and have been doing chores like (bleep) crazy, please make us humble, and deliver us more hardship, that we may get thick, calloused hands, much larger than other people's.
And grant that we become dull, like Eric Bana, who we have never seen, but are just going by reputation because it is your will.
We solemnly believe that although humans have been around for a million years, you feel strongly that they had just the right amount of technology between 1835 and 1850; not too little, not too much.
Please deliver us from Thomas Edison, the worst human being who ever lived.
And protect us from those who laugh at our buggies or our hats and deliver us from mustaches.
Look, I-I know you guys are busy with your barn raising and all, but, um, you know, I just wanted to tell you how much my daughter Meg loves your boy Eli.
I promise you, she ain't trying to corrupt him or nothing.
Mr. Griffin, with all due respect, we live in two different worlds.
I must do what is best for my son... and I have.
For all we know, Meg might want to Amish herself.
Plus, it is the time of the month when Eli's mother is on the burlap.
So whaddaya say, let the kids give it a shot?
Now on another note, I notice you don't have a damn lick of music in this town.
Your family must leave our community and return to the outside world.
I'm sure it's probably justified, but I'm begging you, don't punish the children for it.
A compartment in Eli's room where he stores his corn.
Look, Ezekiel, we would love to go back to the city, believe me.
Hey, Lois, watch me lay rubber in front of these losers.
Eli, I agree that your father was being somewhat unreasonable, but I don't think running away is the answer.
But I just could not bear the thought of never seeing Meg again.
We are, but Peter must have really pissed off my dad.
Ha-ha! I have done your chores to rob you of the joy of doing chores.
We-we can't be part of a feud with the Amish.
I didn't start this thing, Lois, but I'm gonna finish it.
Joe, go round up Quagmire and all the modern-day technology you can find.
Yeah, it's what I said before about the-the war thing.
What, again, was the nature of your beef with them?
I don't know. Something about a roller coaster. Let's go.
Call off your boys and let's you and me finish this man-to-man.
You were so worried about these outsiders coming into our community and corrupting me.
You have shown me so many wondrous things that have opened my eyes to the world beyond my home.
If this is what you have to do, then all I can say is...
(sighs) I am sorry there has been conflict between us.
And I know just the place for us to go and blow off all this steam.
So, Cleveland, you got to be pretty psyched about President Ubama, huh?
Well, I mean, you remember how a lot of people said, like, Oh, Ubama's not gonna be able to do it, but he's-he's hanging in there.
It's a black guy in a suit, let's just marvel at that.
Gosh, Cleveland, it sure is great having you back at The Clam, even if it's just for a week.
Well, the numbers ain't so good, so we got to do everything we can-- Hello, Lois.
You told me you were gonna clean out those boxes in the basement and put them in the attic.
I'm trying to keep you off the streets and off drugs.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you want to buy some candy bars so we can get some new uniforms for our baseball team?
You also promised you'd fix that shelf in the garage.
My name is Mike, and I'm somewhere else trying to make my own call.
You tell Peter he's in trouble when he gets home.
That's all my life is lately, just a bunch of chores.
I'm sick of Lois always making me do stupid stuff.
Bonnie's always making me do all these impossible household tasks.
Joe, make sure you get all the tire tracks out of the carpet.
It's a lot of work just to keep my single guy fridge sufficiently depressing.
Donna makes me listen to Gayle King on XM Radio 19 hours a day.
I tried to kill myself by swallowing a nail clipper, but I passed it.
We used to be able to do whatever the hell we wanted.
Now here we are, in the prime of our lives, and we're slaves to our women.
I know. An exciting day for me is when I watch wheelchair porn.
Sometimes the director has to come on camera just to turn the chairs around.
I don't know, like, maybe the four of us should do something to reclaim our freedom.
We got something to say and we ain't taking no for an answer.
We don't know how long we'll be gone, and don't expect a call from us to check in.
We will drive after a couple of beers and not make a big federal case about it.
And there ain't nothing you can do to stop us!
It'll give us a chance to have some girl time.
I'll tell you one thing, it's all about the beads down there.
It's just implied, but we all know what's going on in this thought bubble.
Boy, I'm sure getting my money's worth out of this rental car.
Would you rather be a hobo with a five percent chance of getting inherited by a rich guy or be Hitler two years before the end of World War II?
'Cause you know you're gonna have to shoot yourself, but you still got two more years as Hitler.
If you're the hobo, do you, uh, have a place to sleep, like an underpass or...?
As Hitler, can I change certain policies so that maybe I'm looked on more favorably at the end of the war?
No, you already screwed up big-time-- lot of dead Jews.
Am I a blue state or a red state hobo?
Dude, why do you keep trying to make Hitler work?
Am I allowed to kill other hobos to increase my odds?
Well, wait a minute, now how come I got to be crippled Hitler and he's still white Hitler?
If you got such a problem with it, Joe, just be the hobo!
These backwoods parts of the Deep South ain't a place you want to get lost in.
I read nowhere that Southern sheriffs really want to be talked down to by big-shot Northerners.
We're very sorry, Sheriff, and we want to cooperate to the fullest extent possible.
I'm an officer of the law, paid by this county.
And I can't help noticing you got a headlight out.
So what do you say we just work something out?
Oh, my God, why am I driving drunk when I could've been driving high?
Don't worry. I know how to speak this guy's language.
Front of the bus, back of the bus, middle of the bus-- you guys are doing great.
Yeah, I knew we were in trouble the minute I saw the jury.
You will be worked harder than you have ever been worked in your miserable, pathetic lives.
Yeah, you're real big when you got that stick, ain't you?
I feel like Natalie Portman thinks she's so much better than everybody.
Why does Laura Linney always look like she's just finished skiing?
Would you know who she was if I said Tyler Perry's Laura Linney?
Yeah, you knew it was gonna be hot when you heard that lonesome slide guitar and that hawk's cry.
You're my friend and everything and I feel bad saying this, but I wanted to see you fail.
Official prediction: when they let us out of here, we're gonna have to go through the prison gift shop.
Man, it's gonna feel so good to walk out of here tomorrow.
Yeah, you know, the time actually went by faster than I would have thought.
We left Quahog to find adventure and get away from all those lame chores at home, but I'll tell you this.
Looking back on it now, I don't think our lives are so bad.
When I get home, I'm gonna sleep like a log.
Hey, I'm gonna plug in the night-light if you don't mind.
I'm gonna go ahead and ask you to not do that.
Oh, hey, Warden, since it's our last night in here, can I have a glass of milk?
What?! But the court said we're supposed to go home tomorrow!
Oh, man, how the hell are we gonna do this for another 30 days?
I'm gonna find the biggest guy here and kick his ass.
Look, sometimes in life, you got to say, What the hell, and just go for it.
All right, if we're gonna break out of here, we got to get past these guards.
No. They're actually going to great lengths to avoid it.
Exactly. No one wants to watch a handicap struggle for independence.
That was easier than taking candy from a premature baby.
Hey, I got an idea for something that's gonna be so (bleep) funny.
You know, I'll admit it has its moments, but it's completely overrated.
I mean, I'm not saying I wrote something similar to it several years ago, but I am saying...
What? What? What? What? Hey, what are you doing?! Hey!
If he really starts freaking out, put your pinkie in his butt!  Aah!
All right, I guess this is the night bitches die.
Maybe there's something inside we can use to get these chains off.
You know, there's an awful lot of pictures of the sheriff in this house.
I'll bet a lot of people in town have pictures of him.
Oh, all right. Well, I'll only be home for a minute.
Some prisoners escaped from the work camp, and I'm helping the warden track 'em down.
Boy, I feel like I haven't eaten in a week.
Hey, if we pass a McDaniel's or a Burger Queen, let's hop out.
You boys are fugitives of my county, and I'm gonna take you back.
I put in a call from the McDaniel's pay phone while you guys were getting that nine-piece chicken McFingers and those Diet Conks and those Fresh Fries.
You know, you got some nerve driving around my town with a busted headlight.
You took an oath just the same as me, Sheriff.
Just 'cause you have a badge doesn't mean you can treat people any way you like.
And as a law enforcement professional, you have an obligation to be more ethically upstanding than the average man, not less.
Well, it's great being back in the North where people are civilized.
Yeah. And you know, I guess I learned something from all this.
Coming up, we talk to a man on the street while a man further back on the street flips you off.
But first, Quahog was hit by a major blizzard last night.
Here with more details on the snowstorm is Asian correspondent Tricia Nakahoma.
I'm standing here surrounded by snowdrifts, stalled cars, and the one douchebag who wears a tank top every time there's a blizzard.
Guy at work drank a quart of motor oil once and didn't even die from it.
Yeah, I just hope that weird albino up the street doesn't show up.
What are you doing out here in all this snow?
Lemon snow? You mean it just falls from the sky like that?
But you should have some before the other kids get to it.
I was having fun playing in the snow, and now you've ruined it, like a pizza place ruins a salad.
You're gonna want to know you've got an olive in your mouth.
It should be big enough to pretend you've got red teeth.
Well, we got these hot peppers, but you can't really eat them.
Oh, and make sure to stick it right on top of the pizzas so it stays nice and warm.
All right, Stewie, you all set to spend the day with Grandma and Grandpa?
He's going to buy you a soda and drive you around.
Hey, just so you know, we're not listening to a radio station.
What the hell are you talking about?! We're about to...
No worries. Now I can work at Hot Topic and make people sick as I ring up their purchases.
The egg that I was supposed to take care of for my high school project!
It's obvious your advanced age has impaired your ability to drive safely.
Please, Joe, I know he had an accident, but can't you look the other way this one time as a friend?
I didn't tell anyone about your Fiona Apple tribute video.
When a girl will break a boy, just because she can.
I'm late for a hostile takeover of a jelly factory.
It just seems to me that perhaps it's time to think about retirement.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, the gentlemen from Zurich are here for your 10:00.
Besides, you're always complaining that you don't have enough time to play polo or sit in a chair and moisten your mouth.
It does sometimes take me a while to moisten my mouth.
Retirement will be a wonderful adventure, and we'll do it together.
This Hall of Justice is sitting on five acres of commercial real estate.
Look, you may need to reach out to some wealthy benefactors for financial backing.
And he wouldn't want to lend us money anyway... I hear.
Well, we usually just sit here and complain about our lives.
Like this morning, Lois was such a pain in the ass...
Oh. I mean this, um, redheaded lady who lives in my bed was a real pain in the ass this morning.
Now that Grandpa's retired, he's gonna have more time to spend with us.
Yeah, all he ever does is ask you what you want to do so he can shoot it down and tell you what he wants to do.
No, you got to sit on the ground to eat.
I need a cushioned chair with back support like at Chili's.
Let's get in the car and see where it takes us.
All right, I just got to go take a misty, stop-and-go piss in your bathroom, then we'll be good to go.
Lois, how the hell much longer is your dad gonna be hanging around here?
I know, Peter, but he's my father and I don't know what else to do.
Well, I don't know how much more I can take.
Well, we were just thinking, now that Daddy's retired that you and he might be happier in a place where you can be with people your own age.
Well, we actually brought you a few brochures of some lovely retirement communities in Florida.
Mm, this one's even got the word sunset four times in the name of it.
These actually look quite nice, and we could finally get away from these dreadful winters.
Yeah. We'll even help you move in and get settled.
Wait a minute, why would I want to live in Florida?
Reminds of that guy who was way too happy he didn't get killed on 9/11.
Look at that! I stayed up late watching Monday Night Football and that saved my life, huh?
I'm Ryan, the manager here at Oceanside, and I'll be showing you around today.
First question, though: are you two old enough to be here?
Protect us, oh, Lansbury, from rude teenagers, from soup that is both too hot and too cold, and from anyone who calls, but please have people call.
Our state-of-the-art movie theater is equipped with some terrific innovations to cater to our residents, including a button on every seat that will pause the film whenever anyone has a question.
Well, we'll just need you to fill out this paperwork, and then we'll get you moved into your condo.
This place is nothing but old people marching to their deaths!
Hey, look, it's old man Withers, the guy who owns the amusement park!
I thought Carter and I were going to be so happy here.
I'll tell you what, Babs, let me have a talk with him.
You know, you remind me of a guy I know.
This guy worked and worked and never wanted to retire, even though it would've been the best thing for him.
Peter, get lost! I'm not gonna retire, and that's that!
Come on, Carter, everybody's got to retire at some point.
You give me just one day to show you how great retired life can be for an old fella, and I'll let you honk the horn one time.
Just fill this out when they say the letter and the numbers?
There's only one way to win this game-- wait for someone else to win and steal his card.
All right, Carter, now that you're retired, you're gonna need a whole new wardrobe.
And what better place to start than the Slightly Open Robery?
All right, Mr. Pewterschmidt, now, you know how in your building your office temperature was controlled by a central air system that you had nothing to do with? Yeah, I hated that.
Well, check it out-- this room has its very own thermostat that you can fiddle with.  Really?
Well, I am kind of warm. I'll try it out.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm glad you finally came around about this place.
Peter, I got to admit, it's not bad at all.
Never thought I'd get used to the idea of giving up work and just devoting my life to leisure.
I guess this is what people mean by the word relax.
Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood, and I'm required by law to inform you that I am a sex offender.
We use the abbreviation S.O's because it saves a lot of time over saying Sex Offender, because that's all we talk about.
Oh, my God, o-okay, we'll be down there as soon as we can.
He sleeps 18 hours a day, he refuses to bathe, and he's stopped making any sense.
Aw, that sounds like the sad little fat girl who lives in all of us and is struggling to get out.
Don't worry, you guys, I think I might know how to fix this.
Don't you see, Lois? When we forced him to retire, we took all the challenge out of his life.
Exactly! Now, let's see if we can put some fire back into him.
Margot, it's time to take this company in a new direction-- starting with being honest with the IRS about our profits.
And from now on it's against the rules to pat female employees on the fanny. ...like touching butts!
And tell the African-American elevator attendant he no longer has to wear white gloves.
Why don't you just tell him he can sleep with my wife, too?!
Don't you ever try to stick me in one of those retirement places again!
I plan on sitting behind this desk until the day I die.
Getting old is right for some people, but not for me.  I know, Daddy.
M-Mom, believe me, no one is touching you in your sleep.
And even if they are, so what, who are you saving yourself for?
Hey, look, I-I got to go. I don't know if we're coming to Thanksgiving. Because I don't know!
You guys, don't you think I'm a little old for the Teen Choice Awards? I mean, I turned 18 today.
Yeah, ever since Fox pulled this contrived night of  out of their ass, in an effort to get in on the awards show business, it's been very special to you.
I tell ya, every year, I recognize fewer and fewer names.
Plus we tally your text vote for the Biggest Whiff and Choice Bro-ment of the Year!
We're gonna kick things off with Choice Lacrosse Guy Smile!
Hey, what do you say we get some music in here, huh?
Give it up for our first nominated Choice Band of the Night, Peehole Skin!
We were supposed to open the door so everyone could yell surprise!
I thought you were gonna pay the kids from school to show up! I gave you $300!
Well, then what are all the cars doing out there?
Okay, the first rule of Jewish fight club is if somebody says, Ow, you stop.
But we had fun at the Teen Choice Awards, right?
Well, I guess we ought to call it a night.
No party? Oh, come on. I was gonna show a slide show of all those silly photos I took of Meg.
Well, Peter, a little birdie told me that today is Meg's birthday.
Oh, no. He's... Okay, well, he used to be Mr. Quagmire.
Anyway, this is a special day for you, young lady.
You got another member right next door if you ever want to talk and stuff.
You know, Meg, I'd love to see you without your hat on.
So, anyway, I'm on approach into Lambert Field in some of the worst turbulence I've ever flown through.
Everyone in the cabin was, like, Aah! but I kept my cool.
I trusted my training, and brought the plane in safely, and in fact, it turned out, ironically, to be one of the smoothest landings I've ever made.
Well, gosh, Quagmire, this has been a fun night, but I guess, uh, you better be getting home now, huh?
I guess I'll go home and rub out a giggity.
And then giving those names to other people whose butts I kick.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
We now return to Grainy Footage of a Potential Bigfoot that will surely spark a lively debate in your household.
Look at that. That is obviously a suit. It's a fraud.
We can't let Quagmire take Meg out on a date!
She's only doing this to get a rise out of us.
If we fight her on it, she'll only push further.
Well, she may not plan on sleeping with him, but you don't know how smooth Quagmire is, Lois.
I know! Isn't it? He practices vagic. Vagician was funnier.
Okay, well, the point is, we ought to be worried.
I used to do the same thing to my parents.
The problem is, they pushed back, and the results were not good.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, we pumped your daughter's stomach and we found vodka, Rohypnol, a fair amount of DNA that is not her own and a class ring.
Okay, let's say it at the same time and see if they're the same.
Gosh, Meg, I sure had a swell time with you.
Me, too, Glenn. God, it's so amazing that you've been my dad's friend for, like, years, and now we have this connection.
Hey, do you want to come in for some Crystal Light or something?
Well, I do believe in me, but it's getting kind of late.
Well, I'll try, but sometimes she can be as stubborn as a mule.
I tell you, you tell her to do something once, she does the opposite.
You know, it's like she ain't even heard you in the first place.
Even a brick wall doesn't tell you they understand you, and then go do the opposite, you know?
So it's no surprise to me that you're having these difficulties.
You know, whether it's just that she's not listening or whether it's that she's making a conscious decision to defy your wishes, who can say, you know?
And I would say, in some respects, having a strong-willed kid is a good thing, but it can get frustrating as hell on the other side.
And I want you to stay the hell away from her!
Besides, Meg is 18 now and you've gotta let go.
Look, Quagmire, you're one of my best pals, and I'm asking you not to do this.
I want to help you, Peter, I really do, but it's-- it's like you're asking a fish not to swim.
Oh, my God. I'm going to go poo now, so I don't have to later.
Look, Janine, I just-- this is-- I can't with you anymore.
I got to pee, but I don't want to move.
I guess you could pause it... but you can't pause me!
Hey, gang, got room for one more right in the middle of you two?
Well, now that you're with Meg, you don't need to be talking to, uh, Backbush anymore.
Oh, and I'll send a text to Possible Nipple Ring saying you're off the market.
All right, well, I better send a text to Backbush.
Dad, I swear to God, I thought you could flush those things.
A man she trusted to keep her safe and beautiful forever.
And two short months later, this is what happened to Joan Van Ark.
I don't want you to turn into a hilarious photograph.
Dad, I know what you're trying to do, and I want you to stop it.
I'm 18, and he keeps treating me like a kid.
Peter, I told you not to push her about this Quagmire thing.
If you push too hard, you're going to push her right into his arms.
This is a big game Meg is playing, and the only way to win is not to play it.
Would you go tell Meg that lunch is on the table?
She and Quagmire went up to his cabin for the weekend.
Yeah, I drew you a crude flip book to explain what's happening.
Okay, I got a little off track there, but they went to his cabin.
Oh, my God, I can't believe you knew about this and you let her go.
You said don't mess with her business, so I didn't.
It's one thing to rebelliously flaunt an older guy in front of your parents, but it's a whole other thing to go away with him for the weekend to his sex cabin.
Oh, don't worry, Peter, he's not going to sleep with her.
Look, everyone knows if you go away with a guy for the weekend and don't have sex with him, you're a huge bitch.
Oh, no, now I got to take care of the babies.
The reason being that you have sufficiently scared me away from your wife or daughter.
I plan to get help and use better judgment in the future.
Wait a minute, so Quagmire just changed all of a sudden, just like that?
Yep, I brought the ashes of my third grade teacher,
Mrs. Nicholson, and spread them across the lake, per her last request.
I know. I love the way the fire makes the shadows dance around behind us.
One time, my friends and I went camping, and nobody could start a campfire, and then I tried to start the campfire, and I could.
You know, we ought to get a  cabin up here.
Quagmire's in there about to have sex with our daughter.
And you're right, somehow it does taste better in my underpants.
Now get over here while the inside of your mouth is still freezing cold.
I'm 18, and you can't tell me what to do anymore.
You may be an adult, but you're still my daughter, and it's my job to protect you from errant wieners.
So, I don't care how old you are, you're going to do what I say and get in the damn car!
I will cut your thing off and feed it to Brian.
And Peter and I get this cabin for one weekend a month.
I don't want to see your face knocking on our door for at least a month.
Would you sign the guest book on your way out?
You know, Mom and Dad, I'm really glad that you kept me from doing what I was going to do.
We love you and we just never want to see you hurt.
I only wish I'd seen what was going on from the start, like your father did.
Well, I know the signs... because the same thing happened to me.
I was 18 and my body was firm from push-ups and sit-ups.
Little did I know this would lead to an eight-year-long psychosexual entanglement.
You know how the Asians look 30 until they're 60?
Of course, then they suddenly look 100, but cross that bridge, you know?
No, we're Japanese, let's watch a schoolgirl bang an octopus.
And of course the most important part of any workout is a proper cool down and a stretch.
Meg has spent two days pinned under a roof beam.
Oh, well, it's no wonder they finally caught you doing that in here.
I mean, the underside of your desk looks like Carlsbad Caverns.
So if I do this, I can talk about what a sweet rack she has?
Yes, but try not to make a boob-honking gesture with your other hand while you're saying it.
I'm used to people being a little uncomfortable with me at first.
Are your other senses better on account of you can't hear?
Like, can you smell my farts before they even come out?
'Cause I got one in the pocket right now, and I want to know if I need to feel self-conscious about it.
A lot of people make small movements when they fart.
All right, well, t-tell me if you can see when it happens.
I don't know why Lois always said she had problems with female coworkers.
So Abby, Elaine and Janet have their little lunch clique, and of course I'm not invited.
Well, I don't know, but what I do know is that in the staff meeting,  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
But when the associate sales manager came back in the room...
It's ridiculous, and I support you fully. ...she told him the idea as if it was hers...
It's nothing to do with you, and everything to do with them.
I didn't know you had a thing for deaf chicks.
They can do things to you that regular chicks don't even think of.
Uh, you're gonna start dating soon; probably good to get in the habit of chewing with your mouth closed.
Doesn't bother me, I'm just-- you know, one friend to another.
Yeah. This is what you are and this is what I am.
The old ones were so rough, and Stewie got that splinter, so I thought replacing the wood was the best way to go.
The other day, when you spent all that time at the drugstore.
Couldn't figure out if that Hispanic lady worked there or not.
I said, I wonder where the shampoos are around here.
Oh, for God's sake, I almost thought you were a regular person.
Yeah, well, you know, I read somewhere that women decide within the first seven seconds if they're interested in you or not, so I figured I wouldn't waste anybody's time.
Hey, don't worry, Brian, you're still doing better than Quagmire.
Listen, you know, we can do something else if you want.
Well, I mean, I just don't know how much fun it is for a blind person to go to the movies.
Brian, blind people go to the movies all the time.
I might be blind, but my brain has been trained to listen to any movie and know exactly what's happening on screen.
So you sure you don't need me to come in?
You might have to help me find it next time.
I'll just-- I'm-I'm just gonna lie here until the pain goes away.
We now return to the first time travel movie with a perfectly functioning time machine.
All right, if I'm correct, this should land us in six million B.C.
Brian, if I ever take up roller derby, what do you think my name should be?
I don't know how she does it, but she dresses really well for a blind girl.
Seeing-eye dogs are expensive; she may just be trying to get one for free.
So I'm-I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna avoid touching her until a little more time has passed.
And by the time I tell her, I'll have impressed her so much that the dog thing won't even matter.
Most people would say, I lost, I give up, but you, you just keep trying.
Always killing the guy in charge and saying, Oh, this new guy, this new guy's gonna get it right.
Well, that's just because I have confidence that I'll find happiness.
Look, you can't expect to hire 60 workers to dig a cave under your house and then keep it a secret.
Yeah, but I told them it was part of a geological survey.
I still can't believe you beat up that guy who tried to mug us.
Yes. May I help you gentlemen? Hey, you're in a tough part of town.
I don't care how many of you there are-- you're not taking this purse! Ah, the hell we aren't. Let's get him, boys!
Yeah, you like that, huh? Ooh! This guy's tough! No fair. He knows karate.
I can help you. You stay out of this, lady!
Well, they took the gift I had for you, but at least you're okay.
And that trip to the Eiffel Tower was just amazing.
That's the most romantic thing anybody's ever done for me.
You just need to be more careful coming down the stairs. That's all.
I'm beginning to feel like you're not attracted to me or something.
I-I just... you know, sometimes taking things slower is better.
I don't want to ruin anything by moving too fast, you know?
Hey, Brian, would you be cool with meeting my parents?
They're in town this weekend, and I thought we could all have dinner.
And since you can see... why don't you tell me how these look?
We're all supposed to have dinner tomorrow night, and her parents are going to see that I'm a dog.
Remember, I'm the guy who came up with the choreography to Showgirls.
I made a nest of my old underwears on which to lay my eggs, and I shall raise my young in this room alone.
Would an idiot have been able to rig this rig to that rig?
What happened is this one's a hero, is what happened.
Have that sort of crème brûlée face going on now, but he saved their lives.
Plus he's the only one of my patients to never ask me for hand work.
Never even tried anything when I'm giving him a sponge bath.
And yes, sometimes I graze it, but you know what?
That is the... the smell of backed up, unreleased genital essence.
I know we just met, but you seem like you're really good for our daughter.
What the hell? You're not gonna stick me with that thing.
I wanted to tell you-- I-I really did-- but I-I just thought...
I thought, if we got to know each other better first, you would eventually be able to see past it. See.
And I... I just... I really care about you, and I really want this to work, and I'm...
Do you think that you can still be with me?
I could have gotten over the fact that you're a dog, because I really do care about you and I feel like we had a connection, but I can't get over the fact that you lied to me.
And now you're going to have to watch me walk out that door.
Brian, I know you're upset about what happened with Kate and everything, but I did have one more thought.
Well, since Kate is blind, you could probably just do a different voice and go out with her all over again.
There's a huge rock right there, and it's covered up by grass and there's no way you can see it.
But someone else could hurt themselves, and, and a small cut is a, is a death sentence in these times, so let's just, you know, let's... let's get these rocks out of here.
And he's wiggling his nose and his little bunny ts
Kevin Smith 'cause he's too fat to ride a plane!
God, you know, I don't know why this guy's wife isn't here watching this stuff.
Yeah, I've been catching his library shows since there were only, like, three or four kids here.
I'm kind of known for having a twisted sense of humor.
Gosh, you know, our little Scotty seems to be having such a good time with your son.
Would you be interested in getting them together for a playdate?
Look at them. They're getting along like Billy Bob Thornton and his cat.
Stewie, do you want to be the Autobots or the Decepticons?
Autobots, Decepticons, gay, straight-- just pick a few robots, and let's party.
Oh, all right. Well, I'll be, I'll be this guy.
Look, why are you being such a dick about this?
If you could hear yourself right now, you would not stop throwing up.
You can't just put He-Man in Transformers' world, all right?
He wouldn't be able to get to Cybertron because he lives in Eternia, and Eternia is in an entirely different dimension.
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to The Post Roe vs. WadeBrady Bunch.
Mrs. Griffin, it's a good thing you brought this child in.
In fact, his lab-work shows he is suffering from Hodgkin's lymphoma.
I don't know, I didn't read the whole Wikipedia entry, but the good news is that what he has is highly treatable with radiation first, and if necessary, chemotherapy.
Look, do you have any idea how expensive medical school is?
Lois! We came as soon as we got your call.
I'm so sorry to have to tell you this, but Scotty has...
But you shouldn't have brought him to the hospital without talking to us first.
We don't accept medical care for ourselves, and we don't permit it for our children.
Is that, is that that thing all them gaybo Hollywood actors do to keep their stuff away from other guys' butts?
Y-You can't just let them just walk out of here!
And they said because of their faith, they don't believe in medicine.
Mom, I think there's a lot of religions that do that.
Well, that may be, Meg, but that poor little baby has cancer, and they're just gonna take him home and pray over him?!
And the only way to fight it is to make your faith stronger.
If you die tomorrow, you think we're gonna be devastated! But you know what?!
And maybe this dog will fetch a stick and bring me my slippers instead of prattling on about the pros and cons of various religions!
Peter, I have to go talk to the Jennings and ask them to reconsider getting treatment for Scotty.
All right, but try to keep your mouth shut, okay?
During his 22-year reign, this French monarch known as The Spider King had an ongoing feud with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.
Ooh, I'm sorry, Peter, we were looking for King Louis XI.
Ah, well, (bleep) me in the (bleep) with a big, black (bleep).
Well, that's what we wanted to talk to you about.
Look, I don't mean to question your religious beliefs, but as a mother, I just can't bear the thought of little Scotty not getting the help he needs.
Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy?
Oh, really? So with this book from the 1800s, you can pray away paralysis or terminal illness?
Well, then I'll tell you who you should really be praying for.
I just want to do anything I can to help your son.
I think you'll find that with God's love and a true belief, all manner of miracles are possible.
Look, I'm a churchgoer, too, but sometimes prayer isn't enough.
You know, Lois, this couch would be perfect for one of your red wine pass-outs.
Look, we appreciate your concern, Lois, but Scotty is our son, and we have to tend to him as we see fit.
Um, does your god also not believe in putting out snacks for the guests?
I don't know who's crazier-- these people or those Seventh-Day Adventists.
We believe that the Lord is our Savior, and we remember Him by going to church and praising Him every Sunday.
We believe all the same things that you believe, but we go to church on Saturdays.
I know it's frustrating, Lois, but the fact is, there are no laws that say those people have to take their child to the doctor.
You could file a suit, but that could take months, and even then, there's no guarantee the court wouldn't support the parents' right to practice their religion.
How could we live in a country that would allow a sick child to die?
Look, this country was founded by people who came here to escape religious persecution.
They made sure we all had a right to religious freedom, and it's my job to protect that.
What does that have to do with a sick child?
Look, it's a nice night out, you're eating at a fancy buffet, the captain does his Al Pacino...
Oh, yeah? Are the firemen gonna come and put out the rape?!
'Cause then we could just go in there and steal that kid.
Then I could dip my head in brown paint and galumph around Europe looking for my hot daughter.
Then we could just fly around on a dragon and forget about all this.
I'm talking about us going in there and taking that kid and getting him some help.
I mean, I know it's wrong, but it's better than just letting him die.
Like those idiots who get together to paint a school.
This underachieving, crime-ridden school is now fawn beige, thanks to guilty white people with no weekend plans!
It's kind of hard to breathe in those things, so I just dressed up like Harry Potter.
I want you to know, I haven't been happy for a long time.
Okay, now, take this walkie-talkie and confirm that I'm at the various checkpoints.
Come up and have sex with me some time. Van full of Peters who all have stern faces because they're about to pull off a heist?
Check. Upside-down Peter who isn't revealed to be upside-down until the camera spins around and shows that he is?
Check. Peter in an open airplane door slapping other Peters on the back as they parachute out?
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Check! Super gymnastic Asian Peter contorted into a box that will be delivered into the house?
Hai! Peter who hasn't answered because something has gone terribly wrong?
All right, you keep the car going in case there's trouble.
Oh. Well, you know, we ain't known this family that long.
Damn it, put him back and go get Scotty, the baby!
Okay, so I'll go get the baby, and while I'm doing that, maybe you do something about that snatchy tone.
Crime Show Where the Murderer is the Most Famous Person in the Credits.
I think you're gonna want to take a look at this.
A local kidnapping has rocked Quahog tonight. Rocked Quahog? Really?
But the whole-- All right, well, in any event, we now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.
Tom, I'm standing here with Mayor Adam West, with the latest information about the disappearance of young Scotty Jennings.
What is the city doing to help rescue the missing boy?
Well, we're looking for this child using all the latest technology, including the newest, most advanced multimedia milk cartons.
This was so funny in my head when I planned it.
We're gonna get you to the hospital and get you the medical attention you need.
When this is over, we can get some ice cream.
Me and Lois can get some ice cream, not you.
You know, Peter, you were right, this is actually kind of a rush.
I mean, look at us, we're like Thelma and Louise.
Yeah, but we all know that didn't end well for them.
And when we get out, we'll still have the rest of our lives ahead of us.
I am standing outside Quahog Hospital, where accused kidnappers Lois and Peter Griffin have just arrived.
Also arriving is my overprotective boyfriend, who is suspicious whenever I am called into work at night, even though I've been a reporter for years, Tyrone.
I thought I told you to mention my painting business.
I'm gonna have to ask you to hand over the baby and surrender.
I promise, when this is over, I'll gladly go to prison for the rest of my life, but not until I bring this defenseless child into the hospital to get him the treatment he deserves.
Uh, Joe, we would like two tickets to the Policeman's Ball.
Stop what you're doing and give Scotty back to us!
And maybe that's why he ended up in my hands.
I know you don't believe in modern medicine, but you do believe in the power of prayer.
And through the years, when there was disease or infection, people of good faith would pray to God for a cure.
Well, then isn't it possible that penicillin, vaccines and antibiotics are all actually answered prayers?
And isn't it possible that the amazing men and women of medicine who brought about these miracles could be the instruments of God's answers to our prayers?
Try to work a few laughs in there if you can.
And I know you want Scotty to live a full life.
And if that's true, then I think it's wrong for you to ignore what very well could be the Lord's will.
I mean, what's the point in praying to God if you're just going to wipe your butt with his answers?
Well, I guess through the Lord's will, anything is possible.
TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Dracula in San Francisco.
Well, I just got off the phone with Hope, and it sounds like Scotty's gonna make a full recovery.
Yeah, you know, I figured I'd give it a shot.
I mean, wouldn't it be cool if you could pray really hard for something, and it actually happened?
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, and the reason I'm wearing this mask is because we've got a Make-A-Wish kid in the studio tonight, who, as you'll find out as the show goes on, is quite a cougher.
Are we gonna get that, or are we gonna wait for commercial?
You know, Tom, I haven't seen you in a mask since you went under the stage name George P. Wilbur.
Oh-ho-ho, Joyce, you know we don't talk about that on the air.
Did she... did she just say that George P. Wilbur was Tom Tucker's stage name?
That's the guy who played Michael Myers in Halloween 4, the greatest movie of all time.
I have enormous psychological problems, and I'm going to take them out on you.
It is him. I can't believe it. was your favorite movie.
Yeah, she's really nice and super pretty, and her bicycle seat smells like strawberries.
I'm gonna go upstairs and alternate between hopeful excitement and suicidal pessimism!
I just found out that you were the guy who played Michael Myers in Halloween 4, and I just want to say,
I think that was the most brilliant performance ever in the history of everything, and I wanted to see if you would sign my DVD.
Well, I tried to make a career out there in Hollywood, but I just didn't realize how tough acting is.
You see, life after Halloween 4 wasn't exactly smooth sailing.
The work I did manage to get was usually just bit parts that didn't last too long.
Like the role of Denise's boyfriend on The Cosby Show.
So, if you guys are a family, why are none of you the same shade of black?
I was also coked out of my skull most of the time.
I left Hollywood, moved back to my hometown of Quahog, and wound up working here as a news anchor.
Every second of every day, but I can't touch coke again.
But it's over for me. That's all in the past.
Well, if you ask me, you got the makings of a star.
Well, that's a nice offer, but I'm not quite sure how you expect to do that.
Well, you've brought me so much joy over the years as that lovable murderer of teenagers, and I want to return the favor.
All you need is some fake hair and a bunch of Hobbits hanging around you.
Look, I appreciate your offer, but I've got a pretty good thing going here.
In a few minutes, I've got to be on camera in front of 800 people.
Our top story tonight: The Rhode Island Historical Society is heralding the arrival of a cast-iron, oak-handled
Colonial bedsheet warmer, now on display in the Statehouse Rotunda.
As I understand it, they would put the coal inside of that, and then put the object between the sheets.
Well, aren't you the Peter Griffin of Peter Griffin Cadillac?
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin, and at Peter Griffin Cadillac, we believe in three things: fair dealing, family, and friendship.
All right, Lois, remember to feed the cat, and remember to get a cat.
I still don't understand why you got to go all the way to Hollywood.
Because I know Tom Tucker could be a great actor, and I'm gonna help him make it happen.
You see, everybody needs just one person to believe in their dreams so they can spread their wings and fly.
But I'll be sure to be back before Chris's big dance class recital.
Boy, I don't know, Peter, being back out here makes me kind of nervous.
Don't be silly, Tom-- you're an actor, and this is where you belong. Now, let's take some of this complimentary luggage and get going.
You just sit back and let your agent knock on every door in Hollywood till he gets you an acting job.
All right, kid, you want to make it in showbiz or don't you?
Hey, Mom, I want you to meet my new girlfriend.
Well, I asked her out, and now we are dating.
Lindsey, this is my mom, my little brother Stewie, and my dog Brian.
I know, it's kind of creepy. It's almost like he's dating Lois. Yeah.
All the biggest Hollywood players eat here, and we just got to make them think we're one of them.
Yes, I will have the Big and Fancy, and my client here will have a bottle of your best steak.
Peter, I-I'm not sure what any of this has to do with getting me acting jobs.
Ah, then we best load our pockets with bread and get the hell out of here.
Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice your glasses, your poor table manners and your huge sense of entitlement.
Well, I'm the casting director for NCIS, and we need an actor for a mall role that shoots tomorrow.
You know, Lindsey, I just want to say how nice it is to have such a beautiful young woman in our home.
Eh, I'll think of something while I'm taking a chick dump in your parents' bathroom.
Lois, don't you think maybe part of the reason you like Lindsey could be because she looks so much like you?
And I think it's possible that your vanity has made you a little blind to that.
Chris has a wonderful young woman in his life, and you've got nothing.
All you've got is a worn-out rope toy and that squirrel who comes by once a day to taunt you.
I'm looking for a guy who used to work here.
You son of a bitch, you made me feel again.
You know, Peter, I just want to thank you for all you've done for me.
He says he wants to talk to you about being his agent.
Diane Simmons had just stabbed you in the back with a knife.
Yeah! How the hell did you come back to life?!
Well, gentlemen, sometimes being a big Hollywood star has its advantages.
Being a famous movie star entitled me to topnotch medical care not available to the rest of society.
My body was immediately taken to a Hollywood hospital, where I was hooked up to a 17-year-old ingenue.
And in accordance with Hollywood law, her life force was infused into me, bringing me back from the dead.
I threw her out a car window at Nora Ephron.
So, what do you say, Peter? Will you be my agent?
I don't get it. Why would a big shot like you want me for an agent?
But you put me and my family through a lot of crap over the years.
Peter, I need you to drop Stewie off at day care, and then shred this big stack of old bank statements.
So, Kevin made another attempt on his life last night.
You know, everyone said, Don't smoke during your pregnancy, but I think some of it rubbed off on him 'cause now he's cool.
Hey, you know, she kind of looks like you, Lois.
Maybe I have been blinded by my own stupid vanity.
I guess I'll have to, but he doesn't take bad news very well.
Oh, Chris, honey, I'm so sorry to tell you this, but your grandfather died.
Well, we're making a mediocre action film, and we think James is just the guy to do a serviceable job in a supporting role that Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum, and Craig T. Nelson have already passed on.
This is Peter Griffin, famous agent, but you can call me PG-13.
And you know, about that meeting you set up with me and Heath Ledger...
Maybe I was at the wrong Panda Express, but I...
I-I was starting to get nervous when you weren't returning my calls.
Tom, I... I didn't know how to say this to you, so, here, take this piece of paper.
And you're on in four, three, two... Peter Griffin drops Tom Tucker as a client.
Look, it's a whole different landscape out here since Thursday.
I wish I could help you, Tom, but this is coming from upstairs.
But if you're ever Kevin James, I want you to give me a call.
I just met this and I can't decide whether to take her home or keep doing blow with Tom Sizemore and see if I can do better later in the night.
So clear out of your apartment; we're gonna be there in 15.
Chris, honey, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Well, you got to admit, Mom, she does look a lot like you.
I mean, I just look at you and Dad, you know?
He's a complete train wreck, and you put up with him.
So, I guess I figured if I don't find a girl just like you,
You're a handsome, kind-hearted, young man, and any girl would be lucky to have you in her life.
Now I'm gonna take the child filter off the computer, and I want you to have a fun night.
Peter, you've pitched me dozens of projects, and all of them involve me playing a hayride driver.
You know, this year, it's vampires, next year, it's hay.
Peter, this is probably a good time to fire you.
I need a drugs guy, a girls guy, a fitness guy, a guy with a boat who can dump stuff way-out-there kind of guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to answer this fake phone call.
I dragged you out here, only to dump you when you needed me the most.
I quit my job, I left everything behind to come out here.
Well, I suppose your only crime is that you believed in me.
You ready to go back to where we both belong?
Tom, I think I speak for all of us here at Channel Five News when I say it's good to have you back here at half your original salary.
So head on down before the gays turn it into a cruising ground like they did the Barnes and Noble upstairs coffee bar, which they had to close.
What did Lindsey say when you broke up with her?
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker bringing you news you heard four hours ago on the Internet.
A ferry carrying a shipment of brand-new Mercedes Benzes from Germany crashed and sank just a few miles off our coast.
Thus far, the cars remain on the ocean floor as the Germans refuse to clean up the disaster.
The German Environmental Minister called a press conference to issue the following statement:
All them fancy cars out there in the ocean, just free for the taking?
Peter, that may be the stupidest idea you've ever had.
You know, a lot of us here at Family Guy are, frankly, sickened by the sorry state of education in this country and how little you people read anymore.
So, for this next cutaway, we're gonna make you read it.
Do a little work once in a while, instead of having everything spoon-fed.
Okay, that one might have been more of a visual, but you feel that feeling you got right now?
One was in a drawer all day. Wow, seems like Lois would've checked that stuff out before sending you.
You know, half the time you can hear someone showering.
I mean, you never see them, but you can hear the shower going.
Really? That seems weird. Yeah, and is it normal that Miss Emily tied us all to the sink while she went out to return a birthday present?
You know, Stewie, maybe I should come by tomorrow and check things out.
The world would be so much better if it were run by babies.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean, no?
Use sunscreen! Y-You don't need to put a circus on your head.
No, it's all right. We were just trying to get some of them sunken Mercedes.
Oh, yeah, there's a great big pile of them down there.
Me and my mates, right, we was having a laugh sitting in of one of them, pretending to be people.
You know, like, driving around getting into incidents with other motorists.
Uh, well, I'm Peter, and that's, uh, Joe, and that's Quagmire.
Say, you want me to try and get you one of those cars from down there, yeah?
So, uh, what do you have planned for the summer?
Sorry, mate, all I could get was this hood ornament.
Thank you so much! Hey, you know, if there's ever anything I could do for you...
Wait, is that the brand that costs five cents more?
Things ain't so good in America right now, which is why we're all so fat.
Oh, what happened to that kid? He fell off a stool trying to turn off Maury Povich.
Oh, yeah! I should probably go back in there, see how everyone's doing, I guess.
You remember how you said I'd never amount to nothing?
My God, who could be at the door at this hour?
I don't know, but this late, it's got to be bad news.
Everyone knows you always get bad news in the middle of the night.
Just wanted to take you up on your nice offer from earlier.
You know, the bit about If there's ever anything I can do, so, yeah... Oh.
Yeah, thought I might make a go of it on land.
It's that dolphin-- I think he wants to crash here.
Put it to your ear. You can hear the ocean.
So, Billy, I, uh, I hope the couch was all right?
And I should know, 'cause I went down on the floor, thinking it had to be a lot better than the couch.
Yeah. Well, it's just... would you mind tossing it up in the air for me?
So, Billy, how long will you be staying with us?
Only been here one night, but I get the sense we all dislike Meg.
Peter, I'm not so sure about Billy staying here with us.
Listen, just leave it to me. I'm great with animals.
Brian, what are you doing here? Came by to check on my pal.
Where's, uh, Miss Emily? I haven't seen her yet today.
She gave me the keys to open up when she left yesterday.
I thought you said you were gonna talk to her.
I thought you had a busy day at your legal practice.
Let me just put these bags away and throw some saltines in the yard for the kids.
Hey, I'm sorry, but Miss Emily and I have a connection, which is totally unexpected.
And by the way, I actually think she's doing a pretty good job.
Say you like it, or she's gonna spend the rest of the afternoon out returning that stuff.
Hey, do you think maybe you'd want to hang out sometime?
I had a bad experience last time I went to the movies.
Isn't that that horrible documentary where they kill all the fish?
Well, yeah, but this one was in the video store under Ethan's Picks.
I know you can't tell this, but the one who's about to get her throat cut, she's sorta hot.
I can't just do it on the floor, can I?
You'd be all, like, Ooh, who left this coil of rope on the floor?
And, again, I'm gonna ask one more question, and don't take this the wrong way, but have you actually got a penis?
So then I'm reading the funnies, and right before I get to the last panel,
Billy blurts out, he goes, he goes, You know, those firemen showed up to get a cat out of the tree, but it turns out it's really Marmaduke up there.
Peter, in Billy's defense, the strip is called Marmaduke, and Marmaduke had not yet made an appearance.
I tell ya, he was fun at first, but now I'm not sure I can take much more of him living here.
Well, Peter, you've more than paid back your debt to him.
If you ask me, it's time for him to go.
Plus, the sooner we get him out of here, the sooner I can get back to my cocaine and dollhouses.
I finally stood up for all of us and told Miss Emily we should be given a proper lunch and not just what's left over from her Baja Fresh.
And she said I shouldn't raise my voice and pulled me really hard into the other room, and my arm came out of its socket.
Are you sure you didn't just sleep on it funny?
I finally have a date with Miss Emily tomorrow, and I'm not gonna let you or anybody else get in my way until I have seen every inch of her naked.
And what am I supposed to do about my arm?!
Hey, uh, listen, Billy, it's been fun having you stay here, but we really need to talk about making some new arrangements.
Is this because there's some kind of problem with the hood ornament?
'cause it dawned on me that the only thing better than you having one of them would be you having two of them.
Yeah, be quite a thing for you to have two of them, wouldn't it?
Now, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?
Peter, I'm standing here on your front porch, hoping to kill that dolphin with this harpoon.
So the thing about dolphin lullabies is that they're all in the key of eee-eee! Eee!
Peter, believe me, if she'd take me back, I'd go in a second.
But she won't, so as much as I love her, moot point.
Yeah, and P.S., that guy doesn't throw darts much. He's new.
Peter, I thought you said you were gonna ask Billy to leave.
I know, Lois, but I found out he's only here 'cause his wife kicked him out.
So I figured out a way to kill two birds with one stone.
The key to that, Lois, is big rock, small birds.
Oh, and I also figured out how to achieve two goals with one action.
See, I'm gonna help Billy get back together with his wife, and then he'll move out and stop annoying us.
A piece of wood with a, with a nail in it. Neat.
There was a kitchen explosion today, and half the kids are deaf.
There is a special place in hell for people like you.
Man, when she gets to jail, she's gonna be major lez-chow.
Hey, I brought this sack of garbage from my home.
He's here because he loves you, and he wants to patch things up.
Look, Billy, I don't care what you or your fat friend here has to say, it's over.
It was just a dumb plan my buddies and I put together because we know how much Billy loves you.
And if you won't do it for me, do it for Fish Jesus.
He was nailed to a board and hung in a man's study as a novelty to sing funny songs.
Your god is a gag gift, did you know that?
You know what? I had to live on the land to learn there might be a million fish in the sea, but there's only one you.
Hey, Brian, thanks for helping get rid of Miss Emily.
Although I've got to say, my new preschool teacher is even hotter.
Okay, now just stay like this and let Peter and Lois finish their thing.
Wow, Peter, you did a really nice thing helping Billy get back together with his wife.
Yeah, and the best part is, he's out of the house and back in the ocean.
Oh, my God, Brian, I went to a baby rave last night.
Like, when I came home, The Mentalist was still on.
I'll be out in the yard using my new riding mower.
A riding mower? For God's sakes, stop making all these frivolous purchases.
You just blew all that money hiring that English- to-raccoon translator.
Tell him to come back when he's ready to act like an adult.
I thought they all disappeared, because all I could hear was a lawnmower.
I can't. He's in Vegas for the weekend, seeing that handicapped Cher impersonator.
I can't remember what the hell I did with it.
Oh, my God, a piece of your brain came out!
When I found him, he was just walking face-first into a chain-link fence downtown.
Well, by the laws of comedy, you and I have to be roommates now.
Now, I'm going to prescribe a course of antibiotics and some painkillers and...
Okay, Quagmire, before we get your prescription, let's grab some bandages.
How are we gonna find gauze and bandages in the middle of all this crap?
Uh, I think he keeps them next to the thousand-piece puzzle of a lobster trap.
I don't see it. You mean, next to the Kadima paddles, or next to the basic black sweatshirt with no writing on it?
No, I think they're over there between the rain ponchos and the cap guns and just below the balsa wood gliders and the net-bag of flip-flops and a beach pail.
Yes, above the jacks and the bicentennial playing cards and across from the giant cage with the beach balls, next to the Wiffle ball bats and the spark-spitting cars.
I don't... Oh, next to the wax bottles of weird juice.
Yes, behind the plastic bag of Mexican soldiers from the Alamo and the Super Elastic Bubble Plastic.
If this is it, ooh, wah, please let me know
But I thought you made a lot of money here.
I used to, but it's all gone downhill since Muriel died.
She could get away with overcharging people, because they were always mentally undressing her and then re-dressing her once they saw the horrible mess underneath.
Well, look, uh, I don't know, maybe there's something we can do to help you drum up some business.
Is opening and closing the cash register a bunch of times helping business yet?
Okay, Mort, now, if you want to get more customers in your pharmacy, you're gonna have to do a promotion, like... like buy one, get one free.
Oh, 'cause it seems like you're saying the first part in English and then some kind of made-up pha-lumpf-phalumpf or something in the second part.
Let's say we're at someone else's store, and there's a sign, and it says: Buy one, get one free.
Excuse me, I have been waiting for my prescription for 25 minutes!
Remember, each pill has to go into the correct bottle.
We fly this thing over Providence, it's bound to get people into the pharmacy.
That's right, bring in the city folk with their big money and their long cigarettes and their dogs with shoes.
Hey, check it out-- we got a giggity over there on the 32nd floor.
Now, that could be a good place to get new shoes for my dog.
Grim details continue to roll in at this hour in the story of the detached airplane advertising banner which caused a school bus to plummet into the Pawtuxet River.
Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy made headlines across the country after a banner of theirs caused the bus to drive off a bridge, tragically killing all the teenagers on board.
Many of the students tweeted about the accident as it was happening.
Here's @TheTed69: I'm gonna survive this. LOL jk. Jk, indeed.
I wish there was some way we could fix it.
You know, my cousin had the same problem, but he lucked out, 'cause his business burned to the ground.
Last year, after I lost my beloved Muriel, our life insurance company refused to pay on her policy.
They took what should have been a pleasant experience and made it into an ordeal!
A friend of mine staying in my house got, um, injured, and my homeowner's insurance wouldn't pay her doctor bills.
Yeah, come to think of it, they wouldn't even pay for the fetus Lois lost when we went to visit the Museum of Staircases and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.
Yeah, you know, they don't seem to pay out on anything.
No, not at all, right? Yeah, that's true, they don't pay.
This is not smuggling Oriental women into the country in steel cans.
And, look, as long as nobody sees us, and we don't tell anybody, then we're in the clear.
Well, I guess I did kind of destroy your business, Mort.
Good. I'm just gonna have to reschedule my weekly re-circumcision.
So, what are we doing today, a little off the top?
Yeah, but leave a little up front so I have something to play with. Sounds good.
Yeah, let's trim that. I don't know when that started, but let's get rid of that.
If we put it on the electric box and two of the outlets, then light them all at once, it'll look like a short circuit.
Geez, Mort, how the hell do you know how to do all this?
Right after the chapter on writing complaint letters that will result in compensatory merchandise.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Just as a box of crackers is only as appealing as its least intact sleeve.
I am paying for fully formed crackers, not butter crumbles.
I don't buy your product with broken quarters; don't stick me with broken pieces of cracker, you miserable dicks!
Hey, Peter, what are you gonna tell Lois when she asks where you were tonight?
It looks like it was just a case of faulty wiring.
Okay, well... I'm sorry for your loss, but the good news is your insurance will be covering all of your damages.
You hear what he said, fellas? Looks like we pulled it off.
We were all seeing The Beatles live at The Ed Sullivan Show.
All right, guys, all we got to do now is keep a low profile and not mention a word of this to anybody.
Hey, Mort, I, uh, was really sorry to hear about the pharmacy.
His shirt was tucked in, so I bet he went to Harvard.
I want you to know that I'm going to personally go over all the evidence.
I'd hate to think there's someone in town who's out to get you.
Roll away. No, I'm just saying, as your friend, I wouldn't feel right unless I left no stone unturned.
Yeah, Joe, even Robocop took a day off once in a while.
I looked in the mirror this morning, and it was like
I was looking at a man I'd never seen before.
Oh, hey, I forgot, I brought you guys souvenirs from my trip to Vegas.
They're T-shirts that say I lost my shirt in Lost Wages.
I got to go see the forensics team about the pharmacy.
This is the right way to deal with your problems.
I think I know how to get him off the case once and for all.
I was looking forward to giving you your birthday present next week.
Guys, I got to become chief of police by next week.
Chief, this just came in for you from Officer Swanson.
Hmm. These burn ignition patterns aren't consistent with an electrical fire. Would... love to. Probably... about 7:00... or 7:30. Any... of... those places would be... fine.
God! No way! I don't know Probably just a collared shirt and jeans. Have you never been to... a restaurant before?
He sure is. Okay, now tell him you want a vegan place.
I'm gonna send it to voicemail, then call him back, but pocket-dial him while I walk a few blocks.
I've been giving it a lot of thought, and I think we all just need to confess.
If you start yapping to the cops, we're gonna rot in prison for the next 30 years.
Did any of you happen to be at Mort's pharmacy on the night of the fire?
I see. Well, then it's kind of peculiar that I would find this.
A pocket-dial voicemail from Peter on the night of the fire.
Oh, my God, look at that fire we started, Quagmire and Mort.
That's a piece of evidence that hurts all of us.
You three are under arrest for burning down Goldman's Pharmacy.
I would, but I don't want my gym teacher to laugh at me.
First, I have to read you the Miranda rights for Jewish people.
You have the right to remain silent, even though you won't.
You have the right to infer an insult where none was intended.
You have the right to a lawyer, who you are probably related to.
What were you dointhe night of March 8th? your mother.
It's gonna take a lot more than a fart in my face to make me...
Boy, that Ashton Kutcher sure was a cad in that movie, wasn't he?
Is it true? Did you really burn down Mort's pharmacy?
Peter, how could you do this? You have a family.
Did you ever stop to think about us before you did something that could send you away to prison?
For once, could you visit me in jail and not criticize me?
You know you guys are gonna do time for this.
You know how hard it's gonna be for me to make new friends?
Hey, do you think Chris is old enough to be my friend?
Old enough? Yes. But I wouldn't bark down that alley.
Well, insurance fraud is not the way to help somebody out.
You don't know what it's like to be screwed over by an insurance company.
I was barely conscious on the operating table, but I'll never forget the phone call that changed my life.
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of your policyholder, Joe Swanson.
Well, there's a new procedure that, if administered immediately, should restore his ability to walk.
The thing is, you guys committed a crime, and I've still got the evidence to prove it.
Peter, I don't understand how they just let you out of jail.
Yeah, Joe had all kinds of evidence against you guys.
I thought if you do something wrong, you're supposed to get punished.
Well, now that I've wrapped things up with you guys,
In a shocking turn of events, the city of Detroit has officially given up.
The now former mayor has given the key to the city back to the Huron Indian tribe.
From Bob Seger to Axel Foley, we never really cared. Joyce?
Quahog is expecting a special guest this weekend, famed Asian competitive eating champion
Yamamoto has not yet lost a hot dog eating competition on his world tour.
But if you think you have what it takes to beat the best eater in the world, come down to the James Woods High parking lot this Saturday with $50 and a large appetite.
Well, I would, Chris, if I wasn't so obsessed with my figure.
Damn it, I knew I shouldn't have named that star for Mort.
Peter, we're not spending $50 so Chris can stuff his face with hot dogs.
I'll figure out a way to get the cash myself.
All right, Chris, if we're gonna pay the entry fee for that eating contest, we got to sell some of my old stuff.
Yeah, well, I was one cool potato back in the day.
You know, some of these might actually be worth something.
Oh, my God, I haven't seen this one in forever.
Now for the next five days, we're gonna focus on nothing but training.
Just... get-get... get in... get in the bed with me and your mom.
Please tell me you set the timer on the coffeemaker because I completely forgot.
Hey, can I get a couple of scratch-off lottery tickets?
I'll tell you what the news of the world is.
If you get nervous, just picture the audience naked and slide those hot dogs down your throat.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the World Hot Dog Eating Championship Competition!
I get these weird cyst things right on the fringe of my sac.
I want to get 'em checked, but I'm afraid of what they're gonna tell me.
Damn it, don't you see what you did to him?
I told you not to take him to that eating competition, and you deliberately defied me!
So I decided to sign him up for fat camp.
What?! Mom, I don't want to go to fat camp!
And I'd better not see you at the big dance!
Well, you're the one who entered him in that hot dog eating contest.
Oh, there's no pulling the wool over this guy's eyes.
I think I'm gonna do okay here at fat camp.
And then he went into the kitchen, slowly opened the refrigerator, and it was empty!
So then, the man, weak with hunger, raced from the refrigerator to the counter to look for a delivery menu, but all he could find was one for a vegan place!
And I think getting a new couch was the way to go.
Is there someone else who has a story they'd like to share? Peter?
This one time, I was on a city bus, and the guy next to me was eating a bucket of fried chicken.
I just dug in and started stuffing that chicken into my mouth.
Rupert, we won't give that evil robot the satisfaction of killing us.
He killed Queen, and now he's going to kill me!
Well... I'm usually more comfortable around things if I can put them in my mouth.
Good thing there wasn't land or else you'd have to meet the natives with that mustard stain on your shirt. What stain?
Ugh! Why did I even bring you on this trip?!
Because I'm the best damn land spotter in all of Europe.
I saw a forest like this in a book one time, and I know there's a gingerbread house out here somewhere.
We have to, Chris. We-we gotta eat something besides what they're feeding us.
Well, we clearly don't have all the evidence yet, but that's never stopped us before, right?
But we do know one thing, this kid was murdered.
Murdered?! Who in the world would want to kill a camper?
And it looks like there are signs of trauma around the throat.
Well, there's only one person I know who likes to strangle fat guys:
I guess he fits the profile, Peter, but Lois's brother is locked up in an asylum.
Hey, we all know this guy goes for the classy ladies.
In fact, I once caught him trying to pick up a quack whore.
I was Anita in the camp production of West Side Story.
Wait a second, Lois, I want to go back to what you said about my patter singing.
You know I carried Pirates of Penzance that season at Quahog Community Theater.
Man, I hope we get back to your house before Patrick hurts anyone else!
I'll do to him what I did to the Riddler.
Patrick Pewterschmidt, you're under arrest for the murder of, uh... (bleep)
Patrick, you're my brother and I love you, but you're not well.
Just this morning, a very nice gentleman opened my cell door and said I was free to go.
Like those anal-retentive bandits who robbed Quahog Bank last year.
But first fix that notepad so it's at a right angle with the corner of your desk!
And tap that pile of receipts against a flat surface so they're not sticking out haphazardly!
All right, campers, until the Fat Guy Strangler is caught, everyone has to stay inside their cabins.
Well, I'd better put out an APB to all the neighboring towns.
He's got plenty of places to hide out there and a fully stocked corral of victims.
You know, Joe, maybe Patrick can actually be of help.
I mean, who better to get inside the mind of someone who's strangling fat people than someone who's done it himself?
I used to be afraid of 'em, until I realized they were just misunderstood.
I could give you my wallet, but what I think you really want... is love.
You know, the weirdest thing is his bunk is right next to Chris's.
You said the first victim was wearing a baseball cap, this second one is blond...
I don't know, but I do know that he's in a great deal of danger right now.
But wait, this is our last chance to do a panty raid!
No one has ever eaten more hot dogs than me.
Wait a minute, Joe. That's the guy who opened the door to my cell yesterday and told me
Yamamoto wanted it to look like you broke out on your own.
That way, when he murdered Chris, it was a cinch that you would take the blame.
Well, Patrick, I guess we all owe you an apology.
I don't know, but I'd better make it look like there was a struggle.
Me and Brian are going to play laser tag with Joe and Quagmire.
Last time they hung out without me was a disaster.
What, I thought we were watching La Vie En Rose.
Everything goes wrong on the one day it has to go right.
But La Vie En Rose is a beautiful movie about the real life tragedy of Edith Piaf.
Because you were supposed to be watching him, but you were smoking marijuana and he drowned!
I don't know! I just can't stand it when he's not here!
Peter, you've got every other night of the week to spend with your buddies.
This is the one night we've set aside for our family.
I wanna show you a freckle on my sack that I'm concerned about.
Oh, would you shut up? All the good people are gone.
Please pay attention while I show y'all how to put on y'all's vests.
Thank you, I have longed for your attention since the moment I arrived.
Now, I'm gonna need you to squats down like your underwears is done for, but you might still save the jeans.
Now, you's gonna wanna latch the front to the back like so...
Boy, a lot of heat comes off you, don't it?
Yeah, and he seems to be weirdly physically fit at this place.
Yeah, it's almost like he has unrealistic abilities when we play laser tag.
Well, for five dollars, you could get your picture in a fake newspaper with a humorous headline.
She's taking care of that kitten like it's her own.
Yep, I knew eventually she'd stop tearin' 'em in half.
Look, Lois, I know you're mad, but I think this will prove that I did the right thing.
No longer will we be just those faceless nobodies who brought the bird flu to Quahog.
You know, there's something seriously wrong with a man who always puts his friends over his family.
What's so wrong about a guy hanging out with his buddies?
'Cause I don't try to tell him what he can and can't do.
You're just two people who live in the same house.
If you didn't, you'd never hang out with each other in a million years.
He used to hang you in the garage so his fender wouldn't hit the wall.
Like those girls who insist their best friends are attractive.
Oh, Stewie, I can't wait for you to meet my best friend.
Oh, my God, yeah. People ask her if she's a model all the time.
Okay, okay, that was an extreme example, but face it, ladies, your best friends are not hot.
Uh, Peter, your seat belt back here doesn't work right.
You two seem to be the only ones in this hospital.
All I know is, I'm extremely important because there are drawings of me on all the bathroom doors.
It's glued on there, too, so I'm pretty sure it's permanent.
We seem perfectly coherent, it's just we can't remember who we are.
Well, we could still be a band and choose a different name.
I'm gonna open up this bag of Chex Party Mix.
All right, look, we know we woke up in the hospital, so maybe there was some kind of catastrophe that we were all spared.
Or maybe we were all in some kind of accident.
You must have gotten hurt worse than the rest of us.
Yeah, I got hit so hard, it knocked my pee into a bag.
Hey, you know, if we're all gonna be tryin' to figure this out together, maybe it would be easier if we gave each other names.
All I know for sure is I'm wearing a shirt and pants.
It just doesn't make sense that there aren't any people.
Well, when I find that person, I'm gonna strangle him.
I had a life, and he took it away from me.
I don't remember it, but I bet it was pretty good.
I bet I was a doctor who had to deal with a lot of serious stuff, but always found a way to keep things light.
Yeah, and I bet I answered the customer complaint line at a Danish cookie company.
I mean, t-they came in a tin, how fresh did you think they were gonna be?
Well, I bet I did something really important and exciting.
Like-like maybe I was a speechwriter for the first ever black president.
Yea, and I bet you I was the voice of an animated bird.
This must be the accident that put us all in the hospital.
See if there's a registration in the glove compartment. Peter Griffin.
I just hope it doesn't have one of those mailboxes that looks like a cow.
I just want to seem cool to these guys, but I really hope
I have one of those mailboxes that looks like a cow. Moo, says my mailbox.
I'm gonna go shove my hand down my pants and see if that goes someplace.
Yeah, I mean, there's no pictures of me, but I see you've got a dog collar and a leash.
Then just do it, stop talking about it for God's sake.
Turns out my name is Glenn Quagmire, and this is my dog.
Turns out my name's Joe Swanson, and I found this police uniform in my closet.
Well, it's good we found out who we all are, but we still haven't found out what the hell happened to everybody else.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that, and I think the best course of action is for us to just go ahead and start repopulating the Earth.
There's a bedroom upstairs that belonged to some girl, and she's got bras in there, and the cups are different sizes.
L-Like one of them's a martini glass and the other one's some kinda melon.
Guys, you know how we were thinking that something must have caused this situation... or someone? Yeah?
But how could a guy like that cause all this destruction?
He's some kind of omnipotent alien, with powers we can only guess at.
I mean, I do have all these profound ideas and thoughts.
I spent the whole morning trying to teach you one simple thing.
You're gonna make me look bad in front of the other guys.
You know, this actually reminds me of a quote by Milton...
The pie we're all gonna make for you for... being such a great guy.
I would kill everyone in the world and leave three survivors for a piece of pie right now.
We gotta find a way to kill him before he kills us.
How about we just get the hell out of here?
If this guy's an alien, I bet he can fly.
He's probably got a laser beam that can shoot us through the walls.
I just took a bunch of random stuff I found in my medicine cabinet, and you're really freaking me out right now.
But listen, if we're gonna kill him, we gotta find some guns.
Not all of us. Somebody's gotta go over there and keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.
I thought it was a dog whistle, but now I'm thinking it's something you jam in your urethra to make you last longer.
Man, I wonder if I'm one of those secret assassins who doesn't even know it, but I'm a highly trained killing machine.
If you repel my attack, maybe that means you're a secret assassin.
Hey, I know we're the only people on Earth and all, but what's with all these Mexicans coming here to steal our jobs?
Mine's even got a secret compartment in it where you can store stuff.
You know, you ever think if we could all just spend more time celebrating our similarities instead of just standing on our differences, the universe would be a much better place?
Not really. But that bum thing, you're-you're on to something there.
Y-You're, uh... you're some kind of deep thinker, aren't you?
We were just watching TV, but listen, you've got to believe me, he's not capable of hurting anyone.
Clearly he's controlling your mind with his superior alien brain.
Look, there's pretty solid evidence that this guy is responsible for the elimination of the entire human race, and we need to take him out.
But he trusts me, so you guys wait here, and I'll go lure him out.
I have a lot of dirty stuff in my house.
Yes, and you have to get out of here right away!
When you've been a stripper as long as I have, you know when you've met a bad egg.
Remember our little argument about whether you and Peter were actually friends?
Well, I wanted to prove to you that I was right, that your friendship was purely a result of circumstance.
So I created a scenario in which everyone's memories were erased, to demonstrate that you and Peter would never naturally associate with one another.
It appears you two have a genuine bond after all.
Oh, I wanted to see how three women would react in the same situation.
Come on, Stewie. Hurry up. I want to get good seats.
Ugh, I hate going to hear authors read from their work.
And when the drugs stopped numbing the pain, the sex became even more violent.
Yeah, yeah, of all my writing students, he's probably done the best.
Like most real authors, he's too good for this dumb town.
Oh, well, you know, I guess I should be getting back to my dorm anyway.
I've got a short story due for my creative writing class tomorrow.
Well, if you'd like me to look it over before you turn it in,
Is this what your parents are paying all that tuition for-- so you can  dogs?
I'll print up for you what I have so far.
Who's handling their Charlie St. Cloud DVD all the time?
Do you think Lois would be okay if I ate a Pop-Tart in bed?
Well, Mrs. Griffin, you have three crushed ribs, but I was able to stop the internal bleeding.
Doctor, this has happened seven times in the last month.
Peter rolls over in his sleep and almost kills me.
Well, it looks like you got a handle on it then.
And if he's not smothering me, he's keeping me up all night writing with that giant plume of his. Dearest Augustine, I do hope this latest damp has not aggravated your gray lung.
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. Matters stateside have taken a tragic turn as this year's gourd crop has fallen prey to a rather unexpected infestation of saltmarsh cutworms.
Look, how about if I take you to the park, huh?
Um, excuse me. I didn't bring any of my toys.
I'm new to town and I don't have many friends.
Would you like to play with some of my toys, Stewie?
I have a set of jacks, a paddleball, and this taffy with superglue.
Uh, Lois, why do we have Lucy and Ricky beds?
Because I'm sick of you crushing me in the middle of the night.
Lois, if God wanted me to not sleep with my wife, he would have made me John Travolta.
Believe it or not, men like to cuddle, even cold, unfeeling men like Charles Bronson.
Yes, at the end the brother pops up and turns you in.
My word, Penelope, you and I seem to have quite a lot in common.
I bought that to kill the women from Sex and the City, but time seems to be doing it for me.
Oh, do you have one of those white wine zombie moms?
She was taking a tub and somebody came in and cut her head off.
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming about doing that for years, and you've actually gone ahead and done it.
I've never said this to anyone before, but I feel like I may have finally found, in you, my one true soul mate.
It's as if our meeting were more than a mere coincidence.
This must be how Maverick felt when he met Goose.
E-Ever since Lois got us twin beds, I can't fall asleep.
I know. I always sleep better when I'm next to someone.
'cause, you know, I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I... want to propose an arrangement that could benefit the both of us.
Men need someone to spoon with and snuggle with just the same as women, and when you don't have that, it-it's...
I would like for you to sleep with me in my bed, and this, this is not about sex; it's about sleep.
Right, I mean, who says that the body next to you has to be male or female or... whatever?
Look, I, I think it's a great idea and I, I'm completely with you.
I know, 'cause they're supposed to be reserved for parties of three or more.
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice to finally have someone to do naughty things with.
All right, I made a wallet bomb and I planted it on Mort.
How do you go two weeks without opening your wallet?
I know, which is why I just planted another bomb that's set to go off every time he burps into his hand.
We blew up the Great Wall of China, bombed the Eiffel Tower, a look at this note I sent off. Dear Pakistan, Up yours.
Okay, I have to destroy Copenhagen with a... tidal wave, and the theme is... the Roaring Twenties.
Look, Lois, I told you that I need to have somebody sleeping next to me.
All right, now if that's not going to be you...
Okay, I just need to put this arm right around here.
Our top story: Authorities are still searching for the culprits in a series of horrific acts of destruction all across-- scroll down, guys-- the globe.
There was a long space at the end of that line.
It's you and Penelope who've been doing all of these horrible things.
What the hell did you think I was talking about when I said, Victory shall be mine?
You have not said that in a very long time.
Look, in the past you've done terrible things, but it's always been about the pursuit of your greater goal of world domination.
But this girl-- she just creates chaos for the sake of chaos.
I'm saying she's a bad influence on you, and you should stop spending time with her.
I thought we could burn her in her bed while her children watch.
You know, Penelope, maybe we don't have to kill someone every day.
I-I think Brian just got in my head a bit. That's all.
He just thinks that you're a bad influence on me.
Then swear on that love that you'll do what I ask.
Family Guy is brought to you by AXE Body Spray.
AXE Body Spray: Spray it on after gym class instead of getting beat up in the shower.
Kind of weird those guys want to fight you naked, huh?
Well, I wonder what words are gonna come out of this pen today.
I don't care how many children you've lost in childbirth.
But I was only having a child because you and the mister...
You don't get to speak of me and the mister!
Perhaps it was wrong of me to ask you to do such a thing.
I was actually dreading having to tell you about this.
I kill people and burp and watch so much porn.
I like a lot of goofball comedies that other chicks don't like.
Look, Peter, if you come home now, we can get our old bed back, and you can snuge with me as much as you want.
Well, then, hey... what do you say we go home, huh?
Hey, that mug was my crew gift from Class Holes.
Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
So then she said she was gonna kill you and...
Perhaps if I detonate an electromagnetic pulse, it will disable it.
Come on, Stewie. Hurry up. I want to get good seats.
Ugh, I hate going to hear authors read from their work.
And when the drugs stopped numbing the pain, the sex became even more violent.
Yeah, yeah, of all my writing students, he's probably done the best.

Believe it or not, men like to cuddle, even cold, unfeeling men like Charles Bronson.
Yes, at the end the brother pops up and turns you in.
My word, Penelope, you and I seem to have quite a lot in common.
I bought that to kill the women from Sex and the City, but time seems to be doing it for me.
Oh, do you have one of those white wine zombie moms?
She was taking a tub and somebody came in and cut her head off.
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming about doing that for years, and you've actually gone ahead and done it.
I've never said this to anyone before, but I feel like I may have finally found, in you, my one true soul mate.
It's as if our meeting were more than a mere coincidence.
This must be how Maverick felt when he met Goose.
E-Ever since Lois got us twin beds, I can't fall asleep.
I know. I always sleep better when I'm next to someone.
'cause, you know, I guess what I'm trying to say is,
I... want to propose an arrangement that could benefit the both of us.
Men need someone to spoon with and snuggle with just the same as women, and when you don't have that, it-it's...
I would like for you to sleep with me in my bed, and this, this is not about sex; it's about sleep.
Right, I mean, who says that the body next to you has to be male or female or... whatever?
Look, I, I think it's a great idea and I, I'm completely with you.
I know, 'cause they're supposed to be reserved for parties of three or more.
Oh, Stewie, it's so nice to finally have someone to do naughty things with.
All right, I made a wallet bomb and I planted it on Mort.
How do you go two weeks without opening your wallet?
I know, which is why I just planted another bomb that's set to go off every time he burps into his hand.
We blew up the Great Wall of China, bombed the Eiffel Tower, a look at this note I sent off. Dear Pakistan, Up yours.
Okay, I have to destroy Copenhagen with a... tidal wave, and the theme is... the Roaring Twenties.
Look, Lois, I told you that I need to have somebody sleeping next to me.
All right, now if that's not going to be you...
Okay, I just need to put this arm right around here.
Our top story: Authorities are still searching for the culprits in a series of horrific acts of destruction all across-- scroll down, guys-- the globe.
There was a long space at the end of that line.
It's you and Penelope who've been doing all of these horrible things.
What the hell did you think I was talking about when I said, Victory shall be mine?
You have not said that in a very long time.
Look, in the past you've done terrible things, but it's always been about the pursuit of your greater goal of world domination.
But this girl-- she just creates chaos for the sake of chaos.
I'm saying she's a bad influence on you, and you should stop spending time with her.
I thought we could burn her in her bed while her children watch.
You know, Penelope, maybe we don't have to kill someone every day.
I-I think Brian just got in my head a bit. That's all.
He just thinks that you're a bad influence on me.
Then swear on that love that you'll do what I ask.
Family Guy is brought to you by AXE Body Spray.
AXE Body Spray: Spray it on after gym class instead of getting beat up in the shower.
Kind of weird those guys want to fight you naked, huh?
Well, I wonder what words are gonna come out of this pen today.
I don't care how many children you've lost in childbirth.
But I was only having a child because you and the mister...
You don't get to speak of me and the mister!
Perhaps it was wrong of me to ask you to do such a thing.
I was actually dreading having to tell you about this.
I kill people and burp and watch so much porn.
I like a lot of goofball comedies that other chicks don't like.
Look, Peter, if you come home now, we can get our old bed back, and you can snuge with me as much as you want.
Well, then, hey... what do you say we go home, huh?
Hey, that mug was my crew gift from Class Holes.
Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
So then she said she was gonna kill you and...
Perhaps if I detonate an electromagnetic pulse, it will disable it.
You know, I don't think I can take another semester at this school, Ruth.
It's worse than sitting next to a baby on an airplane.
And right now, the game is very good to me.
If you hate it so much here, why don't you come to Paris for a semester with me instead?
My aunt even has an apartment there that we can stay in for free.
Excuse me, I was wondering if you would go to the dance with me on Friday.
Can I go to school in Paris for a semester?
Hey, you know, I have a pen pal in Paris.
Meg, I'd love to send you to Paris for a semester, but we can't afford that.
You know, sometimes I do part-time jobs for extra cash.
You be careful, sweetie, and call us as soon as the plane lands.
And I'm gonna bring you back something special, little guy.
Say hello to the Pont Neuf for me, or as I like to call it, my inspiration point...
Oh, and please do not be suspicious that I am at the airport with no baggage whatsoever.
A cool name to say with a French accent is Ashtahn Kootchere.
On a scale from un to dix, they're about a trois.
Hey, you wanna dance around like morons to loud music?
The apartment we're staying in is huge, Uh-huh. and has an incredible view of... Uh-huh.
I need you to listen to me very carefully: panic.
Then hide under the bed, but leave two of your feet sticking out.
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want.
I will never be able to find you, but what I do have is two dollars and a Casio wristwatch.
Ma'am, the men who took your daughter are most likely members of a sophisticated network of human smugglers.
If she's not found within 96 hours, chances are she's gone forever.
Sorry, we can't begin our search until she's been missing for 96 hours.
Stewie, I think there's only one way we're ever gonna see Meg again.
You and I have to take matters into our own hands.
Look, you're the only one who's got the know-how and the technology to help us track her down.
All right, I've booked us on a flight that leaves in two hours, so, um, whose credit card shall we put it on?
Just put it on yours and I'll pay you back.
I'll-I'll put it on my card, but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift because that's the only way I can do this anymore.
All right, the first thing we've got to do when we land is check the apartment where Meg was abducted and see if we can find some clues.
Excuse me, do you mind if we switch seats so my family can sit all together?
Ma'am, ma'am, your poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me.
God, Meg's kidnappers could be anywhere in France by now.
I recorded the kidnapper's phone call with the fat man.
You see, Brian, I record all phone calls coming in or out of the house.
Um... a guy doing chicks on a boat in a, uh, captain's hat.
The, um... the, passengers had, uh, just signed up for a tour of the harbor and then all that stuff happened.
Oh. I thought Paris would be a bit more picturesque.
Instead it's just traffic and some big guy using a jackhammer.
You know, maybe it'd help if we just tried to track Meg's movements from the moment she arrived in France.
Wow, I never knew you could do this on a computer.
'Course not, you spend all your time on this watching Captain Stabbin'.
He could be some sort of lookout who spots girls fresh off the plane.
I'll bet they target young girls the way Army commercials target minorities.
Look, we need to know: have you seen this girl?
Damn it. He died before he could tell us anything.
All right, this is the address that was in his wallet.
Yeah, but how are we gonna know for sure if these are the guys who took Meg?
I can use the voice recognition software in this recorder to confirm a match.
We ask them what they want, and when they say Drakkar Noir-- which they all will-- we'll know if we have our man.
All right, well, that's not him, but this is gonna be easy.
Well, gentlemen, now that you have smelled all of our colognes, what'll it be?
I am disgusting, so I will take two bottle Drakkar Noir.
I hope you burn in hell along with the guy who came up with stuffing a turkey.
No, uh, they took her just a little while ago.
Every Wednesday night, they auction some of the girls off.
What a weird night to auction girls off into slavery.
Well, you know, on the weekend, people probably have plans.
What are you doing that's more important than buying somebody?
I don't know, but there is a courtesy shuttle that runs every 20 minutes.
Well, I don't know 'bout you, but I'm gonna work out.
You just fit it in when you have free time, wherever you are, wherever you can.
There is cash back when you use your Visa Gold.
All right, fellas, bring the lights up a bit, play the CD I gave you and let's do this!
Going once, going twice, sold... to the man who doesn't quite get auctions.
Can we work it out, uh, maybe, some... other way?
This next girl is perfect for those of you who want to buy a sex slave but don't want to spend sex-slave money.
I heard that from Samantha in Sex and the City 2.
I always tell them, Put the prisoners in the jail cell, but they always say, Just chain 'em up to a pipe.
We were like Lewis and Clark and the guy who likes to tip over canoes.
Until now, walking to the other end of the United States seemed like such a good job.
All we have to do is cut diagonally across any nearby field.
All right, we just gotta catch up to the boat.
I bought you for my son, and not to be his slave, but to be his wife.
This is Faisal, my son and the heir to my throne.
Fair goddess, it is my hope that you will agree to be my wife, but the choice is yours.
I will have you flown back to your family on our private jet.
I will spend the rest of my days making your every wish come true.
Oh honey, we are so glad to have you back but you really don't remember anything?
I mean, one minute, I was being proposed to by a handsome Arabian prince, and the next thing I know,
Well, we put all your mail on the desk in your room, sweetheart.
Thanks, Lois. It's good to be up and gouging again.
I think my wife has been crossing the street with another man.
Coming this fall from the producers of Gone Baby Gone, comes the riveting sequel:
I promise you we are going to find your daughter.
Okay, but, you know, do-do what you can, but seriously, don't, like, kill yourself.
Oh, and if you do find her, honk this horn a couple times.
It's the only way to get her to stop biting you.
If you want to hang it somewhere, hang it in the basement.
Oh, why? So you can hog it while you're doing laundry?
Peter, I told you, I don't like all these strangers walking around in our house.
And if we don't show them we appreciate their loyalty, they're gonna go someplace else. For what?!
Not to alarm anyone, but some guy took me in the closet and tried me on.
Lois, I'd love nothing more than to sit here and chat with you, but I have a business to run.
Yes, my family and I would like our portrait painted.
Peter, what is that girl doing in my wedding dress?!
Okay, well, while I'm down here let me give you my card.
Here you go. A half pound of honey maple turkey, sliced thin.
You're running an unlicensed business, and that's against the law.
It's dark; it's cold; and hooking up is just a crapshoot 'cause of all the big coats.
Hey, you ever accidentally masturbate to young pictures of your mom?
I'm still just upset about the damn government sticking its nose in my business.
Bald eagles should be allowed to make their own decisions!
Just for Eagles will give you thicker, fuller, more natural hair... so you can just focus on eagle stuff.
Is it real or just another excuse for kids these days to forget their manners?
But first, thousands are expected for tomorrow's Tea Party rally celebrating their new Quahog headquarters.
The Tea Party has gained a sizable following based on their message of low taxes, limited government, and happy birthday, Tom...
Well, I'd like to be part of a movement, but what movement would want an angry fat guy with a lot of opinions who hates listening?
For more details on the Tea Party platform, we now go to this totally boss fireworks show.
Why are they trying to take that away from us?
I am going down to that rally tomorrow and I am joining the Tea Party!
Oh, wait, that's the same time as my men's knitting club, although they have been really critical lately.
I finally got something better to do with my Saturdays than sit at the mall and watch Japanese girls laugh at normal conversation.
Finally, I'm part of a movement of regular people trying to take back our government.
Look, the Tea Party isn't the grassroots movement you think it is.
It's actually funded by Big Business types who are using you to get the government out of their way so they can roll over everyone.
Mom held hands with a woman at the gas station this morning.
All I'm saying is you're being used and you're too clueless to know it.
It's a great way to stay in shape is what it is.
They got rides, games, and ethnic food cooked horribly by white Americans.
Would you like to buy a photo of yourself on the ride, sir?
It's great to see so many regular people out here.
Folks who are tired of big government and are ready to stand up for their rights.
And now, it's my privilege to introduce another regular, blue-collar guy, our Quahog chapter spokesman: Joe Workingman!
The government wants to tell you what foods to eat.
And that you can't own a chimpanzee because you're not responsible enough.
Also, the government wants to tell you how many children you can have.
And the government wants to tell you you can't throw your old TVs into the river.
If you join the Tea Party, together, we can fix all that.
But you probably don't wanna join the Tea Party because all you get are these stupid, awesome keychains!
I got to say that guy made a lot of sense.
The same way the Village People ruined any gathering of a cop, an Indian chief, and a construction worker.
Oh, my God, can we get a picture with you guys?
We've gotta solve that security problem for the Indian Casino we're constructing.
I'll catch up with you. I got to hit the john.
Hey, buddy. Is there a bathroom around here, or a second floor window?
This is what Brian was warning me about: that the Tea Party is run by rich guys who are only out for themselves.
Peter, he's just one of those liberal elites who spreads lies and hates patriots.
You and I are both businessmen who work hard and pay taxes.
I could actually use a regular guy like you to help get our message out, and I know Joe Workingman agrees with me.
Oh, it was great, and now I know it's the right cause to get behind
Look, I know what you're thinking, Brian, but don't worry; it's all okay.
Oh, of course, Carter Pewterschmidt, an industrialist with oil refineries in this city, is on your side.
He wants to get rid of environmental regulations for you.
Carter wants to get rid of the whole city government of Quahog.
He even put me in charge of the PR campaign to do it.
Peter, if I know my dad, he's probably using you.
Lois, I'm so glad you're done with the dishes so that you can hang out and chime in on this.
All right, now, remember, the Tea Party is a grassroots movement.
We're not covered by the lame-stream media, so we got to reach out to the common man individually.
This is the woman of the house, and there is no man living here.
W-W-What is... I-I... how are you paying for this phone?
Oh, I see, and are you in your little courthouse right now representing Barbie?
Yeah, I can't wait to fire all them city employees, starting with that half-asleep construction worker.
Is there anyone here for the couch off of Craigslist?
Well, I'm nothing if not a public servant, and the public has made its feelings known.
It has been my pleasure to serve you, and now I take my leave.
Our top story: Quahog is now completely government-free, which means I'm free of all broadcast regulations, so no more trips to the bathroom for this reporter, just a big-ass coffee can under the desk.
You know, for years I've been sick of taking the roads home, so today I took the yards.
Man, getting rid of the government has been the best thing to happen around here in a long time.
Without government I'm free to take a lot of mescaline and drive to Vegas.
Yeah, and now my Spanish teacher and I can finally hold hands in the halls.
Well, I'm glad you're all enjoying your freedom, but have you taken a look out the window lately?
The Pewterschmidt Industries refinery, and it's not smoke; it's a giant cloud of pollution.
If that gets past the bad neighborhoods and reaches us, that's going to be a big problem.
Then it's up to us, the people, to find a solution.
Damn it, this is what I was afraid was going to happen.
Historically, in instances of mass lawlessness, the first thing they do is round up the Jews.
Excuse me, fellow Aryan, have you seen any Jews around?
It's day five of the new government-less Quahog, and I'm wearing a T-shirt.
Tom, I don't think the government was requiring you to wear a suit.
Well, they were stopping me from punching you in the face.
There are power lines down, and there's no one to fix 'em.
The cops don't come, the toilets don't flush, and there's garbage piling up in the streets.
I had a nice life, but you and your antigovernment buddies ruined it.
Not having a government worked great in Somalia, but somehow we seem to have botched it all up.
Wait a minute. There might be a way out of this.
We just talk to the guy who got us into this.
Tampon commercials no longer use blue liquids in their demonstrations.
You show whatever you want, but you make it blue!
But if rich people aren't looking out for us, who is?
Well, maybe we need to look out for each other.
Wait, before you go, take two steps to the left.
Now that we've freed ourselves from the terrible shackles of government, it's time to replace it with something better.
The first thing we need is a system of rules that everyone must live by.
And since we can't spend all our time making rules,
I think that we should elect some people to represent us, and they should make rules and choices on our behalf.
Now, this may be kind of expensive, so I got a plan: everyone should have to give some money from their salaries each year.
Poor people will give a little bit of money and rich people will give a larger amount of money, and our representatives will use all that money to hire some people who will then provide us with social order and basic services.
Ugh, there's not one shirt I wish I had out there.
'cause later we're going to have more elections, and we can use those elections to get rid of the bad guys and replace 'em with good guys, and then the system will just keep going on and on just like that.
Will you join me in trying this new crazy thing?
A few years ago, we did an episode called Viewer Mail where you, our fans, wrote in and suggested ideas for new episodes.
Well, it's ten years later, but you're still sending in ideas.
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock, we wanna let you know we kicked around idea, Make the Baby Go Wild for a while, couldn't really find an angle on it.
Lee writes: Dear Family Guy, was your show based on anything?
In fact, Family Guy is based on an American television series called The Simpsons.
Actually, Family Guy, much like The Office, is based on a British series called Chap of the Manor.
Join us same time tomorrow if it's not entirely inconvenient for you.
If so, of course, we do understand and we do apologize in advance.
This has all been an imposition. I'm so dreadfully sorry.
Again? But Neville, you spend all your time down at the Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.
The Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock is for tossers.
We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat and Bull and Whistle and Fiddle and Cock and Pig and Wolf and Carriage and Fife and Other Wolf!
But I need you to stay and have a chat with Collingsworth.
I found him with another fag in his mouth this morning.
I just want a comely lass to look upon me with favour.
Coming up: a man with a gun and two bullets has taken over the city of Manchester.
But first, our top story tonight: Her Majesty, the Queen, will be passing through our very town tomorrow.
With details, we now go live to Indian reporter, Tricia Dasgupta.
Thank you, Tricia. After the interval, find out which 12 football teams tied tonight.
You know, I'm actually a relation of the royal family.
And I always heard my Nana talk about how she took a duke.
'cause every afternoon she'd be belly-achin' about her bloody duke.
No, I'm quite sure of it. And to prove it,
I'm gonna nick one of the Queen's hairs during her visit tomorrow.
And when the DNA proves a match, you'll see I'm royalty.
I'd like to mash my banger in her blood pudding.
Aye. I was spirited to have you down there watching me.
Well, it's a brilliant day for a long and confusing game of cricket.
The field is teeming with men in helmets who don't seem like they need helmets, and men not in helmets who seem like they probably should be wearing helmets.
Is that good? We don't know, but it's what we do!
Oh my goodness, the Queen is going to be here presently.
My favorite part before the Queen arrives is yelling wanker at Prince Charles as he passes.
I say, a lot of people have turned out to see the Queen.
A lock of the Queen's hair shall soon be mine.
Now, just walk away casual-like and we're in the clear.
Yeah, I reckon she's with Jesus Christ in heaven now.
Well, I'm just happy our family is safe and sound back in our cozy row house.
We now return to The Comedy Central Roast of Robin Williams.
He must be getting recognized for all his contributions to show business.
Robin, as a comic, it's an honor to be up here roasting you.
As a moviegoer, I want to punch you in the face.
Robin Williams has a manic gift that gladdens a sad world and all he asks in return is our unceasing attention!
You were in a coma, and then I kissed you, and you woke up.
I was covered once by an HMO in San Francisco.
Of course now everyone can afford health care because of Obama.
The price is free, but yo ass better vote for me.
What's going on in here? You gotta check this out!
He cures stuff the fun way, not the medicine way.
So, somehow the lightning gave your dad the power to turn anyone I touch into Robin Williams.
Peter, did Dr. Hartman say how long this was gonna last?
Bet you kids never thought your dad would have superpowers, huh?
Peter! Ho-ho! You pat my back, I pat yours, and Pat Robertson pats Mr. Happy.
Look, Brian! Meg is one of the sensitive, bearded Robin Williams characters.
The Grateful Dead. Please do not take the brown acid.
I don't know, Peter. This all seems kind of creepy.
I think I got just the thing to cheer you up, Joe.
I know I said I was a leg man, but this is ridiculous. Ho!
All right, Rupert, all we have to do is act like Robin Williams, and he'll think we've already changed.
Lots of energy! One good one for every ten! Ho-ho!
Go and spread your comedy to all corners of this country.
I guess Disney wouldn't let us do the Aladdin one.
Yeah, wipe it off and put it back in your purse, you white trash hen.
I'm gonna be busy with my job and my family.
It's one of my most important possessions, and I want you to have it.
Just done it so much I'm bored with it, that's all.
All right, you can do this, Stewie. Here we go.
Hey, kid, come here. I wanna see if I can still smell your mom's boobs on your mouth.
We sure got a lovely day for it, don't we?
My God, how the hell do I keep falling for that?
Now you play with your toys and I'll go get yo a nice, fluffy towel.
I'm swimming at night 'cause I'm a slut and now I'm paying the price for it.
Wow, looks like you got some cool bath toys in there.
Made some bad choices with women, but there's another way.
Oh, how 'bout this one? Good Night, Town from Footloose?
You spent the last ten minutes parked in front of the house crying in your car?
Fine, but if I gotta pee first, this night's gonna be ruined.
And now, Movie and a Bath with a Guy Named Lou.
Hey. It's Saturday night, and you know what that means.
We're gonna take a bath and watch the 1984 interesting movie, Gremlins.
I don't know if those things are puppets or they put costumes on dogs or something, but let's press play and find out, huh?
You can't get them things wet, by the way, but don't worry, this don't affect that.
We interrupt this program for some breaking news, which is why
A major drug bust in Quahog today as police seized over 100 kilos of cocaine.
That's right, Joyce. Apparently, there were 100 kilos of cocaine right here in Quahog, and yet my guy can't get dick.
Singled out for special recognition in orchestrating today's drug bust was Officer Joe Swanson.
It feels good to know that, thanks to me and my colleagues, a lot fewer people will be injecting cocaine into their penises tonight.
Now I have to go through the five stages of having a celebrity friend.
Just one stroke of luck, and you're there and I'm here.
I'm sorry I overreacted. Look, you got to be careful.
You need someone looking out for you, who knows you.
Thanks, Quagmire. I'll be honest, it was nice to be acknowledged by the chief for once.
Usually, he's just reminding me that whatever punk I'm roughing up ain't worth it.
You son of a bitch! I ought to kill you right here!
So, listen, if you guys aren't doing anything later, the chief's throwing me a little party to celebrate my bust.
I don't know if I can take another evening of sympathetic eye contact from all the other wives.
Well, just so you know, this is a really big deal.
They even asked me to be a guest on  Muy Importante!
I bet working here, she's one of those women who's tough as nails and good at giving sass.
I'd like to cram both your boobs into a martini glass.
And the biggest drug bust in the history of Quahog!
Is it true you got straight A's in Officer Henderson's Overintensity Workshop?
Yeah, sorry, I was just thinking about... someone should have come tonight, but they didn't.
I know. Who do you think is taking care of the city?
Well, under normal circumstances, you'd be right to say that, but in this case, cheating would be the only fair thing.
But I'm still not sure that's a reason to betray Bonnie.
Come on, Joe. Sleeping with this girl wi even things up.
You can't have that kind of imbalance in your relationship.
In fact, you owe it to Bonnie to have sex with this woman.
I go down there a couple times a week to have CB sex.
Ah, it's so hot just knowing you're in a truck.
I stepped over the line at the bar last night.
Wow. I've never seen a sofa in a bathroom stall before.
Well, I'm the only one who comes in here, so I figured I'd make it my own.
This is Kevin's first birthday since he came home from Iraq.
Why does Kevin always sit at the bus stop, but never gets on a bus?
The plane is sinking, so I need you all to proceed onto the floating slide.
And just so you know, the guy stewardess was angry gay, not happy gay.
I thought I would feel better after I slept with Nora, but I don't.
Guys, am I the only one who thinks it's weird talking about Joe cheating on Bonnie in front of their baby?
I think we can all benefit from a little strange now and then.
After all I do for you, this is how you repay me?
Well, how do you think I felt when I found out you slept with that French guy, huh?
In my defense, it is my experience that I am generally correct about most things.
Do you have any idea how hard it is living with you?
They still have one of those TVs with the big, fat back.
I got a license to operate a sex crane for you.
And I got earplugs so I could put up with that horrible voice of yours.
I perform purification rituals on my body after we have sex.
I find it cleanses the immeasurable sadness of having lain with a wretch.
Does the Swanson divorce mean that I have to go live with Grandma and Grandpa?
Peter, I can't believe you would encourage Joe to have an affair.
Boy, I never would have seen this day coming when we first met. Africa by Toto was playing.
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
So I figure, all we got to do is find a way to recreate the magic of that night.
'cause I just talked to Bonnie and she's already on D-Date.
But she found someone, and they're doing whatever they do tomorrow.
Thanks for inviting me to lunch, Lois, but why are we eating at a strip club?
Well, one of the dancers was dancing with a guy and saying, You're my favorite, you're my favorite, but now she's dancing with another guy.
Boy, I haven't heard this song in a long time.
I know I haven't been that easy to live with lately.
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
You'll never guess who I ran into at the market just now.
Ross' wife was with him, and in fact, they invited us all over for dinner tonight.
But I'm gonna stare at his wife's boobs so hard that when they both go into the kitchen together, it will be discussed.
Ah, the cold car ride through a dark, suburban night.
Yeah, I just got home from work, put down the lawyer's briefcase, and put on the chef's hat.
So, Peter, Lois tells me that you're working at the brewery.
Oh, do they do it so right at The Meadows.
Mr. Wiggins rested his thing on Jen Crosby's shoulder during a test.
Yes, I'm told James Woods High leads the nation in teacher-to-student thing resting.
Well, it's family that really matters, and no family is closer than ours.
I spat on a chick there at a work retreat.
I mean, no offense, but it doesn't look like your family would be up to the task.
All right, Griffins, on the ground, we're going to second.
This infield is the Great Wall of China: nothing's getting past us.
My voice sounds weird, this is weird, I know, but I feel fine.
Yeah, we should call Ross and tell him, This is the hospital, and your mom's dead.
And we'll be like, Saint Up Yours, and then... and then that's, like, two jokes.
I-It's just, that guy really got to me, and I wanted to stick it to him.
Will you call tomorrow and make some excuse that doesn't make me look bad?
Tell him I'm a pathological liar and that I've been under a lot of stress because of the child rape charges I'm facing.
You think I liked sitting there pretending to be polite to those people while they talked down to us like that?
I want to do something we can be proud of.
I want Stewie, Meg, and Chris to grow up with some confidence.
But if the Fishmans can do it, so can we.
Yeah, we're just as good as them or any other family.
Yay! I drank seven cups of coffee at the Fishmans'!
I could pee there, and then it would be mine.
Okay, gang, once we arrive in Nepal, we'll get all the supplies we need for the trip up Everest.
Okay, but remember, kids, the people there have never seen people before.
So when they walk up to you, quickly stuff a dollar bill in their mouth.
And then you can pet 'em as much as you want.
Nah, truth is, I don't know nothing about this place.
Okay, now, we got to make sure we've got all the provisions before we head up to base camp.
'Cause I don't think there's gonna be a Star Market halfway up the mountain.
Okay, let's split up and meet in an hour in front of The Yak Shack.
And my mom is pounding on the door, and I'm like, Mom, don't come in here.
So, I've been carrying this really promiscuous guide around, and my back starts itching.
I go to the doctor, turns out I got sherpies.
Peter, I don't think we need a donkey for this climb.
I don't know what it is, but you... have got... it.
Lois, this is probably a terrible time to remember this, but I think I might have left the weed whacker on.
Hey, listen, on a scale of one to ten, how bad is the bathroom situation up here?
Like, ten is a suite at the Four Seasons, and one is a tied-up raincoat sleeve at a party in your honor.
When our family says that we're gonna do something, we follow through with it.
Yeah, in fact, not only are we gonna climb it, we are gonna beat you guys to the top.
We are gonna beat you so bad, you'll think you gave Chris Brown an STD.
In fact, you probably won't even climb Everest at all.
Getting to the top ahead of you is gonna be one of the greatest moments of my life.
Okay, the Fishmans are heading up the North Face, but I've been studying this map and I think we've got a better chance of beating them if we go up the South Face.
Okay, can everyone just stop freaking out and just give me, like, two minutes?
All right, well, maybe we'll turn you on later and see how you feel.
You're just gonna have to block out the cold, Stewie.
It's okay! There's a huge pile of dead bodies down here that cushioned my fall!
Do any of them seem like they have any extra tampons in their backpack?
Uh, no! No, like you checked and there aren't any, no?
Hey, you know, I heard, when you drink at high altitude, it hits you even faster.
Hey, Sam, get back in here and carry my golf clubs.
I mean, there's no way other dogs can smell this.
So you guys enjoy it. We're gonna head back down.
You might want to take a look at those storm clouds.
All right, everyone get into a hilarious pose, so when they dig out our bodies, they'll have a good laugh.
And the scarf Brian called a gay waste makes a rather important appearance.
How the hell can we already be out of food?
Yeah, but by that I thought you meant a set list of totally awesome tunes, which I do have.
And after this, it's Everybody Dance Now and after that, it's Come Baby Come.
Oh, great. Not only are we caught in this blizzard, but there's some maniac up here freezing people to death.
Look, if we don't eat something soon, we're all gonna pass out from exhaustion and freeze to death just like him.
I hope Ben would forgive us for what we did.
Look, we needed to eat, the same way birds need to fly.
What do you mean, you don't have our names on there?
My wife and I absolutely have to be on this flight.
I think you'll find all the information you need on here.
Sir, this is just a piece of paper with the word south written on it.
I just hope he's not trapped in some crevice somewhere.
Well, my gut tells me he'll be squeezing himself out of a crevice very soon.
I say we leave her behind and marry that hot new assistant from my work.
But we just let Ross and Pam walk back up there, probably to their deaths.
Tell me again why we ate a person before we ate the dog.
Plus, if we don't rescue the Fishmans, their Jewish god is just gonna sit there and make us feel guilty.
We got to get them out! They'll die down there!
You're the only one strong enough to carry two people.
And Peter, I'll never forget what you did for us.
Yeah, you kids always loved your first trip to the fire station.
Let me know if you have any questions that I can answer for you.
You waiting for some guy to fall asleep with a cigarette?
Over here is our kitchen, where we make all our meals.
Sometimes we don't see them for long periods of time.
Hey, Chris, you think it's safe to drink from a fire hose?
Now, few people realize that until 1928 there were no hoses, and you actually had to fight fires with your bare hands.
Now I'm gonna put on my pants and go talk to my coworkers at...
Well, I hope everyone had a fun afternoon at the firehouse.
I want to see if there's a response to all those fan letters I've been writing.
I have been meaning to contact you for some time.
I have never been able to figure out if you are famous.
You were a big deal in one thing, but you were wearing a mask for most of it.
Hey, there's something here from the Nielsen Company. Dear Griffin family, You have been specially selected from amongst millions of American households to be a Nielsen family, and as such, to have your TV viewing habits monitored in order to measure television ratings.
Well, Meg, it sounds like they want us to be part of a select group of people that helps determine what's on TV.
Now, this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
And what was that beginning, middle and end part again?
Um... this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
Is there any way you can describe that to me using colorful puppets of some sort?
I don't like the left puppet. His chin is scary.
You know, guys, this is a real opportunity to promote quality programming.
You donated once five years ago and they sent you a mug.
And now the mug's so old that the P has been worn off so it just says B.S.
It's libtards like you that are screwing up our country.
Just hoping you plan to watch the Channel Five News.
Well, we'd sure love to have you as a viewer.
Is there anything we can do to make the news more appealing to you?
And that'll do it for us here at Channel 12 News.
Well, I suppose I could lose it and just use more makeup.
And maybe a festive hat would make things more festive.
Yeah, can you end each show by trying to pull-start a very cold chain saw?
These boots are the new you, and no one will shake that.
If anyone asks, you forgot the boots in your locker.
Tonight, Channel Five mourns the loss of a dear colleague.
And as per the wishes of my moustache, his ashes were sprinkled off the coast of Acapulco where he was born.
Thanks for watching Channel Five, the most trusted name in news.
If I knew he was gonna do all that stuff I told him,
Yeah, he came to my house when he found out
I was a Nielsen family, asked what I wanted to see.
If he did the news with a family of prairie dogs, and whenever he said something sad, they'd pop their heads up, all concerned.
People rely on the local news to provide them with several stories a year on how saltwater taffy is made.
Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family, it seems like you should maybe be a little more thoughtful with your choices.
For God's sakes, I've just been handed the coolest freaking toy on the planet.
Chilling news from Long Island Sound, as a four-passenger prop plane on its way to East Hampton spun into the surf off Montauk Point.
Oh, that's so great, I just called him on the way home!
Hell, I wish I could do it with all the shows.
I guess that means I'll never get to see an episode of Superman where Clark Kent and Lois Lane finally get together.
Lois, I love you, and I want there to be no more secrets between us.
Just thought I'd stop by and make sure your equipment is working properly and see if you have any questions.
Well, I'm just gonna change out the card on your unit real quick and I'll be on my way.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Listen, did I catch you at a good time, or are you and the critics busy sucking each other's butts?
But don't worry, I got some ideas on how you can jazz it up.
I've been a big celebrity for a year and a half now.
And so, gentlemen, in baseball, three strikes and you're out.
But I'm afraid we're going to have to take our business elsewhere.
I don't know what it was, but now it's on roller skates.
If anybody knows what America wants in the '90s, it's NBC.
I like Dateline, but I really hate waiting two hours to find out who the killer is.
I knew it was the ex-boyfriend. Sleep tight, truck. Sleep tight, firefly. Sleep tight, chair.
Uh, now, I'm just gonna vamp for a while with some random noises.
And, uh, here's Paul to play you to sleep with a lullaby.
He sneaks up and scares the girls while they're starting businesses or getting their fat waxed.
I've got to swallow all my valuables and get out of here!
You put a real cougar on Cougar Town, and now that cougar's dead because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws!
You're just jealous 'cause I get to say what's on TV now!
Please, Doc, you got to help me with this nasty gash.
Oh. Well, you've got a lot of nerve coming in here after what you did to television.
You took an oath when you went to medical school.
I took a lot of things when I went to medical school.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to answer this.
Aw, come on, let me make it up to you.
This is Peter Griffin, and you're listening to Book Talk on WRNI.
Less Than Zero, a tale of privilege, detachment and youthful alienation.
Tune in tomorrow when we will look at John Kennedy Toole's unheralded early work, The Neon Bible.
I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me?
The networks never should have listened to you in the first place.
This is exactly what makes bad television: pandering to the lowest common denominator.
That means you still have the power to influence television.
Maybe you can use that power to help restore TV to the way it was.
Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows, that'll help get things back to the way they were.
There goes your one chance to get TV back to the way it was.
I'm the guy who ruined television, and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it.
I broke television, and now you have to help me fix it!
Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today because you are the creators of what television used to be before I ruined it.
And we need to rebuild television from the ground up.
J.J. Abrams, you take wonder and complexity and present it in a way that no one can possibly understand.
I've got an alien that goes back in time and encounters a koala bear in an Eastern European town.
Okay, now, we're gonna need where people talk to the camera for some reason.
When Peter told me to make a workplace comedy where people talk to the camera, I thought...
Wonder if I can pull off one of those can you believe what I have to put up with looks to the camera.
Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible, unforgiveable things to each other for embarrassingly small sums of money?
All right, now, who's gonna make a show about horrible New Jersey freaks?
Okay, Dick Wolf, make the same Law and Order six times.
Ah. Then I shall take my ease on the lanai.
Yeah, guys, I'm sorry for screwing up all your favorite shows.
Yeah, and these are the best seats in the house for catching home run balls.
The only souvenir I ever got was at that stock car race.
Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah!
I can wait. I might-- I might wait for a stall.
If I don't start peeing soon, it's gonna be weird.
Your dad fought in World War II, and you can't even pee in a urinal?
Now batting for the Red Sox, number 34, David Ortiz.
And now it's time for the Channel Five Sports Report brought to you by Kia.
A big day at Fenway today, as the Red Sox bested the Yankees seven to six.
But what really has everyone talking is the fan who lost his toupee at the game.
The hilarious video already has over two million views on YouTube.
Comments ranged from sympathy all the way to racial slurs directed at others who chose to comment.
Well, it's just a thought, but have you ever considered just embracing your baldness?
You know, there's lots of big Hollywood celebrities who have gone bald with dignity.
And besides, don't you think you'll be happier just being who you really are?
I mean, wh-what other choice do I have at this point?
I've already gone on a hike and fixed a few things around my house!
Dad, there's a weird bald guy out in front of our house.
I'm just letting all these hot-rodders know that this is a neighborhood, not a speedway track.
Okay, well, how come you're not doing this in front of your own house?
Talked to a fella in Papua New Guinea last night.
You should come by sometime and join in the fun.
I'd just like to return this VHS copy of Pete's Dragon.
Uh, yes. Do you have a garbage can back there?
I have the backings to some Fruit Roll-Ups I need to discard.
I'll just hold on to these for the rest of the day.
Yeah. Is there an age restriction for the sleight-of-hand magic show this afternoon?
Maybe I'll just stand in the hallway and look in.
Now, we all saw you put your card back in the deck.
So, how did it end up... in your shirt pocket?
You notice now that he's bald, whenever he thinks about something, he scratches his wrist?
I was planning on looking at pictures of birds later, and I don't want to be all fuzzy-headed for that.
Yeah, now you're always either preparing for a colonoscopy or just coming back from a colonoscopy.
So... I-I'm not sure what you want me to do.
Oh, yeah. Like one of those guys pretending to get out of the pool.
Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me the last couple weeks. Hey, no problem.
You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.
Easy now. That's my privilege as a doctor to talk about that stuff.
Good. Me and Joe can stay here and tell secrets.
Oh, my God. One of my patients on Two has been shot.
Listen, I was at the hospital earlier, and I heard something I wish I hadn't.
Oh, please do not tell me it was a sexist remark, because... because that is not okay.
You know, those nurses are busting their asses, weighing people and seeing how tall they are.
Stewie, I heard a doctor tell Carter he has two weeks to live.
Oh, I've got a nanny cam hidden inside his house.
Although I'm not sure what the Spanish word no means, because it doesn't seem to mean the same thing as it does here.
And the worst part is, I don't think Lois even knows he's sick.
And then we have a chocolate, chocolate cake that's infused with chocolate served with chocolate ice cream and a molten chocolate topping.
More like four of those with one spoon for me!
Listen, I have something I need to tell you, but... it might be difficult for you to hear.
I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer... and that he has two weeks to live.
Yeah, I feel really horrible for you, and I hate to do this, but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie, and it's, like, 4:40 now, and, so, if I'm going to make it,
Yeah, this-this stinks, but I've already blown this guy off, like, twice, so...
I've been trying to call my parents all day, and I can't get ahold of them.
I'll tell ya, this obituary came out great. Carter Pewterschmidt died today of the disease cancer. In lieu of flowers, please send carnival rides to Peter Griffin at 31 Spooner Street.
If we get just one ride out of this, it will have been a success.
Brian, how could you get us all worked up like that?!
Last night, Carter was on his deathbed, and now he looks better than he ever did.
You know, that uncle that sit around in the house all day in his underdrawers, saying he between jobs.
To be between jobs, you had to have had a job in the first place!
Stewie, this is going to sound crazy, but I have a theory about what's going on with Carter.
If Carter Pewterschmidt, the dynamic chairman of Pewterschmidt Industries, were to fall ill or even die, the stock price would plummet.
I don't want you to think I'm not listening, but when's Christmas? Not for a while.
But what I'm saying is, I think Carter is sick or possibly even dead, and that the man we saw today was an imposter brought in to keep
Pewterschmidt Industries' stock price up and to keep people from knowing the truth.
Boy, you are just going to keep on talking with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth, aren't you?
I'm supposed to talk to the police about that shooting I witnessed.
If I die, leave two dollars worth of flowers right here.
And have a gap-toothed woman say, quote, He never bothered nobody.
Okay, if this guy is an imposter, he's going to have to do everything Carter normally does.
We just have to wait and see if he slips up.
If this is an imposter, then this guy we're following never had cancer.
No, that's just a myth we started so we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs.
Wow. You certainly look a lot better than that walking corpse I saw last week.
I can't stress how important it is our secret be kept from the public.
And I assure you that Specimen Z is secure on level 12.
And I bet Specimen Z is the real Carter's body.
Hey, buddy, we're... we're just trying to read the paper here.
I'll have you fired for talking to me like that.
All right, we're just going to have to try and figure out the code.
All right, now, where would they keep a dead body in a pharmaceutical lab?
But holy crap, wind 'em up and watch 'em go.
I don't know. When... when was that Who Let the Dogs Out? song?
You know when Who Let the Dogs Out? came out?
Why the hell would you keep it buried like this?
Because there's far more money to be made in treating a disease than in curing it.
Why cure someone of cancer in a day if we can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step along the way?
Brian, it's so cold in here, look how big my nips are.
Oh, look, I'm tugging at 'em and they're getting even bigger.
Carter, what you're doing here is criminal, and I'm going to tell the whole world about it.
Big corporations never tell the truth. ok at the Kleenex industry.
I guess a lot of people are sneezing out there.
Jerry, I'm going to let you in on something, and it can't leave this room.
Our research shows the primary use of our product is sperm.
I can't believe Carter would sacrifice millions of lives just to protect corporate profits.
Old Stewie here snagged a little souvenir on his way out.
Oh, it was easy-- I just took it while you guys were yammering on.
I swear, I felt like I was waiting for Lois to get off the phone.
All right, well, you know the mall with the Chili's?
Lois, your father has a cure for cancer, but he won't release it because it's not profitable.
So I found the cure for cancer and didn't announce it.
Big deal. I also took a dump today and didn't issue a press release.
You've got more money than anyone could ever spend in one lifetime.
'cause your parents were too wealthy and busy got cancer?
What if I got cancer or, God forbid, one of your grandchildren?
Our top story: a big announcement out of Pewterschmidt Pharmaceuticals today.
Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt released a statement announcing the launch of a deodorant for the developmentally disabled called Slow Stick.
It's also edible because, you know, those people... don't, uh... don't know...
That son of a bitch went back on his word.
Daddy, we're all sitting here in front of the TV awaiting the big announcement.
The one you promised to make for me, your daughter?
He'll just do a magazine cover with a wink to who he is, and all will be forgiven.
Yeah, and these are the best seats in the house for catching home run balls.
The only souvenir I ever got was at that stock car race.
Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah!

He'll just do a magazine cover with a wink to who he is, and all will be forgiven.
The only way I believe I'm pretty is if strangers have sex with me.
Well, maybe I could help fill you up with self-confidence.
If you ever need cinder block, I can get you good price.
I-I have a six-CD changer, so you can pretty much fill the tray and create a world.
My mother will make you farkshekoosh when we are done.
Why do you keep a sleeping baby in your time machine room?
He doesn't have to sit through the rest of the show.
HERBERT MORRISON: The frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast! Oh, the humanity!
And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, there's a dog having sex with a woman!
Oh, I know I said, Oh, the humanity! before, but seriously, oh, the humanity even more right now!
Wow, Brian, you've had quite a string of female guests spend the night lately.
You should see the way I have to pick up chicks.
Well, I guess you can call me the Man of La Muncha.
Hey, why does your time machine have a sticker that says property of Stewie Griffin?
All right, to be completely honest, and because we've already had sex, it's not mine.
I use it all the time, and the owner has no idea.
Really? Won't he see that thing on the control panel that says years traveled?
That's what I do when I take my dad's car out.
Well, I think someone has a Barnes & Noble gift card coming for their silence.
I-I saw Meg leaving a minute ago, going, Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha, but I-I don't know.
You bastard! You've been using my time machine to nail your bar skanks!
Brian, I want you to tell me exactly what you did to my time machine.
Well, I didn't want you to find out I'd been using it, so I tried turning the chronological gauge backward.
The question is, how am I going to fix it?
I don't know what the hell you did with all your messing around, Brian, but somehow my machine seems to have reversed the direction of time.
Well, clearly, when you attempted to reverse the gauge on my time machine, you somehow released a quantum shock wave powerful enough to push the flow of time in the opposite direction.
I can only surmise that you and I were isolated from its effects because we were inside the machine at the moment of temporal inversion.
What kind of jerk alters time, and then falls asleep?
Look, I'm sorry, Stewie, but do you think you can fix it?
Well, it's gonna take a while to rebuild the machine, and even longer to recalibrate it for normal time, but I've taken on bigger challenges before.
I had to explain to America why Heidi Klum broke up with Seal.
Oh, my God, it just went back in my body.
Hey, Lois, I'm home from the Clam, and I'm horny.
Hmm. Seems like reverse time did that kid a favor.
They all seem to be completely unaware that anything is amiss.
(squeaking) Your trash barrels were a little close to our driveway. Joe. P.S. Please close the windows when you're giving piano lessons.
Okay, Seamus, today's the day you finally ask out that barista.
You know, that chicken's kid is in my preschool class.
I don't really want to be friends with him, but he knows a lot of chicks.
Oh, Brian, this is gonna be more difficult than I thought.
In reverse time, the Republicans make outrageous statements and then the host asks an unrelated question.
Man, we got a large number of clovers on our lawn.
Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago, yet we only just recently entered reverse time.
Well, it suggests that time may not simply be flowing backwards; it may, in fact, be accelerating.
Have you ever heard of a phenomenon called time dilation, Brian?
Time dilation, in forward time, is a phenomenon caused by a variety of factors in which time moves more slowly.
In reverse time, it stands to reason that the same phenomenon would cause time to accelerate.
I'll have to consult my quantum calculations to try to isolate the factors responsible.
This is more intense than when I fought a rabbit in that karate tournament.
Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time is beginning to affect us as well.
Like that time I forgot what came after G and had to fake it.
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P  Ah-blah, blah-blah, blah-nah-wah
Q, R, S, T, U, V  Standing here with these kids
W, X, Y and Z  Waiting for the song to end
Now I know my A-B-Cs  Yankee Doodle went to town
Next time won't you sing with me?   Now I know my A-B-Cs.
Oh, God, it's not gonna be coming out of us; it's gonna be going... (vomit noise)
Brian, if we don't find a way to push time forward again soon,
That guy's gonna feel so much better after we do what we got planned.
Now all I've got to do is isolate the cause of the acceleration curve and see if I can duplicate the shock wave.
Uh-oh. I think I know what that major trauma was.
I saw my Spanish teacher leave one of you in a trash can.
Well, Lois, this kind of completes your little carnival here.
You ever need white, corner-of-the-mouth stuff, you come to your grandpa.
What? Stewie, I don't know how to fix that machine.
Just write down however you think you're talented, and I'll sign it.
Oh, my God, it's the greased-up deaf guy running backwards toward that grease truck explosion.
(in deeper voice): Boy, I am late for that meeting.
All right, could it be as simple as this? Invert time flow.
That's all I have to do, right, is duplicate the circumstances, but do it the opposite way.
All right, I was standing right here, the machine was on, I broke the glass... and I turned the gauge backward.
I take it back, those panties are gonna be in the way.
I didn't think you were gonna be able to pull it off, but you did it.
You know, I forgot what a man cave I had in Lois's uterus.
While I was waiting for you, I was shooting pool.
Had to hold the cue at weird angles, but still.
This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby The Shirt Briggs, notorious for always wearing shirts while committing his crimes, has finally been caught after 15 years on the lam.
A police spokesperson was quoted as saying, Duh, I'm a dumb cop.
Bobby Briggs is the one who put me in this wheelchair.
Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs is the one who crippled you?
You always told us you fell off a roof during a fight with the Grinch.
I lied because I was ashamed of the real story: that I let a vicious criminal get away.
Briggs was one of the biggest heroin dealers east of Providence, which is mostly just open water, but still, I'd been undercover, tracking his operation for six months and had finally gained his confidence.
I had almost gathered enough evidence to put Briggsaway for good, but I knew a taped confession would make the case a slam dunk.
We're gonna be banging so many hot chicks with jeans up to their navels.
Then get ready to spend the rest of your life as a lame gimp with an annoying-voiced wife.
Briggs got away, and I've been in this wheelchair ever since.
I like that you can tell me a story starting at the Clam and ending on a Ferris wheel.
Yeah, people are starving in Africa, and I'm at a carnival with my best buddies on a beautiful night.
So, Joe, it must feel great to finally have some closure with Bobby Briggs.
You know last night was the first time in 15 years
Again recapping our breaking news, longtime fugitive Bobby Briggs has escaped from police custody.
News of Briggs's escape first broke on Telemundo, if you can believe that.
Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.
Well, this seems like a good time to be heading out.
Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge.
And Mr. Con Man here can have pudding or ice cream, not both.
Yeah, but first, you have to agree there's a huge difference between bisexual men and homosexual men.
Well, Chief, I'm here because I want you to put me on the Briggs case.
I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it because they're so far from the case, they don't care about it at all.
You get me the guy who's been rubbing his butt all over Dunkin' Donuts.
Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down about this Briggs thing, and that kind of bums me out, so I got you this Cookie Puss.
I just don't think I could live with Briggs on the lam for another 15 years.
I can't do anything about it. The chief won't let me.
Joe, if they don't find this guy, it's gonna eat you alive for the rest of your life.
Quagmire and I will help you bring this guy to justice.
Peter, what did I say about you volunteering me for?
Well, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna need someone who's very good at disguise.
I'm supposed to be the gift table at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow.
All right, if we're gonna go after Briggs, this might be a good place to start.
I've spent the last 15 years gathering information on him, and it's all here.
Joe, your 25-year-old son and your baby daughter share a room just so you can keep a weirdo Beautiful Mind room?
And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls so they couldn't be traced back to us.
Briggs' FBI profile says the only relationship he's maintained over the years is with a stripper named Tanya.
Tax records show she currently works at a club in Atlantic City.
Hey, listen, thanks for agreeing to take care of Principessa while we're gone, Lois.
I can trace her lineage to the cats kept by Cleopatra.
Also, she's very skittish, so you have to touch her like this.
Hey, you guys, check out the look on Lois's face when I do this.
Boy, it'll be satisfying to finally slap the cuffs on Briggs once and for all.
Hey, you ever just drive through a town and wonder, Who the hell lives here? All the time.
That Chinese restaurant still has the sign from when it was a mechanic.
I don't want to eat lo mein where they were just changing mufflers.
I'm telling you, the Founding Fathers would be very disappointed in where their country ended up.
And so I say unto you, sons of liberty, no longer will free men live under the yoke of giant predatory birds.
We got to see if we can find Briggs's girl.
Hey, Quagmire, you, uh... you ever been to Atlantic City before?
All I need is one dance, and I'll know everything she knows.
I want you to tell me where I can find Bobby Briggs.
Come on, you know I can't give out a client's personal information.
All right, I'm gonna have to do the Vulcan V-Meld.
He lives at 2820 Ocean Boulevard, across from the park, apartment two.
Boy, it sure is nice having Mr. Quagmire's cat around.
I got to say, cats are so much better than dogs.
Okay, show me one way in which cats are better than dogs.
Well, okay, uh, for one thing, they always land on their feet.
Here, go ahead, do what you just did, but with me.
We need one of those boards they use for football players! Ow!
I just figured out why cats are better than babies.
If I don't get this, she's going to kill me.
Oh, I don't like that. Yeah, you don't like it.
And you're a fat nobody, and I'm  Spider-Man, so how do you think I feel?
You caught that guy who was killing all those Filipino girls.
Like switchblade-wielding white guys from movies and TV who don't talk like people talk.
Hand over that purse, and everything will be real cool, you dig?
Yeah, the bastard's making a break for it, just like South America.
Why would the cops arrest us instead of going after Briggs?
That's one of the corrupt cops who helped harbor Briggs while he was on the lam for 15 years.
We're going to have to go with the acetylene torch penis.
Well, I don't know if it helps, but I found this number next to the phone in his kitchen.
I was saving it 'cause I was going to make a scrapbook of the trip for you guys.
There's only one road into Juarez, and it goes through El Paso.
Joe, how do you know the area code for Juarez, Mexico?
There was a stem cell doctor I went down there to see.
All right, guys, the next flight to El Paso leaves in 40 minutes.
I mean, the last plane I was on got gay-jacked.
Yeah. And look, she fell asleep with the cat right on her chest.
Geez, how long we got to stand out here like this?
It's going to be at least a couple of days.
Well, what are we going to do for two days in El Paso?
Or we could visit the Pershing House where John Pershing took control of the Eighth Army Brigade in 1914.
You're not going to get away this time, you son of a bitch.
Do you have any idea what it's like to have to lift yourself into a wheelchair every morning?
To have your wife look at you like you're half a man?
To board a plane early with the first-class people and gold card members?
I only said that last thing 'cause it seemed cool.
Guys, I can't thank you enough for what you did.
You risked your lives for me, and I couldn't have done it without you.
Yeah, and thanks for letting me fire a few rounds into Briggs's corpse.
That was the most powerful I've felt in a couple years.
Well, you guys helped me finally have some closure in my life.
Joe, you have blood just pouring out of your pant leg.
Yeah, can you get me a chess set and a backwards hat?
Hey, Lois. Doesn't, uh, somebody have a birthday coming up this week?
Oh, it's nice of you to remember, Brian, but, frankly, I'd rather let this one slip by.
I don't need to be reminded how old I'm gettin'.
You keep so busy with your kids, time just seems to slip away, and then you turn around one day and...
You know, Peter, I know Lois is downplaying it, but I think she might actually appreciate it if we threw her a party.
I mean, I had a great time at my baby shower.
Oh, my God, I hope the guys at Sears portrait studio will be able to retouch this.
Tell me something: What do you think about Rose McGowan?
You know, she's got like a cute tomboy thing where you feel like you could play softball with her, and then later on, give her the old sau-seege.
We've got that unspoken bond that all bald guys have.
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. All right, you guys, that was Lois. She's gonna be here in ten minutes.
Dad, how did you get Mom out of the house so we could decorate?
Well, Chris, I constructed a very elaborate fake grocery store.
This is my fire truck, my Slinky, my Silly Putty.
You know, Silly Putty's awesome, but you know what's really cool? Serious Putty.
We thought it would be better if you heard it from chemicals in an egg.
Oh, and get this: I brought him home today, and coincidentally this is the day
Hey, anytime you can celebrate the end of someone's periods.
What were once two firm, impressive mountain peaks have become a barren, strip-mined, muddy landslide that droops ever downward.
What were once pink and succulent rose petals now take the form of the shredded, raggedy, blown-out endpiece of a practical joker's exploding cigar.
Lois, you may not be the young filly you were when I met you, but you're still my reliable old plow horse who's there each day to pull the plow, to help around the barn, and let the husband horse-slap a batch at her now and then.
And I have a lovely gift of the batchslapping variety waiting for you when I'm just the right amount of drunk.
Peter, she was already feeling insecure about her age, and then you went and gave her that horrible speech!
She never came to bed last night, and I can't find her anywhere.
I got highlights, I went shopping, and I had my...
Peter, I think Lois might be having a midlife crisis.
Come on, dudes! Who wants to hop in my wheels and head to the beach for some ultimate Frisbee?
But look who just got herself a sick new tat.
I guess one of my flaws is I'm just kinda brave.
No, that's great actually, because now anyone walking behind you will know that you had $60.
'Cept it's not payin' someone to install a PlayStation in a car.
Good. Then that means my ass is gonna look young forever.
Guys, I, uh, I gotta go shoot one into the sink.
Okay, now, I'm an excellent night nurse, so you two get some much-deserved sleep and don't worry about a thing.
I will take such loving care of this wonderful little gift.
And when you wake up, well-rested, your precious little baby will be smiling as bright as the sun.
I can only imagine Madeline would say, Take me out of this disgusting French hospital and find me some real parents.
Who the hell uses a razor blade as a bookmark?!
I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff going on around here lately.
Well, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for those things.
I mean, they're real good for seeing forks but not much else.
I am gonna hit her with my dry, withered belt.
Do me, Peter, do me right here in the basement.
Wow, Lois, I got to say, I like this new you.
Yeah, and my hearing's a lot better, so I hear, like, suction and stuff.
All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Well, long as I'm up, I might as well go spit in Lois's mouth.
I-I-- Where was I supposed to be offended within that remark?
Well, I did at first, but the novelty's worn off.
Same thing happened with that blog I started on 9/11.
Look, Peter, you do what you want to do, but I'm going to that party.
So if you don't want to run with the wild horses, then go back to the barn and go to bed.
I don't know what she's trying to prove, Brian, but I can't take it anymore.
It's no wonder she's trying to prove she's young and vibrant.
The city of Quahog has been stricken with a case of Bieber Fever tonight, as teen idol and fake black guy Justin Bieber is in town for a sold-out show at the Quahog Civic Center.
We now go live to Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa with more.
Tom, I'm standing here at the Quahog Civic Center, awash in a pool of prepubescent sexual moisture.
If I'm the one who made her feel this way, then I'm the one who's got to fix it.
Rupert, the man from the newspaper would like a quote from you about my dancing abilities.
If he did this to you, I swear I'll kill him!
What, you think you're not gonna get old, you little bastard?!
No, Peter. I don't want to act my age, and you don't want that either.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me an old plow horse.
I mean, every guy who's been married a while thinks he wants a hot, young chick, but after you spend an hour with one of them, you want to blow your brains out.
But, Peter, I was just doing this to make you happy.
But you got to admit, I'm not what I used to be.
Look, Lois, I'll always treasure the wild, little hottie I met when I was young.
But I don't want to be with a kid anymore.
There he is. The reason my bedpost is so shiny.
With the Earth destroyed, we're the only two humans left.
Well then, it looks like we need to start repopulating.
No, she's got to learn to breathe out of her nose.
Sure thing, honey. Adam and Eve on a raft, wreck them!
I'd like a hotdog with ketchup and some Jell-O, please.
Paint a bow-wow red and a side of nervous pudding!
Can I have a well-done burger with lettuce and tomato?
Burn one, drag it through the garden, pin a rose on it!
She's taped photographs of Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry on the inside cover, as if she's some sort of hip hybrid of those two things.
Brian, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was not written by Virginia Woolf.
Let's, uh, let's just get into this, huh? Dear Diary, got down to 152 today.
Oh, here's another one. Dear Diary, just discovered the music of John Denver.
Hey, look at this. Kent is so incredibly sexy. He said 'hi' to me today, and I almost died. Also, I learned a funny lesson today in my pursuit of Kent: anal bleaching is better left to professionals. LOL.
Oh, oh! No, no, no, come on, now, come on.
Jeez, it's just pages and pages of stuff about this Kent guy.
You're a whore, Sheila, and I'm gonna make sure everybody knows it!
Bye, overzealous Asian kids lining up to be the first ones in school tomorrow.
Sir, do you want to move ahead on the agreement with the sanitation union?
Well, there's this guy I like at school, and I was thinking about,
Meg, are you asking, in this day and age, when the CEO of Xerox is a woman, when the president of Brazil is a woman, even Rosie O'Donnell is a woman, whether it's appropriate for a girl to ask a boy out on a date?
It's also sad and desperate and I would never do it, but you're not me, are you, sweetie?
And the Facebook campaign to get me to kill myself?
I was just wondering if you maybe wanted to hang out some time?
Oh, my God, I'm going out on a date with Kent Lastname.
That's still being worked out by a team of counselors.
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Oh, my God, I thought you...
I didn't think this was a date. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed!
I'm sorry, Meg. I think you're great, and I love hanging out with you, but there's something you should know.
Look, I really like you as a friend, but to be honest...
I have a shoe appointment in the morning, and I want to be fresh!
I mean, it won't matter once I explain to him what's going on with us.
But what would I tell him is going on with us?
And it's-it's just in that I don't want to give it to a friend stage, you know?
Kent told me he's gay, and even worse, he likes Chris!
I've been going to high school with him for three years, and I always assumed he was straight.
Maybe he thought he was straight, but then realized he's gay.
Hey, you know, it was really cool meeting you the other night.
Sure. I sleep for, like, six hours every day after school, but other than that, I'm pretty open.
And you only use hello as a greeting, not as a way to outdo some imaginary antagonist in conversation.
Yeah, that's... that's not supposed to be there, so she should probably always wear a hat.
But, you know, the heart wants what the heart wants.
I just hope it doesn't cause awkwardness, you know, in the house.
Oh, no, it doesn't have to be awkward, not if we don't make it awkward.
That thing should be hanging from the ceiling of a deli.
Am I the only one who feels like grabbing a drink?
Just stick your head in here and pretend it's a butt.
In fact, I don't even think I can be your friend.
And I like musicals. I've even seen the latest Tony Award-winning piece of crap.
They're singing right near me, so it's a great musical.
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of sweet guy-trim at this school.
I feel like if I could just know what it's like to be with him, just-just once,
Well, if Kent hooks up with your brother, you could just have Chris describe every last detail to you.
I mean, if I can't have Kent, then that's the next best thing.
I've just got to get Chris to sleep with him.
Here comes Mr. Davis with one of his technically-not- illegal invitations.
I've put Stewie in the oven a bunch of times.
As long as you come to your senses within 15 minutes, everything's fine.
Lois, can I go Slip 'N Slide in the yard?
Okay, I just want to be sure you don't get a cramp.
Um, remember that free hug coupon you gave me for my ninth birthday that I never used?
Chris, please, just sleep with Kent and then tell me all about it.
You know, I wish I were secure enough to throw on any old thing and call it an outfit.
That's my sarcastic way of saying it's not gonna happen.
Yeah, I know, but I asked someone to do me a favor, and they're not too keen on doing it.
Yeah, yeah, mostly A's and B's so far this semester.
All right, I talked to Chris, and he totally wants to hook up with you, too.
It's just that he's not as comfortable with his sexuality as you are yet, so he's gonna need to pretend to be asleep while it's happening.
Wow, I didn't know Chris had this dark side to him.
I know you've been having a hard time lately, so I wanted to give you something that means a lot to me.
This was the trip our family took to the Cape.
It was raining, and Mom and Dad fought the whole time.
You taught me how to hunt squirrels with poisoned cheese, and then you took me to the hospital when the squirrels tricked me into eating the cheese.
Yeah, it's gotten me through a lot of tough times.
Hey, so can I have some of that Kool-Aid now?
Kent, I just texted you that the plan was off.
I was so obsessed with Kent that I-I guess I wasn't thinking straight.
I'm just glad I stopped before I did a really terrible thing.
I lied when I told you that Chris wanted to sleep with you.
I know you feel terrible, but you're not a bad person, Meg.
You just need to get back out there, and someday, maybe you'll find the right guy.
All it takes is one guy making one mistake, one drunken night.
You refusing to do what a sane woman would do.
Do you want an excuse to not go home this Christmas?
At Northwest Airlines, thousands of employees are dedicated to delaying and cancelling flights so you won't get home for the holidays.
Don't worry, I'm taking this flight back to the gate.
Do you think Jeff will make it home this year?
You know, I think this is gonna be our best Christmas ever.
I couldn't afford to get you what I got you last year.
I know how you like that song, so I got you two turtledoves.
I went to a scientist and had them genetically engineered.
Look, Stewie, I'm hanging the ornament you made at preschool.
Peter, you want to put the star on top of the...
Hang on, hang on, Lois, I always wanted to do this.
Eh, it's something, but you still got a leftover R.
I can only imagine what it must have been like for them on that very first Christmas.
Now, gather around, everybody, and hear the awe-inspiring tale that's caused millions and millions of deaths.
Many years ago there was a hardworking young carpenter named Joseph, and one day, Joseph and his friend Robby were hanging...
Anyway, Joseph and Robby were hanging out one day when this happened...
So, I went to see that new Oedipus play last week.
Can't you just imagine her standing on people's front lawns inside a cut-in-half bathtub?
You should go talk to her and see if she can talk.
Listen, um, I was wondering if you'd like to go out sometime.
You know, there's a beautiful spot outside of town where they dump all the foreskins.
Oh, great, and maybe we could slaughter a lamb and light it on fire so that it rains.
I've got to go sit in a circle with the other women and stare off into the fields.
Yeah, I just hope it goes better than my last one.
When you said I could do you in your mudhut,
Not just because Mary was a virgin, but because baseball would not be invented for 1,800 years and nobody knew what the hell he was talking about.
You know this is the same picnic basket we drowned my sister in.
It was back when they were like, Drown all the girls, and then they were like, Don't drown all the girls, but she was born on a drowning week, so, you know.
Joseph, this is the most fun I've had in a while.
Birds do it, bees do it, dinosaurs whom we live alongside do it.
Look, you're very sweet, but I have to save myself.
For who? There's only and you're related to half of them.
Look, I can't explain it, but something is telling me to wait.
Yeah, I know that girl-- that's Donna Magdalene, and her sister's a bigger slut than she is.
You know, we Jews got it right, working with our hands.
Yeah, let those eggheads in Rome do the brain work, we Jews will do the brawn work.
Hey, Italians, put a book down once in a while.
Hey, so, uh, you've been seeing that girl Mary for some time now.
She's gonna go down in history as Hot Bitch Mary.
Oh, I just thought I'd take a break from pooping in the open street to come see you.
I'll come by around that part of the day when the sun goes away and we're all terrified it will never come back.
I think I might hang out in the town square.
I hear an oracle from Greece is sending a funny message and I want to be there when it arrives.
Thanks, hey, listen I just got tickets to see Cher in Bethlehem.
But, look, Joseph, there's something I have to tell you.
Fear not, pretty lady who ain't never had no relations.
I's been sent to bring you the message that tonight you's gonna be getting pregnant with the Son of God.
Yeah, and it's gonna be here soon, so you might want to spruce yourself up.
Oh, and he probably don't want me to tell you this, but be ready 'cause he might give you a little bit of a donkey punch.
Well, if it his will, then his will be done, and I am but his humble servant.
I am here to show you how you lost your way.
Okay, hang on, I just got to use the bathroom.
Time to make our yearly terrible call to Great Aunt Helen.
Hi, Aunt Helen, it's Peter, Lois and the whole family.
We had quite a cold snap here. I hope you got our card.
Okay, nobody talk-- we'll just wait for her to talk.
Are you still there, dear? Well, we just wanted to...
Dad, can we hear more of that story about the baby Jesus?
Ah, right. Now everybody listen up while I stuff the rest of this rhetoric down your throats.
You know, when the baby comes, we could probably homeschool him.
Yeah, hey, so tell me one more time how it is that God got you pregnant.
'Cause when you tell me the story, it sorta makes sense.
But then when I tell the guys at work, they poke all kinds of holes in it.
I went there one time on a donkeys' night out.
And as Mary and Joseph made their way to Bethlehem, three wise men were preparing for a journey of their own.
Hey, you guys, this says a King of Kings will be born in Bethlehem, and we are to go and pay tribute.
Yeah, it's amazing how small the world is now thanks to mules and camels.
You can really tell we're in the big city now.
Meanwhile, the three wise men were making their way across the desert.
Hey, did you hear they're coming out with four more Commandments?
Uch, all that stuff does is interfere with small business.
Wow, look at that classy, Middle Eastern house with gold and marble.
People will always want to live next to big Middle Eastern houses with gold and marble.
We're on our way to Bethlehem to see a magic baby.
Magic baby? What's he do, card tricks, rabbit in the hat?
Would he let someone in the audience punch him in the stomach?
No, I'm not. Would a guy who feels threatened make sure all his advisors are shorter than him?
We won't leave the light on for you, because what, do I work for the electric company?
Yes, we were wondering if you had a room available?
Well, perhaps you have a room for my good friend fistful of sand.
But, sir, please, my wife is with child and about to give birth.
And I am with burrito and about to do the same.
Sir, if you don't leave now, I'm gonna have to call IX-I-I.
So, Joseph and Mary were turned away from the inn.
But, Dad, I still don't understand the whole Immaculate Conception thing.
Cleveland's got a cousin who had eight girlfriends get pregnant, and he says he's not responsible for a single one.
Good guy. You shake his hand, it feels like you're touching a nice briefcase.
I can't believe my baby's gonna be the Son of God.
Looks like all those years fighting off my own father's advances have finally paid off.
Oh, my God, you want him to get the crap beat out of him?
I'll run 'em up to God, and see if he picks one.
You want me to get y'all some wine and cheeses?
And that's why you're allowed to eat as much mozzarella as you want in any church.
So the three wise men set off again on their journey.
Hey, thanks for coming out on such late notice, Doc.
Oh, you don't have to thank me. This is a big deal.
It's not every day that God bestows a woman with his son.
And I brought you a breast pump, which in these times is just a guy.
Hey, if you're a virgin, how come I shot out of there like a greased-up cannonball?
Greetings! I have come to see the newborn king, but sadly, I bring no gift.
Well, then it looks like you got him a drum.
Also, I'm gonna start dieting and working out so I'm like crazy lean for the, you know, for, for, for the thing.
I may have a virgin mom, but I am one bad mother.
Ah! Ah! You guys get him! You guys get him!
Oh, my God! I just realized that's the same Jesus as the Jesus from church!
That's a beautiful story, Peter, about people coming together to form something greater than themselves.
Hi. We're from out of town and our car just broke down!
Couple of freaking scumbags working some scam, saying how they want to use our phone.
What?! Do they want all the presents under the tree, too?!
You're lucky it's Christmas or I'd call the cops on you dirty grifters!
Now you and your whore wife get out of here!
Okay, Mrs. Donovan. Following Mrs. Donovan by Chris Griffin. The first thing that Mrs. Donovan does when she gets home from school is put on sweatpants. Then she eats a whole tube of cookie dough, but she must be allergic to it because there are tears coming out of her eyes and she always throws up right after. Then she puts paper doll clothes on a picture of a sonogram.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I called you in today because your son, Chris, has been getting in quite a bit of trouble lately.
In fact, just yesterday, he tried to pass this drawing off as his Advanced Art project.
We have these cats that hang around the school, and we feed them.
Why doesn't Chris come in, and we can treat him like one of the cats?
And in a couple of years, we'll give him a diploma.
That doesn't sound like he'll be getting the best education.
Some of those cats go on to get pretty good jobs.
Breaking Bad is the best show you've ever seen, except maybe The Wire.
Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen, except maybe The Wire.
You will never stop talking about Breaking Bad or The Wire.
I will never stop talking about Breaking Bad or The Wire.
What the hell happened to all the smart genes in this family?
I mean, I invent the razor blade comb, and my kids are doing nothing.
I mean, when Chris grows up, will he even be able to get a job or take care of himself?
I feel awful saying it, but I'm kind of embarrassed by him sometimes.
I just wanted to listen to you guys have sex, but you were saying mean things about me.
We call her Chris so she doesn't know. you! Shut up, Chris!
Well, you know, Lois, it's never easy hearing the truth.
Oh, by the way, there's a baby in my preschool with HIV, and my teacher gave you something to sign to get him kicked out.
You know, Lois, if Chris is having confidence issues, they have camps for kids like him.
Well, they take kids who struggle in school and help them gain self-confidence in a nurturing environment.
If you're going to insult me again, just go away.
Look, honey, we're sorry, and we want to do something special for you.
This is a Hamilton Beach blender we got on our wedding day.
It keeps coming back to us in a vicious regifting cycle.
Well, Chris, camp is only as fun as you make it.
Don't suppose it would help to say I have a note from my doctor.
Space Camp. Spend a week doing intensive math and science, learning from real astronauts.
I'm sorry, that one must have accidentally gotten in with the rest of them.
What are you saying? That I'm too stupid for it?
Oh, honey, when we accepted those mugs, we knew this could happen.
You know, Chris, it's not too late to change your mind about Space Camp.
Sometimes it can be tough to fit in with a new group of people.
Yeah, I sure had my troubles when I got involved with the Boy Scouts.
At no time were the campers and Mr. Griffin naked simultaneously.
Well, regardless, on the way back, we're stopping at that Down syndrome camp we passed.
Hey, what's that? I thought all the space shuttles were decommissioned.
Well, we always keep one spacecraft flight-ready in the event a satellite needs service, there's a space station emergency or an Italian guy needs to overexaggerate.
I swear to God, Johnny, I've had it up to here with your BS.
That's a sensory deprivation room that prepares our astronauts for the terrifying emptiness of space.
Oh, and hey, if you get sent off on a space mission, um, don't be the black guy, 'cause you'll die.
I know you're going to have fun and make lots of good friends.
Yeah, and not fake friends, like guys whose wives are friends.
And you may want to brush up for tomorrow's lecture on orbital dynamics.
Oh, man. I don't belong here, and they know it.
Gentlemen, it has come to my attention that there's a Chinese among us.
Security is launching a full-scale investigation into the genealogy records of every single one of our employees.
This man will be found, and there will be dire consequences.
Campers, we are now in our state-of-the-art space shuttle simulator.
By the time you leave Space Camp, you will all be familiar with every device on board this craft.
I went to me barber at the shop, and I come out, I'm looking like this.
If you all saw Apollo 13, you know they had to fix an air scrubber with just the tools in the capsule.
Griffin, I need you to use these tools to fix my marriage.
All the kids are mean, and I keep messing everything up.
And there's this one guy who follows me around and calls me fat.
We spent thousands of dollars to send you here and made two trips to Florida in four days.
Well, I'm sorry, I thought I could handle it here, but I was wrong.
Yeah, remember when the fat man brought home that cougar chick?
Listen, just so there are no surprises, don't be scared-- my stuff looks like someone spilled an apple pie in my lap.
Well, I guess I did get to go on the space shuttle everyday.
I always wanted to be an astronaut like Lance Armstrong.
Look at this, Lois. a week ago, we call him stupid, and now he's giving tours of the space shuttle.
Well, I don't know what most of these buttons do, but I know this big red one is the one you press to launch.
No, thank you, I prefer to die giving you the finger.
If this is what it takes to get out of Florida, fine.
Yes, this is the best version of whatever's so enjoyable about this.
Oh, God, what if we have to live up here for the rest of our lives?
Yes, I'd like the chopped salad, please, and could I get no onions on that?
If there's one onion on that salad, you can forget the $1.80 tip you need to live.
I know you all must be pretty terrified right now, but we're doing everything in our power to get you safely back to earth.
We're pretty good at this-- we're like six for eight.
We just need some time to figure out your coordinates, and calculate the reentry plan.
So, just try to stay calm and we'll figure this all out.
Our top story, an accidental space shuttle launch that has sent a Rhode Island family into orbit.
For more on the story, we go to our local affiliate
Channel Five Quahog where Tom Tucker is on the scene.
Now I just need you to go ahead and reply.
I'm standing here at the home of the Griffin family, chatting with their neighbors.
You know, this is our one chance to experience the awe-inspiring wonders of space firsthand.
Aw, boy, I think this space food has gone bad.
'Cause mine's over there twirling in the air like a slow baton.
But guys to engage, we're gonna to take the shuttle out of...
If radio deejays have taught me anything about radio, it's that you got to do two things.
If we don't get this shuttle out of orbit soon, we're gonna run out of oxygen and die.
All right, come on, everyone, we got to put our heads together and try to find a solution.
Don't worry-- Griffins have a long history of figuring stuff out.
All right, come on, if mission control thought we could help get the shuttle out of orbit, it can't be that hard.
Hit up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
Oh, Meg, all your suicide threats over the years, and you're just as chicken  as the rest of us.
Hey, guys, I think I have an idea that could help us.
In Space Camp, we learned about countering forward momentum with retro rockets.
If we use them now, the ship might slow down enough for gravity to pull us out of orbit.
That's an egg that I hucked at you for being a nerd.
My book wasn't all I wanted it to be in spots!
I have to reorient the retro rockets to counter the spin rotation!
I can't believe I got to go to space before Derek Watson.
Well, thanks to no gravity in space, my spine stretched and I am now a confident six, three, so, Lois, I will be leaving you for a hotter woman.
Chris, our family is alive right now because of you.
Remember, kids-- if it's terrible, at the end, we all say, You did it!
I can't believe we're going to the theater the same day Chris drowned a mouse in a puddle.
I mean, don't we need a day to clear our heads?
You know, I was, uh... kind of one of those theater kids in high school.
Okay, we're here as friends, but I'm gonna change your mind one day.
It's hard to believe he's the same dog who barked at a pineapple for four hours.
I found this blazer on the side of the highway?
They didn't put masking tape over a seat for Tom Tucker and he's in there pitching a fit.
I make more in an hour than you make in two hours!
Mom, am I going to fit in the seat or is this going to be like last time?
King Louis the Sixteenth has been sentenced to death by guillotine.
The part of King Louis the Sixteenth will be played by Jean de Menard.
Well, as usual, this is gonna suck for one of us.
I got an audition for the hottest new play in town.
This could really make my career and we can finally start our family.
How did he do that? How did he do that?!
It's not too late. We can still start our family.
Oh, here it is. Here's hoping A Passing Fancy is actually a staying fancy. The highest praise goes to playwright Brian Griffin for his hilarious and insightful look into modern relationships. If you see only one play as an adult,
Hey, can you read that page with all the little paragraphs about dead people?
Mr. Beaker, it is my unfortunate task to inform you that your services will no longer be required by this company.
Well, if you must know, it's because we've noticed large quantities of benzene, ephedrine and everyday Epsom salt have gone missing.
We both know those are the ingredients used to make crystal meth.
And I've got a pretty good idea who you've been selling it to as well.
Oh, hey, uh, Beaker, when you're done talking to your friend,
Aw, boy, I wish I could hang out, but it has just gotten so crazy.
I mean, every performance is sold out and they just added a Wednesday matinee.
I mean, there's only one thing I'm not getting out of this experience.
Well, do you think you might have time to read it?
I mean, they're squeezing every last drop they can out of me, like a bottle of ketchup.
Two parts rain, one part sun, one part childlike wonder.
What we do know, though, is that the end result in both cases is joy.
Wow, are you glad you left the lighthouse now, Seamus?
Excuse me, I noticed you were talking loud, so that means you're smart.
But would you mind-- and I hate asking-- but would you mind signing this?
Jasper, I've never read anything like it in my life.
Ugh, that's how I feel whenever I see Brad Goreski on Bravo.
He gave it to me 'cause he wanted my feedback.
Do whatever you have to do, Brian, but never let him know he's got talent.
I replaced Peter's I Can't Believe It's Not Butter with real butter.
Looking back, I think it may have been real butter.
Your play has been nominated for a local Hoggy Award for Best Creative Anything.
Hey, so did you get a chance to read my play?
Yeah, I mean, I know you through our mutual friend Greg, but sure, I'd say we're friends now.
Exactly. And-and as your friend, you'd want me to be honest with you, right?
Oh, I know, I wanted it to be good so much.
I-I... Now I don't even know if I should submit it.
Yeah, I was planning to submit it to the Roundabout Theater Company in New York.
No, no, they won't let you down easy like I did.
Anyway, can I have that back? It's my only copy.
And thank you for being a good friend and telling me the truth, Brian.
He just pays me to watch him sleep and rub this knife across my face while I do it.
You know, Stewie, I have seen your play, and it is exhilarating to me.
A child's play is one of the most beautiful things in the world.
Really? 'Cause I had it sitting right on my table...
Well, that's interesting, Brian, because I found this buried in the backyard next to your soup bone.
Just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork of hackneyed ideas and tired clichés.
You have no idea how hard it was to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas.
Couldn't you tell something was up when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot?
I mean, it took Peter a year to figure out Stuart Little.
It's filled with terrible double entendres, puns and stolen bits.
May every person that laughs at your sophomoric effort be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity and pierce your heart like a knife.
I just found out that my play is going to be produced on Broadway.
Hey, I need you to take me to New York for the opening night of my play.
Besides, I checked, and there's no play by Stewie Griffin opening in New York.
I'm sure the New York Theater League would send a car.
Stewie, don't you think you're overdoing it with that outfit.
I don't wear anything I can't take off with a flourish.
Yes, and it seems to be quite a successful party.
Listen, I just want to say what an inspiration Glengarry Glen Ross was to me when I was writing my own play.
Boy, it's just so weird to be in a room where every single person in the room is a playwright.
We just went and saw a play in Quahog, Rhode Island.
We have this thing where we go to the worst regional theater we can find and laugh ourselves sick.
It's not like you were the only fat guy in there.
I was so happy until I read your play, Stewie.
I finally had some kind of success as a writer.
I was fine being an okay writer, until I discovered I was living in a house with a brilliant one.
I know we don't talk about doggy years a lot, but I-I just wish you could have waited to find out how talented you were until I was gone.
By the time I'm dead, you won't even be ten.
I just wish I could have had five to be good.
Listen, me and the other playwrights are going out to have drinks with Woody Allen and his daughter-wife.
They talked a lot more crap about you after you left.
I just wasn't as ready as I thought I was.
Geez, what the hell kind of stupid wallet is that, Joe?
Just don't throw it out within five miles of where we live.
Hey, why do you have a Harvard dining hall I.D.?
I pulled over some punk Harvard kid who gave me a bunch of lip, so I took his I.D.
Man, I bet they got fancy food up there at Harvard.
Or them lambs what ain't never seen the light before.
Hey, you know, we should drive up there and use that card to eat for free.
We'll be as out of place there as a black guy in Sweden.
Are we sure this is the way to the dining hall?
God, I'd love to be able to wheel around in a toy all day.
And just think, this is where Helen Keller used to eat when she went here.
Tonight, I want to go out and just get wasted.
I've been getting away with this since I was seven.
Lois, do you have any idea what I'm looking at right now?
I am at Harvard, the smartest school in the country, and they have...
Boy, breakfast for dinner is a real hot-button issue for you guys, huh?
She's also mad 'cause I shook Stewie and now he's walking weird.
Hey, was Beowulf a Teen Wolf sequel with Scott Baio? No.
Hey, you guys noticed how many Asians there are at this school?
I don't know. Guess that's just the way God made 'em.
Also, there'll be different varieties that will all hate each other for some reason.
Yeah, finally a terrible Boston bar with a giant low-def TV.
Hey, sometimes when daddies drive home drunk, they come from far away places, but it's okay because they didn't get arrested and they're still kind of drunk so they-they think it's okay.
You should know that Mom has emotionally let you go.
By the way, I need you to call my pimp and tell him I quit.
This is just what I've always wanted: to settle down, find a husband and live the married life.
How do I... how do I even know we're really married?
And it looks like I signed one of the witness lines and Peter partially signed the other.
You know, after 40 years in my line of work,
I've learned the difference between true love and doing the entire bowling team of a pizza restaurant on a box spring by a brook.
I might remember Charmese from a stag party in 1991.
Ask her if she remembers getting hit in the forehead with a meatball sandwich.
I got to go down to the courthouse right now and file for divorce.
Quahog has some extremely draconian laws governing divorce that all heavily favor the woman.
Well, to be honest, if you divorce her, she'll probably get everything you have.
Then I'll have to move into some depressing divorced guy apartment!
As you can see, we have plenty of cabinet space for your plate.
Sorry, Quagmire, but the only way around the law is if the woman consents to a divorce.
You heard her, the crazy skank wants to be a wife.
She's found herself a husband and she's not letting go.
I bet she's what happens if you put a Hooters girl in the microwave on high.
Well, the only other choice is to let her take all your money.
I guess I'm just gonna have to suck it up...
Let her suck it up-- she's the expert. Sorry, keep going. ...and at least try to make things work with Charmese.
After all, I liked her enough to marry her last night.
This year, in addition to the Hunger Games, we're going to do the Special Hunger Games.
So, Doc, I figured if Charmese and I are gonna live as man and wife,
Of course. Charmese, when's the last time you had a pelvic exam?
If I tug on the rope twice, that means pull me out.
God, who are the pigs who just throw their empty beer cans down here?
I found a lot of them on strung-out teenage corpses.
But I was thinking, maybe this afternoon you'd like to borrow my credit card and buy yourself a new wardrobe.
I would like to pawn all these clothes for crack money.
Gosh, thanks so much for having us over, you guys.
That chair with the garbage bag taped over it looks pretty good.
I was thinking of writing an article about you for my school paper.
They're supposedly putting an ice cream place where the shoe store was.
We've been married two weeks, and we haven't done it since that first night.
I haven't gone two weeks without sex since I was in a coma for six weeks.
Oh, God, please tell me I'm not married to some Nancy boy.
My dream is to live the married life and settle down.
Well, Charmese, I have something to tell you, and this isn't easy.
I was gonna make you breakfast maybe once a week, and give you stuff to do right when you walk through the door after work.
And I would've loved that, Charmese, if I just weren't so super duper double gay.
Hey, Ma, we got any pictures of me when I was a kid?
I'll send the divorce papers to that Rite Aid where you brush your teeth.
I told Charmese I was gay, and now she's gonna consent to a no-fault divorce.
I've been poisoned, and I'm trying to make myself throw up.
Damn it, Glenn, if you're not gay, then the divorce is off.
If you're really gay and you want that divorce, all you got to do is one thing.
I want to see you get it on with a guy.
If that's what it takes, I'll have sex with another man.
Teacher says every time a bell rings, some gay guy's gonna have sex with another gay guy.
And the Yew Nork Nankees bave heaten the Oltimore Borioles nive to foo here at Yamden Cards.
The Borioles now lace a fong toad rip where they'll face the Sed Rox, the Revil Days and the Jue Blays.
Listen, um, I need to ask you to do something, and it's something huge.
I mean, it's, like, the biggest thing a guy could ever ask his friend to do.
I would never ask you to do this if I had any other choice and if what were at stake was anything less than my entire way of life.
Charmese won't give me a divorce because she doesn't believe I'm gay, so I need you to have sex with me while she watches.
Peter, I can't imagine any scenario where this is gonna be beautiful.
You know, someplace fun, downtown, where the college kids go?
There's a whole man around it you have to please.
I'm tense because I have to bang you in 20 minutes!
Yes, and I cannot wait to intertwine our bodies and make each other's fingers smell terrible.
'cause I've been at full-sail for the last half hour.
I see that now, and the truth is, if you're willing to go this far to get a divorce, then maybe we shouldn't be married after all.
You were real nice to me, Glenn, nicer than any other guy's been, but I wanted to be somebody's wife, not somebody's burden.
I'm sorry my urine melted a hole through your toilet.
Hey, you know, there's not too many guys in the world who would be willing to do something like that for their pal.
No, no, you're an amazing friend, and I really owe you.
Valentine's Day: a day of love, right in the middle of Black History Month.
There are a thousand hearts in Quahog, a thousand stories.
I have dinner reservations and no one to go with.
Um, yeah, I'm just glad I didn't die from the weird sleep-breathing thing I have.
I was thinking let's do something we've never done before.
No, I was thinking we could spend the whole day in bed.
Permission to begin a day of epic lovemaking, sexy lady.
And if I need help, I'll just fantasize about that Victorian stripper.
Now, undo the top six buttons of your 100-button shoes.
Yeah, I totally hit it off with this great guy in the Internet, and we're finally going to meet.
Yeah, that's a candid from a summer job I had.
But, I guess every girl has her own version of Prince Charming.
Sounded like you said you were in love with Ringo.
One of these days, you're going to get what you deserve.
Why do I look like a chick in that mirror?
You probably just had one too many drinks last night.
God, I thought I was in trouble for a minute.
Well, how would you like to spend four hours desperately trying to give me a muscular soldier?
In fact, as I say to all the ladies, giggity-giggity.
I thought why not go back in time to that summer of love in the '60s that everyone's always talking about.
Hey, you think you might be able to get me some acid?
I'll get you rolled-up newspaper on the snout is what I'll get you.
Rupert, I must bring her back to the present and raise her to be my wife.
Oh, hey, um, I just came to say, um... you know, in a couple of years something's going to come along called Sesame Street.
And I know the name makes it sounds Asian, but it's not, and it's going to blow your mind.
You can crawl around on the floor while I drink, smoke, and drive us home.
God, Toby, I can't believe how much we have in common.
Meg, if you were any more beautiful, that'd be neat.
Black market organs are big money and I promised my bosses a fresh kidney.
By the way, did you know you had a tiny conjoined twin attached to your hip?
Oh, Quagmire loaned me this book called the Kama Sutra.
And who has better sex than people who don't use toilet paper?
Peter, these candles are getting wax all over the floor.
You can shoot a Mexican for using a water fountain.
Oh, hey, um, I think I might have the wrong address.
Hope cupid brings you a saggy old bag of treats.
Hey, Mr. Herbert, I'm just here to collect for the newspaper.
I'd love to talk to him, but I just don't know what I would say.
To Catch a Predator Who's Proud of Being a Predator.
Do you know the boy you were coming here to meet tonight is only 13 years old?
All right, sweetie, let me just spit on my hand, and we'll get started.
This is the universe giving me what I deserve for being such a pig all the time!
Men are jerks! Let's swear off of them and find comfort in each other!
How come it's so hard to meet the right woman?
I think maybe it's just time for me to give up.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Despite our best efforts, the Texas School Book Depository Awareness Council has failed in its mission to generate public awareness of the Texas School Book Depository.
So at the end of the day, we'll be shutting down operations and laying everyone off.
Still, we can try to make a go of it
Look, I've been thinking about your situation with women, and I believe I've come up with a way to get to the source of the problem. Follow me.
Well, I thought they could provide some insights that might improve your love life.
Ladies, as you may have guessed, you are here because you have all dated this great guy.
Oh, come on! You're all just mad because I didn't wanna be with you!
He's just having a difficult time coming to terms with his own sexuality.
You still have bits of penis left, and you can never get wet.
And you, you're more of a woman than anyone else in this room!
Oh, honey, I'm so excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
I don't know why I didn't do this years ago.
What do you want me to do with the body?
Oh, come on. You would have been a great mom.
She's basically a boob on a leg at this point.
What? Well, I didn't even know the Fine Young Cannibals were still together.
Well, I don't know if I can make eight, but I can certainly do six.
And now I want you to go and take a picture of yourself because it will be your last day alone.
By the way, my attendance at home is gonna be spotty over the next few weeks.
And, well, prize pumpkin from the county fair, that's why I'm naming you my Chief of Police.
I trust you'll take care of things here in my absence.
I hereby declare this public park and future homosexual meeting spot... open!
Well, well, well, if it isn't Mayor Guns For Toys West.
Carol, I love you and I can't live without you.
Hey-ey, Carol. I almost didn't recognize you without my special sauce all over your face.
You say, Chris, I wanted to come see you because, well...
Now, I know I'm not much to look at, and ever since I got banned from the arcade,
Also, if I gave you a sandwich, do you think you could get Chris to fart on it?
No, she just doesn't want other people to have them for some reason.
Oh, Peter, it was fun spending the day in bed with you.
Who was that half-Persian chick who was dancing with your cousin?
What? Shut up for ten minutes and pretend we're in the back behind the speakers.
E is even more than anyone that you adore can
All right, class, today we're going to be talking about variables.
Um, I'm not sure, but my mom says they're very popular with Latvian athletes.
Last year it was all about being overweight and wearing a baseball cap.
Hey, guys, sure hope we win the big game on Saturday.
Oh, of all the years to be trim and well-hatted.
You take me in your arms Oh, isn't that cute?
It's like her voice is putting my entire body in her mouth.
This must be what it's like for you when you're buying potatoes or scraping your heels or smushing on makeup for a sad night out.
This portion of the Channel 5 News at 6:00 is brought to you buy condoms.
Put us on backwards a little bit, then put us on the right way.
When I was your age, I didn't even have sneakers.
Yeah, I even had to take a second job as a door-to-door vacuum salesman.
I'll pour some wine, rub in some feces, and, to top it off, some mustard mixed with feces.
All right, Rupert, you ready to get lost in some Anne?
And if I could, you know that I would fly away with you
Yeah, if I could, you know that I would fly-i-i-i-i
To think Canada's got her, and we have Kelly Clarkson going to town at a Waffle House.
Just a bunch of cards that say, I farted on your car, with his insurance info.
Geez, it's so weird that Mom and Dad would leave the house without their purse and wallet.
I'm at my date and I left my wallet at home.
Will you please borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet, and bring it back here?
And that was the last we ever saw of him.
How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say.
Here's a list of stuff I need you to do for me.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
They're so much better than regular bars because worse is better.
It seems like we would be perfect for each other.
Yeah, neither does a soft summer breeze, or a letter from an old friend.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm going to make a believer out of you, Brian.
I am going to show you the true meaning of Anne Murray.
Don't waste your time, I'm not going to change my mind.
I don't know, Bri, I can make things happen when I want to.
Okay, Meg, I've cleaned your room and I did your homework.
At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card.
Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me.
Wow, thank you for turning me on to something so amazing.
And I'm sure Buzz Lightyear would have enjoyed it if he had bothered to show up.
Hey, how would you like to go to my apartment... and beyond?
Planned Parenthood for 36 hours and here are the pictures of every girl in your class who went in.
Now I want you to call them as if you're their dead baby.
No way, that was the last thing on your list.
Well, you should've thought of that before you stole money out of Mom's purse.
I need you to go downtown and get the stuff from my P.O. box.
No, I get a lot of private correspondence from the Netherlands.
Like, I'm part of a group that kind of trashes Anne Frank's house every year.
I'm not-I'm not doing any more of your crap, Meg.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
I'm going to run away and no one will ever see me again.
I want to pinch myself to see if I'm dreaming.
Well, I suppose it's about trying new things; sampling the sweet and the savory; not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
But don't you think it's scary to try new things?
At first you think you're never going to get a ball in there.
But then you oil it up, work your fingers around in there a little, and pretty soon you're pitching and catching.
You really know how to waste a Cialis, don't you?
You know, this is definitely a mystery song for me.
I'm-I'm sorry, are we both listening to Snowbird, as recorded by Miss Anne Murray?
Yeah, the woman in the song is trying to cope with getting older and she feels trapped because she knows she can't do anything about it.
I mean, you're right that she's feeling trapped, but the message is positive.
It's about being trapped in a bad relationship and having the guts to get out of it.
No, no. See, what I hear, is that the woman is starting to hate life.
You know the line, Now I feel such emptiness within?
And then, to make things worse, the snowbird comes around every year, bringing the snow, or death, to remind her that no matter what she does, her fate's already written.
Brian, the snowbird has nothing to do with time or fate.
Only the artist knows the true meaning of their art.
Now, Ms. O'Keefe, the flowers in your paintings, what do they represent?
He, um, said something about a fat kid rally at Little Caesars.
We were supposed to go to the library to wipe boogers in fancy books.
It's like a time bomb to gross out lonely chicks.
I was trying to find a good movie to watch.
I've never even heard of most of these. Jeffrey at the Park. Mikey's Scoliosis Exam. Nephew Somersault Compilation.
You want to explain to me how Sammy Popsicle comes before Napping, Various?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, why do you get to ring it?
Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am.
Wow, nothing says success like free on a Tuesday at 3:00 p.m.
So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about Snowbird.
No, no, it's obviously about the fear of growing old.
I guess I always thought it was about human limitation, both mental and physical.
Hey, uh, before we go, do you mind if I use your restroom?
I thought they said topless, so I was like, what?
Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what Snowbird was about.
But I suppose Gene probably could have explained it better than I.
No, all of my songs were written by other people.
As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters.
Well, so, that's the case with a lot of singers.
Well, then you're all a bunch of frauds, aren't you?
You know it. You didn't write it, but you know it, bitch.
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you.
Uh, I haven't seen him but I'll keep an eye out.
I thought I told you to clean up in here?
We're supposed to have dinner with Judge Maynard and Timmy.
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
Chris, I... I think it's time for you to go.
Why? You want to humiliate me with more slave work?
I said a lot of stupid things I didn't mean, Chris.
You know, living in that family, we both have pretty crappy lives.
And if we're going to survive it, we can't turn on each other.
Oh, looks an awful lot like the Governor's Mansion from Benson.
It is. I'm fond of the series, and I wanted the local birds to be aware of that.
Well, actually, Lois, that's a species of bird that's known to frequent domestic birdhouses.
Hey, Lois, let's go outside and see if we can find some great tits.
Yeah, and-and the bigger one had a hair sticking out of that pointy thing.
Maybe we can get the birds to act out the Benson where a scheduling snafu forces the governor to decide between meeting the president or going to Katie's school play!
I just hope whoever moves in doesn't mind the Persian birds next door.
Indeed, a force to be reckoned with, like Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.
Secretary Chu, Ways and Means has sent over a preliminary budget.
It looks like the Department of Energy is looking at a four-percent budget cut.
Yeah, Peter, get rid of that thing right now and eat your dinner.
I am a falconer and I will eat whatever Xerxes brings me.
Hey, what do you got going on down there, Quagmire?
Well, just hope he's not standing on your soft spot.
I represent the man whose sidecar motorcycle you stole yesterday.
Unfortunately for you, that man is very, very Jewish and is suing you for everything you've got.
Oh, thank God. Thought I was gonna have to go back to being on Live with Kelly and Peter.
So exhausting having to do that open-mouth smile while the guest does their bit.
So, Christine, you've actually won an Emmy, is that right?
But my character on The Good Wife is such a complete departure from Maryann.
Excuse me, would you mind taking a look at my résumé?
I haven't had an interview in a while, and I want to make sure it's formatted correctly.
I can get you steady work with a voice like that.
Now I won't have to become a Mary Kay saleswoman.
So, what makes these shampoos different from the ones at the supermarket?
I could be one of those famous voice-over artists you hear on TV or in the movies.
Maybe she could be one of those annoying voices that goes, Ah, ah, ah, not that product.
Which of these leading brands of canned soup has less than a hundred grams of sodium?
I might hit someone with my car on the way home just for kicks.
Well, I have a feeling you're gonna be a big star here.
And whatever you do, do not mention computers or the Internet.
Listen, I want to double-team you on the phone with my son.
And I'm just, uh... just a dad trying to keep it all together.
You know, I have got to get myself back out there, too.
I want you to take the money out and count it really slowly.
I'm sorry, the next bill I have in here is a ten.
Good, ball that up and stick it in your mouth.
Okay, why don't you go ahead and stick that in your mouth, too.
Yeah, go ahead and roll that up and stuff it in there.
Did you get a packet from HR when you started working there?
And I'm pretty certain you know what I want you to do with it.
Okay, you think you can fit anything else in your mouth?
Mm-mm. All right, so now let's start filling up some other places.
Peter, I've had a long day at work, and right now, sex is the last thing I want to think about.
What if I told you I'm holding in a very big dump?
Hey, Joe, how often do you have sex with Bonnie?
Well, my HMO only pays for the equipment once a year. Why?
Joe, you telling me not to has no effect on me whatsoever.
I mean it, you guys, this no-sex thing doesn't work.
You know, Peter, I got just the thing for you.
There's this new phone sex chick I been calling, and she is amazing.
Hey, I was right about telling you to go see the gynecologist, wasn't I?
They call me that 'cause I got a big twist at the end of my thing.
Um, you want to see some pictures that I drew?
It was just in my imagination, so I drawed it.
It makes me want to hear more of your voice.
He's scared 'cause his friends got killed in the pie.
Listen, um, I've had such a good time talking to you these past few times that I was thinking maybe we could meet.
Yeah, but she's been giving me the cold shoulder lately.
I mean, cheating on your wife is a very serious thing.
I-I know it seems sudden, but I feel a special connection with you.
Look, you name the place and the time, and I'll be there.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting Fairy God Quagmire and Fairy God Joe down at the Fairy God Clam.
That sounds like a gay bar. It is a gay bar.
Oh, I-I thought we were starting in the middle to save time.
You never want to meet those phone sex women in person.
Joe, Joe, you realize what you're telling me not to do, I'm already not doing!
Okay, I know you should never meet a phone sex operator.
Guys, I have to see if she's as special in person as she is on the phone.
I never would've got that job as a seat filler for fetuses.
Okay, let's take a look at your baby, shall we?
So, as far as Peter knows, he's about to cheat on you?
There's a lot of crazy things I'll let Peter get away with.
I even held my tongue when he went through that anime phase.
Hey, Lois, me make drive time to super fun Clam with noble Quagmire and wheel-monster Joe.
All right, I got to say good-bye to the kids.
It still works, even though it's got a lot of Civil War brains all over it.
Chris, people are gonna tell you that you're stupid and that you're no good.
I am not, in fact, the President of Hot Wheels.
You know, I got the greatest wife in the world.
You know, something you had once, but now it's gone?
Yeah, I mean, I was just goofing around when I first called you, but when I heard your voice,
I-I felt like I found some part of me that was lost.
Doesn't make any sense, but it... it felt like some force in the universe wanted us together.
I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You-you-you-you is the phone lady, you the phone, you the phone, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady...
I'm starting to think that whole Chicago City business trip was just a bunch of baloney!
You know, when I heard your voice on that phone,
Both my heart and my wiener somehow knew you were my soul mate.
And, look, now we just had the best sex in years because of it.
I know. It's like our privates were shaking hands after a successful business meeting in a swamp.
To me it... it just proves that we're truly meant to be together.
By the way, you may have to become a full-on prostitute,
I want you to do me so hard that we have to change churches.
I want to wreck you so bad, you'll look like an exploded Hot Pocket.
We now return to Jeopardy Presents: The Best of Contestant Banter.
So, Ben, it says here you have a connection to milk.
Yes, funny story. I discovered recently that I have an allergy to milk.
So I guess we won't be eating any cheese around you.
And Dennis, you once spent a night in a tent?
So, uh, what do you guys got planned for the weekend?
I don't know. I might sit out in the front yard with a rake and wave at cars.
Maybe it's time the three of us do something exciting to shake things up.
One that I think is awesome, and one that I think is stupid.
We could either A) Rob a Mafia poker game, or B) Skydive.
Besides, I haven't done anything new since I learned to use a palm frond.
And do we stagger our waves or do 'em at the same time?
Yeah, I got one. Can I listen to my iPod on the way down?
Of course. Just as long as it's not Tom Petty's Free Fallin'.
Yeah. It said in the brochure that he assists with all the jumps.
Uh, Peter, I think that's just a piece of paper.
Hey, guys, let's try to re-create this feeling for the rest of our lives, with drugs.
Oh, it looks like it's almost time for us to pull our cords.
I haven't felt a rush like this since I won that marathon!
I'm Bob Costas, here with Boston Marathon winner Peter Griffin.
And when there was a guy in my way, I killed him.
All right, it's 4:59. In just a few seconds, all the unreturned library books will be officially late.
The wieners was already drawed in the books when I got 'em. Libra: A strange man will drop into your life. Hmm. Pisces: Be careful at work today.
Oh, so now I got you a bad washing machine for Christmas.
I write down all his advice in a little notebook.
Yesterday's was, I've never seen a pigeon die from eating food on the ground, so what's the big whoop?
It's like they say, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and gay guys gotta criticize the host of the party behind his back.
I know. And remind me to get the recipe for those chopped-up hot dogs.
Oh, thanks! I'm so glad you guys could make it!
Actually puts me in the mind to write a spoken word poem.
O, Great Spirit, free me from the bonds of gravity and criticism.
O, Great Spirit, why do I hold myself back in such situa...?
Hey, look at that douchebag who got stabbed in the butt!
Well, Peter, I'm glad you're all right, but I hope this is the end of your skydiving career.
I saw my whole life flash before my eyes, and we did way too much Star Wars crap.
I should get the kids home. It's way past dinner.
What she really means is that it's shaky Mommy's white wine time.
Let's go, kids! Come on! We really gotta go, kids.
Excuse me. Now that your family is gone, would you mind if we turn on the TV?
I, uh, I was just kidding when I told my family I loved 'em.
I'm Peter. You know, I never seen a hat like that before, so I'm very scared of it.
Oh. Hey, you know who'd look funny wearing one of those?
Well, if you turn on Channel 14, we can probably catch the end of Muslim Looney Tunes.
As a pig, I am very dirty and should not be touched by humans.
They have this one jar, whole thing was full of cotton balls.
Joe is, uh... chattier than you'd think he'd be when you're not here.
Look, I'm just saying if pro is the opposite of con, what is the opposite of progress?
You know, I actually had a pretty good time in the hospital.
In fact, I told him to swing by if he had time.
Oh, hey! You made it! Hey, guys, this is Mahmoud.
Oh, but I do not pay attention to such things.
You know progress has the word pro in it, right?
Hey, you guys, come on. Let's get the man a drink.
But if you'll excuse me, right now I have to go bring great shame to myself by using the restroom.
Yeah, and he's got his cell phone clipped to his belt like he's some kind of big shot on vacation.
I, for one, think it's great that Peter has enough of an open mind to have a Muslim friend.
You know, a lot of dogs just sit outside, tied to poles.
Irish guys drink a lot, black guys change their shirts while they tell you a story.
She's taking interior design classes down at the community college.
But I guess now she wants to hang plates on the wall or whatever.
And you know she gained the weight back from the Lap-Band, right?
Okay, I'm gonna go eat this steak in the bathroom.
It's like ear-bloodening sounds had sex with nose-bloodening smells and this is their baby.
It's a chicken that has been yelled at for two hours and then run over by a Mercedes.
You know, Peter, a lot of people are not as accepting of Muslim culture as you are.
I mean, who doesn't want to sit around a table with a bunch of guys and suck on the same thing?
Man, I wish I could stay here all night, Mahmoud.
But I'm supposed to pick up the dry cleaning before it closes.
I need you to run an errand for my friend Peter.
Sweet hat, obedient wife, and I get to shout Admiral Akbar when I do stuff?
Well, Lois, I happen to be a Muslim now, which means I'll be spending a lot of my time in mostly-empty cafes, watching soccer on an eight-inch black-and-white TV.
Oh no! The team I don't like is kicking it!
Hey, is that for real, that-that Diarrhea Only sign on your bathroom?
He can teach you many things about our faith, including how to ululate.
Just sing the beginning of La Bamba, but don't say the La Bamba part.
Well, if you're going to the market, can you pick up some cereal, some butter, and a loaf of bread?
Here's six cobras, a bolt of silk, and a ram's horn.
Hey, can you help me with the 20 paper bags of dates I got in the car?
Why the hell would you get 20 bags of dates?
The monkey in the little vest who was selling them happened to be very persuasive.
I'm just gonna assume this will pass, like your everywhere is a racquetball court phase.
So, Mike, now that you've thoroughly kicked my butt all over the court, what do you say we take one quick second to talk about the Wichita account?
And let me assure you, my racquetball game is no indication of how we do business here at J.T. Stern.
I am impressed by how much you have committed yourself to Islam.
Listen, Peter, some friends of mine and I are getting together tonight and we wanted to invite you to join us.
Hey, is anyone gonna object if I pick my nose with a dagger?
Look at him, he is the perfect man to help us blow up the Quahog Bridge.
Mahmoud says we all need to act like we're fans of American football so we seem less... b-buh... buhspicious.
Did you know he knew 19 guys who died on 9/11?
Look, I'm gonna call Mahmoud right now on this cell phone he gave me.
Just because these few guys are terrorists doesn't mean all Muslims are.
We have the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, and even that fat guy at the Atlanta Olympics who didn't do it, but he looked mean, so we said he did.
Joe, you don't get to talk about the regular Olympics.
Well, I gotta go down there right now and tell Mahmoud we can't be friends anymore.
If you can find out what they're planning next, we might actually be able to stop an act of terror.
Remember how upset I seemed to get when Lois said she was leaving town with the kids for a few days?
Oh, my God, I'm gonna miss you guys so much.
Don't forget to call and let me know exactly when you'll be back.
Remember, we'll be in the van listening to everything, so if anything goes wrong, we'll pull you right out of there.
I'll blend in like a chameleon in Courtney Love's crotch.
We loaded a van with explosives, which we will drive to the bridge and...
In order to get past the checkpoint at the toll plaza, we will need an American behind the wheel to arouse the least amount of suspicion.
Look, I know you're mad at our government, but you gotta realize, that's only part of America.
We're the land of the free and the home of the sunburnt, freckled fat guy.
A place where Jenny McCarthy has a role in the debate over childhood vaccinations.
A country where you can walk into any IHOP and see black women fighting.
And where Ubu is considered a good dog even though he never sat.
We're the proud nation where someone can shoot up their entire workplace with a thing, and then the next day nobody talks about banning that thing.
It's the land that lets people on Twitter spell the word their any way they want.
And where, if you think you can dance, that assertion will be challenged and evaluated.
Thanks to you, 30 terrorists are behind bars, and every middle-class Arab in this town is now under suspicion.
So what happens next, do those guys all get trials?
Well, what do you guys say we all go celebrate at the Clam?
An aide to Mayor Adam West has been found stabbed to death at the mayor's mansion.
Police say the victim was killed by a knife belonging to the mayor, who is considered the prime suspect at this time.
Also found in the mayor's residence was a blackmail note from the victim threatening to expose the mayor in a corruption scandal unless the victim was paid off.
You can put a picture of a note above my shoulder any time now, Tony.
We now go live to Tricia Takanawa, who is outside the mayor's mansion.
Tom, I'm standing outside the mayor's mansion, where, against the wishes of his attorneys, the mayor has agreed to an impromptu press conference.
Yes, I'll take a question from the reporter from the Quahog Elementary School Gazette.
I thought we had an understanding that the dark was off limits.
And now I will have my normal post-news review from my mom in her car.
I always knew Mayor West was a little crazy, but I never thought he was capable of something like this.
Oh, you know, it's like you can already hear them.
Brian, all I have to do is start fake sneezing around you and you'll spend the rest of your life outside.
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can hear some of the jokes.
Well, I guess you just never know what kind of rage some people have bottled up.
The important thing is finding a healthy way to channel it.
Until I'm not angry anymore, you naked bunch of bitches!
In closing, although it seems pretty clear that my client committed this murder,
I would consider it a personal favor to me if you found him not guilty.
Jurors, you have now heard all the facts of this case.
I remind you that because we are a small town, many of you may have ties with the defendant or the victim.
You must set aside these personal connections and render an impartial and unanimous verdict.
Well, Meg, life isn't always as simple as what they teach you at school.
Now I'm gonna take the casserole out of the oven.
And don't try to stand between me and your father; it'll just make it worse.
So I's been asked by the judge to be the foreman, and I want y'all to know that we's gonna run a fair jury and a clean jury, so I brought some wet naps for everyone to wipe off their areas.
'Cause one of us gets sick, we's all gonna get sick.
And that may lead to some of us getting sicker than others.
Joyce will anchor the news, and I don't think anyone wants that to happen again.
Now let's just vote him guilty and get out of here.
Look, I know everyone's in a hurry, but shouldn't we at least go over the evidence once before we vote, just to be fair?
You know what would shed some light on th case?
If we huck water balloons at people in the street.
Here's the facts: there was a note from the victim, threatening to expose the mayor in a corruption scandal.
And finally, that lady with the Peter Gallagher eyebrows on the witness stand saw the whole thing.
All right, looks like we's gonna be here a while.
Look, the system specifies the defendant must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Well, was Mayor West the only one with a motive?
I mean, there are people who would benefit if he were put away for murder.
Was a movie with Jennifer Lopez that did not live up to expectations.
Well, Mayor West did say he never saw the letter.
John F. Kennedy swore he'd serve a full four-year term.
Look, we should be sticking to the facts, not stereotypes.
It's unfair to say that all politicians are liars, therefore Mayor West is guilty.
I was a county alderman once and I never told no fibs.
It's important to make sure everyone is happy, so I took a lot of polls.
He spits whenever he makes the ch noise, which, in this language, happens a lot.
I'm expected to entertain him and his wife tonight, so if anyone knows a good restaurant in the area...
Sushi or tapas, something where they're always bringing stuff to the table so you have something to talk about.
Look, an expert confirmed that the blackmail note was signed by the victim.
Well, maybe we should take a look at that letter.
Mr. Bailiff, we request that you bring us the note from the victim.
Hey, Bailiff, can I talk to you for a second in this broom closet?
I can't wait to hear what this is all about.
Yeah, are you trying to suggest that Mayor West's enemy faked a corruption letter and then killed himself?
You know, something bothered me about the stationery that note was on, with the-the decorative M border.
No, no, I'm pretty sure the M is for Marriott.
How do you know? Because I once got a note from the Marriott written on the same paper. Dear Brian. You were amazing last night.
This is from the night you had sex with Quagmire's dad.
I did a dog once, but I was in the Philippines, and I sure as hell didn't write him a letter.
The victim had access to all the Office of the Mayor stationery he could ever want, yet he hand-made a letterhead on stationery from a Marriott?
Look, you guys just say the word and I'll put this ball with cheese in it on the floor.
We won't hear from him for an hour and a half.
Look, if I'm still the only one who says not guilty,
I'll change my vote and we can all go home.
Okay, everyone take one of these here and write their vote.
I'm starting to think all you do is dick around.
Some hurtful slurs followed by the word guilty. Guilty, guilty. El guilto. Guilty, guilty.
Look, we have been cooped up in this room for five hours now.
I'm starting to feel like an animal in a cage.
Oh, he couldn't masturbate because his arms are too short
Luckily he found a wife so he could have sex
Okay, look, tempers are starting to get a little heated, so why don't we all go take us a little potty break?
Now you're all gonna have to witness me taking an old-man pill that looks way too big to swallow.
I get very sad on Sundays when you're not here.
I feel like I'm rooting around a pitcher of sangria.
Oh, no, I didn't roll my sleeve up far enough.
Oh, why didn't I flush when I got in here?
Aah, why didn't I use the hand that was on the floor?!
Even if you don't believe the note was legitimate, there was an eyewitness who saw the entire thing.
Now, how could a woman at an orgy witness a murder?
But still, I don't see how she could look out a window and witness a crime.
Trust me, you're banging eight strangers who responded to a flyer, at some point you're gonna look out a window and question every decision you've ever made.
You're gonna want to feel the heat coming off him.
And we're probably partway into it here, so one of your eyes is stuck shut.
All the way shut-- there are 11 of us, dear.
Carl, you can take your fist out of your own mouth.
Thanks, it's okay to look the other way when y'all pass me on the street with y'all's wives.
And that places the witness right here, next to the lubricating station and the terrible smelling guest book.
Okay, y'all, so we's now at six guilty, six not guilty.
So we's all gonna have to stay here until we's unanimous in our verdict.
Well, so what if that woman at the orgy couldn't see?
Yeah, let's wrap this up-- I got the director's cut of Raiders of the Lost Ark waiting for me at home.
Prancing around with his naked lip out for all the world to see.
But you know what I mean-- they're all over the place.
Okay, the majority of this room now believes that there is reasonable doubt about Mayor West's guilt.
Now I'd really like to hear from the holdouts because a man's life hangs in the bal...
Do you guys mind if I struggle to open these blinds?
Carter, you're the only person who still thinks he's guilty.
There was a dead guy found in Mayor West's home.
And the police detective who examined all the evidence named him the prime suspect.
The jury is instructed to disregard the witness' last remark.
None of this stuff's ever gonna apply to my real life.
I'm just gonna go work in the mines anyway like my dad.
How would you like to stay for an hour after the trial?
Guys, I feel like all we talk about is Mayor West.
And all I wanted was to fire a missile into a fault line to sink half of Quahog into the ocean and make my real estate waterfront.
I even let him marry my daughter Carol, damn it.
It wasn't that aide that got stabbed in the back, it was me!
And we've witnessed the power of the greatest justice system in all the world.
Now that you've been acquitted, what does the future hold for Mayor Adam West?
And I know this is real because you're not rabbit-people.
You both did your civic duty and you saved Mayor West.
Yeah, I mean, it was a pretty intense experience, but the important thing is, in the end, justice was served.
And that's something to feel good about. Feel good about?
It was awfully nice of our new neighbors to invite us over for dinner.
Going to Cleveland's house with someone else living there just seems weird.
Hi, I don't know who to complain to about this, but I'm still getting XVIII's mail.
Oh yeah, no, yeah, we'll-we'll hang on to Boys' Life.
They're selling a biopsy of Celine Dion's uterus on eBay.
I'm over here with Joe, and he's got a space alien.
Ugh, damn it, I always wake up before I find out if they can understand the baby.
Thanks for helping me set up this jungle gym, guys.
All right, I got the monkey bars all put together.
Aw, God, look at that, they already got Al Qaedas all over them.
Man, they're gonna be so good at swinging bar-to-bar, when they invade.
Wow, Quagmire, how did you build that part so fast?
No, I just read the back, where it's printed in French.
Yeah, and French also comes in handy when I have layovers in Montreal.
I always wanted to go to Canada, but then South Park went, so we couldn't go.
And they all play ice hockey, so they lose their teeth by age ten.
In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that a Canadian strip club is the most magical place in the world.
But I don't want to get any crap from your wives about me taking you to a strip joint.
So you guys are gonna have to lie about where we're going.
We now return to Stabbed in the Butt, the only game show where if you get the answer wrong, you get stabbed in the butt.
Hey, do I give you the third degree every time you go for one of those luxurious mammograms?
Because somebody's got to stay here and round up all these rattlesnakes.
Well, let's just say I walked in on John Travolta with not Kelly Preston.
I've got a lot of big ideas, too, but everybody's just so jealous.
They even got a special map that lets you choose who you wan to dump your poop on.
Oh, my God, Joe, there's a man on the wing.
Hang on, you guys; I don't know if I can pull out of this-- giggity!
Wow, from up here, everything looks so huge and coming faster.
Still, you know, we saved so much trouble not flying commercial, I think we came out ahead.
If we went to Logan, that plane wouldn't crash for another hour, at least.
Okay, I know you're a pilot and everything, but not everyone likes to talk about planes as much as you, Quagmire.
Well, we're out of cell phone range and the radio's shot.
No one knows we're out here, and we've got no food or water.
The trick is just knowing what's safe to eat and what's not.
You guys, I think, for the time being, we're gonna have to start thinking in terms of survival.
Yeah, we're just gonna have to do what Davy Crockett would do.
I mean, that guy killed a bear when he was only three.
Honey, don't you think it's weird that our three-year-old son is murdering animals?
So I could have this cool hat and 'cause it felt like heaven when I was doing it.
Hey, do you think there's directions about starting fires in the song We Didn't Start the Fire?
If it rains, at least we know we can stay dry.
So, now our number one concern is that Predators are watching our body heat.
No, I think we need to cover ourselves in mud to avoid being seen.
We should not rule out the Predator having been the farter.
Okay, we still got nothing to eat, so it looks like we're gonna have to hunt animals for food.
Listen, I wish you had a family to take care of you, too, but that's a choice you made.
First time in a while I've had wood in my lap.
You guys, we've been out here a couple days now, and I don't think anyone's coming to get us.
It might be time for one of us to go for help.
You want me to just walk out there, straight into the woods?
Peter, if you don't, the only other option is we sit here and wait to die.
Well, I hate to ask you this, Quagmire, but do you know how to change a diaper?
Yeah, of course I know how to change a diaper.
He has to do it 'cause his wife has the job.
Yeah, what are... what are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere?!
What?! A plane crashes in your backyard, and you don't say anything?!
I thought it might be rude to intrude on your plane crash.
Listen, why don't we head back to my place, grab a bite to eat and watch the big curling match on TV?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
There's nothing in that direction but wilderness for thousands of kilometers.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, there's been no sign of your husband for two months.
Most black men don't possess the skills to survive out here in the wilderness.
Well, then, we need to regroup because... we haven't been looking.
Wait! We may have a possible lead on Peter Griffin!
And there's some scribbling on the back that says, Mrs. G.
Dad gets lost in the woods, and he makes a doll?
It looks like he's become some kind of feral beast.
How could Dad turn into some kind of feral creature just from two months in the wilderness?
Well, he was living among wild animals for two months, and you know how impressionable your dad can be.
You guys, this is gonna be harder than we thought.
I guess we're all just gonna have to work together to reintroduce your father to civilized society.
But it can't be any harder than folding that thousand-mile-long sheet.
You know, long ago, before this happened, your father did make some videos in case he ever became feral.
If you're listening to this, you've probably become feral, and you're probably thinking of a nice juicy rabbit right now.
Okay, good. So, feral Peter, why don't you put in tape number two and let's get started.
Don't listen to that Peter! That Peter is a liar!
All right, now, I've been trying to figure out something we can do together, and I think I've found it.
Now, I'll start, and when I point to you, you'll sing your part. Ready?
We just thought we'd come by and see how Peter was doing.
We've tried everything to bring the old Peter back, but we can't break through to him.
Hard as it is to admit, it might be time to let Peter be where he belongs.
We might have to release Peter back into the wild.
Someone from my past, and, well, long story short, go, go, Guatemalan son.
Peter, we all love you very much, but we think maybe this is where you belong and where you'll be happy.
Whatever adventures lie ahead of you, know that my heart will always be with you.
We will never forget you, but you're better off here.
I love you, Dad, and no matter where you are, you'll always be my father.
And luckily, I don't know many words, so I was able to relearn them all in a day.
He said he's put together a very special surprise, just for me.
Mesdames et monsieurs, all the way from America, please welcome
I just threw up two chicken gyros out my nose.
But I want you to keep talking to me in that sexy voice while we do it.
Okay great. Let's pretend you're a tollbooth worker and I'm molesting you.
You're gonna have to pay a high to if you want to get into this tunnel.
For those of you who turned out to see my stand-up comedy debut at Zany's last night,
But today's breaking news is that the New England Toy and Game Company has issued an immediate recall of all of its stuffed bears, like the one shown here.
The bear's eyes can become easily detached and pose a potential choking hazard.
Oh, my God, that's the same teddy bear Stewie has.
Boy, I wonder if there's anything more on Channel Two about this.
Our top story, Channel Five News anchor, Tom Tucker, has a meltdown at a local comedy club.
Look at you, you fat, gross Moroccans with your ooga-booga food.
It was the first time I had an orgasm out the front and back.
You know, I even won a deep voice contest with Joe yesterday.
Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun and the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead-end road.
I feel like I have a secret lover nobody else knows about.
Ms. Simon, enough years have gone by since you wrote your classic hit, You're So Vain.
Don't you think it's time to tell the world who that song was written about?
No. That will always be a secret between me and him.
This is the first day we're allowed to the end of the driveway, and I intend to take full advantage.
You ever notice how in every photo of P. Diddy, his mouth is hanging open?
Well, actually, Diddy hired a guy to close his mouth for him.
I'm telling you, this kid is the next Justin Bieber.
Young girls love him, but he makes real music that...
My white blood cells attacked the pathogens and created antibodies, and then the pathogens were filtered out by my kidneys into my urine and then expelled from my body, you slut.
I had no control over what I did yesterday, Peter.
I mean, I'm glad you're feeling better, but, boy, that sick voice of yours was hot.
Yeah, sounds like being sick was really working for you.
I got to make myself sick again and get that voice back.
Peter, that might be the worst idea anyone has ever had.
I'm gonna be a woman at work who cannot get sick right now.
There's Kendra's birthday and the baby shower, and with this move, I-I just cannot get sick right now.
If one more person asks me about a patient today,
I'm sorry, but you need to stay here and get better.
You owe me from when I took you to see Shakespeare in the Park, even though it was the part of the park where the gay guys go to have sex.
I need you to drive me to that toy factory so I can get Rupert back.
Tell you what, you drive me to Middleborough, and I'll teach you my secret to picking up chicks.
I'm one woman who knows a thing or two about sports.
All right, finally a little harpoon in the bowling alley.
All right, what do you say we get this thing started, huh?
And it would be four if someone could've hit that seven-ten split, right?
So when you guys aren't celebrating a big bowling victory, what do you normally do here?
For one thing, there's the boobs, which Kristen Stewart does not have.
Also, I get the sense that Kristen Stewart is more of a bath person when she really needs a shower.
Yeah, someone should write wash me in the dust on that flat ass.
Well, here we are. great. Hey, may on the ride home, someone else can tell a story.
This tour will take us deep into the factory, and when the time is right, we'll slip away and find Rupert.
Every once in a while, one of our toys becomes real, and we have to make sure it doesn't get out.
I had to deliver a speech to Britain, and I overcame my stutter through some pretty kooky means.
This is not the way out! This is not the way out!
Hey, Horace, get that wiener out of your hand and give us three more beers over here!
We shot some drug dealer this morning, and he had three Red Sox tickets in his pocket.
You know, if we leave right now, we can probably still get there before the first pitch.
Peter, it's so good to see you up and around!
Doctor said I'd be making bland jokes for about a week, then I'd be good as new.
Well, we were just on our way up to Fenway.
You know, there's no better outing than watching nine innings.
Oh, well, actually, we only have three tickets, and we're going with Lois.
Oh, yeah, we've actually been having a great time with her.
Do you mind if I go to the game with the guys?
Hey, Horace, why don't you take that wiener out of your hand and get me a beer.
Don't talk to me that way, you son of a bitch!
I've just been hanging out here having a great time with...
Well, maybe next time you can come with us when we go to Red Sock Field.
Quags and Swanny were so funny yelling things at the visitors.
Lois, it's one thing to steal my friends, but don't go giving them stupid new nicknames.
No, I asked you to take my place at the bowling tournament, that's it!
Look, Lois, I have my friends, and you have groceries and all those rusty pink razors in the shower.
Now just stick to what's intended for you and leave my things to me.
Are you saying you want me to stop hanging out with Joe and Quagmire?
And you know how hard it is for me to make new friends.
Wow. I wish you could hear how racist you sound right now.
Come on. Can't you give that giraffe at home another chance?
You know, for every one they sell, they save a giraffe in the wild.
Next thing you know, we're partying all night with the trapeze people!
Peter, relax. It just happens that your wife has some funny stories, that's all.
Now he can't take care of his own bathroom needs.
I haven't seen him like this since he saw that Rocky Dennis movie.
So this is what it feels like to be a grown-up, huh?
You and Rupert had some special times together, and you'll always have that.
Maybe I can use this helicopter to knock Rupert off the conveyor belt...
Look, Peter, I think there's something we should talk about.
I'm not reading the last page of that dinosaur book.
No, Peter, we need to talk about this situation with the guys.
Look, of course I like hanging out with Joe and Quagmire.
I mean, it's nice to make new friends, but not if it means losing the best friend I've ever had.
Yeah, well, I was probably kind of a jerk, too.
I guess I shouldn't be telling you who you can and can't be friends with.
Hey, you guys want to go with me and Joe to the roller derby?
It's great. You get to see big, husky chicks elbow each other right in the jugs.
Yeah, and I'm bringing my grill so we can eat corn in the parking lot before we go in.
I got a huge stack of coupons to go through.
Plus, I'm planning on having my period really hard later, and I want to be in the tub when it happens.
Guys, I think Lois is getting a visit from her Aunt Period.
Yeah, and lots of other chick stuff you guys wouldn't be interested in.
All right, Drunken Clammers, this is it, the most important game of the season.
Good. 'Cause there's nothing an unstretched middle-aged body likes more than explosive movements.
Now remember, we're here to impress the girlfriends of guys we barely know, so when you get the ball, throw it like a cannon.
Yes, you must leave them behind, and they must be in a crumbly mess so that the city clean-up workers have to chase the little bits when the wind blows.
Excuse me, has anyone seen a toy car around here?
Can you fill out a prescription for us for diarrhea?
Oh, yeah? Well, speaking of things that are brown and can run, meet our new teammate!
That's right. We got to know each other while I was following him around my store.
What's up, fools? I'd like to dedicate my performance today to Miss Whitney Houston.
Get a hit so I can bring a sports trophy home for my parents!
Oh, yes, I love living here, in the next town over.
I promised a kid in the hospital I'd hit a home run for him.
All right, guys, one more out and the game is ours.
Let's put some leaves on him and go get some ice cream.
I can't believe we left Brian in the car with the windows up.
Like when you're the only one at the table where the waiter doesn't say, Good order.
It was caught fresh less than ten miles from here.
It is a spectacular cut, superbly seasoned and the marbling is some of the best I've ever seen.
I'd just like to say that... before today, I didn't know the Munsters were driving around in a funeral car.
I'm beginning to think everything on that show was a big joke.
Perhaps there are some men who would like to say a few words.
And so let us take a look back on his life through this video commemorating all the DUI's that he was responsible for.
I've been yo-yoing a turd for the last 20 minutes.
No. No, no, I'm just... not used to seeing corpses that big and not in a toilet.
Thanks. You know, I could use some part-time help here preparing the bodies, if you're interested.
I could use the money, and I'm getting kind of tired of my old job.
Only a half a point divides our top two competitors as we enter the last event, the Meg Roll.
You think it's cool to go drinking right after Horace's funeral?
All right, guys, I know that yesterday was a rough one for us.
But it's with great pride that I'm gonna turn this zero into a one.
Horace owed more than this place is worth, so it's the bank's now.
The banks took our bars, our businesses and then our homes.
I am the Wind Maker and I shoot monkeys now.
Welcome to the party. Can I offer you some punch?
Joanie Loves Chris Brown was taped in front of a very uncomfortable studio audience.
I mean, as long as we got a place to drink and a restroom for businessmen to have homosexual encounters.
Oh, come on, Lois, we got to have a place to drink.
I just don't think a good way to start a screenplay is, 400 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland.
Yeah, and don't you think it's confusing that every character in the movie is named Movie Guy? Come on, you guys.
The Oscars are next week, so let's get this done.
Meg, I'm needed upstairs, so I'll let you finish up.
It makes the eyes look a little less dead and hollow.
Oh, uh... you have what we call a closed casket face.
I got locked out of the house, and I need your key.
No way! You get to work with all these dead people?
You're like one of those Asian-Americans who fought in Vietnam.
Peter, I thought you were taking us to a new drinking spot.
What are we doing at the Clam? Look, guys, we tried other bars, we tried drinking at home, we even tried the big end-of-the-year high school party that will change everything.
If we don't lose our virginity tonight, we're never gonna make it in college!
Only talking to Amanda Small, the hottest girl in school.
But I thought you was workin' on your garbage sculpture.
Sorry, Amanda. By the law of '80s movies, a newly transformed tomboy supersedes your long-standing hotness.
Let's face it-- there's only one drinking spot for us, and it's the Clam. But, Peter, it's closed.
Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you, do you take that as an answer?
My lawyer has advised me not to answer that question.
Come on, guys, this is trespassing and it's against the law.
Maybe we should just let the Clam go and, I don't know, spend more time with our families.
I just spend most of the time testing Chris to see if he's autistic.
My grandfather used to bring me here when I was a kid.
The doors are a little short, but that's okay, because we're smaller back now.
I'm gonna go insane in a wheelchair, staring at the sea.
This is everything about.. if it's the Clam, I love it.
Hey, uh, remember... remember-remember when... remember when... remember when Quicktime here passed out in this... in this booth... this booth, and we did stuff to him that you do to ladies and we-we promised we'd never tell you.
All... all the greatest... all the greatest moments of my life,
Why is... why is Label Guy trying to punch me?
It takes a man to know what a man likes.
Mr. Dougan in a gray suit for the wake tomorrow.
And don't try to act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
And don't lie, or I'll tell Jennifer Connelly that you're the one who's been mailing her those dog heads.
Uh, yes, I'd like to mail this to a whore.
I used the body to get me into R-rated movies.
After that, I took him swimming and he fell apart.
Chris, Mr. Dougan's wake is tomorrow, and there's going to be a body in that casket.
And no one says anything, which means they hate it.
We're here to demolish this building by order of the bank.
We interrupt this program for a Channel Five breaking news report.
Three local men have barricaded themselves inside a Quahog bar, and are currently in a standoff with authorities.
We now go live to Joyce Kinney, who attended her sister's wedding last night.
One of the suspects has been identified as Peter Griffin.
I'd be married, too, if I were willing to date a Persian.
All right, what do you want for your last meal?
Let's not make this any harder than it has to be.
It's where the three of us made that suicide pact that Quagmire and I are gonna back out of at the last minute.
Peter, you get out here right now, or else I'm throwing away all of your Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.
I want you to go in there and end this thing.
I got to get that guy out of my head.
This is our Clam, and we are not gonna let them take it.
Hey, Joe, is this the same chief whose wife is a real hog?
You really want to throw away your career on this?
I have no choice but to place you all under arrest.
Listen, it's kind of all my fault this happened in the first place.
Plus, as a former athlete, it's my responsibility to invest my earnings in a restaurant, bar, or car dealership.
Look, I felt bad about what I did to Horace.
So, when I heard on the news that they were tearing down his bar,
I saw buying it as a way to carry on Horace's legacy.
And all because I believed in myself like Pop-Pop always said.
Meg, the family is here for Mr. Dougan's wake, so could you please bring in the body?
Eli, you threw for three touchdowns today, which isn't bad, except Peyton had four.
My husband had filled out an organ donor card before he passed away, and a woman just lost her face in a freak accident.
Well, it sure is good to be back in the old Clam.
I don't know. It's just a German guy listing items and then declaring them good.
Das Ist Gut is filmed before an audience of the mentally feeble.
God, I wish I could get tickets to that show.
We interrupt this program to bring you a Channel Five News special report.
The latest police statistics have revealed a significant rise in crime throughout Quahog.
And just to put it out there, Tom Tucker is packin'.
I drive a 2006 Infiniti, and I don't intend to lose it.
You're in the house 14 hours a day. What would you notice?
Well, I hate to admit it, Lois, but over the last couple of years, this town has changed a lot, a not necessarily for the better.
Yeah, I mean, the other day, I left a doodie right in the middle of a Crate and Barrel.
The bullies have been so busy, they're outsourcing their bullying to India.
Okay, do you see the back of your underwear in the mirror?
Okay, I want you to pull it up as high as you can.
You know, it's hard for me to take the things you say seriously when I know what's been in that mouth of yours.
Look, I realize Quahog isn't the small town it used to be, but it's still very special to me.
Yeah, come on, guys, she's got dyed roots in this community.
Lois, I know you love this town, but nothing is ever as innocent as it seems.
Not one fish at a time as a reward! All of them!
Okay, the one thing you don't want to do is tell me to take it easy.
Yeah, now I'm gonna balance a ball on your face.
We finally went to a restaurant without somebody yelling at us, and then the rest of the place applauding them.
Well, we'll just have to get that $17 insurance check and start over.
Oh, my God, it's so creepy to think there were strangers in our house.
They took my dirty rope that was tied in a knot!
Pretty soon, guys are just gonna be showing their boners to babies and stuff, I bet.
It's sad to think that Quahog isn't safe for families anymore.
I mean, all I ever wanted was to raise our children in a wholesome place, far away from all the crime and problems of the big city.
Um, I'm looking for a wholesome place for my family to live, so I'd like to buy your farm.
All right, well, the going rate for my farm is $875,000.
Well, somebody... somebody from Fox was supposed to call ahead.
They usually take care of it, and then I just go ahead and do stuff.
Hey, Lois, you know how I'm always buying things impulsively?
Well, that's gonna be very hard to do now that we're living on a farm.
Peter, you went out and bought a farm without even talking to me about it?
Well, Lois, in my defense, I have nothing to back up the beginning of this sentence.
And it's not like it's the first time you made a big family decision without consulting me.
Peter, where'd you even get the money to make that kind of purchase?
And I did it on Craigslist, so I also made a dangerous friend.
What do you want me to do, start all over?
Lois, you were saying yourself how you want our kids to grow up in a wholesome place away from the big city.
And, Chris, you been telling me how you wanted to watch animals humping other animals what might not be okay with it.
Just think of this farm as our next great adventure.
Like when we tried to invade the city of Troy.
Will you join me in eating eggs fresh out of a chicken's butt?
Yay! Now I can be one of those filthy teens with sad eyes at a farmer's market!
Well, with what's become of Quahog, maybe it is time to make a change.
We've decided to take you to a nice, big farm upstate.
A farm with big open fields, Brian, where you can just run and run and be free and no one will ever hurt you.
I feel like those miners who first struck gold in San Francisco.
Well, Lois, a big part of owning a farm is crossing a road very slowly with cows.
Hey, come on, man! I got to get to work!
Hey, I thought I told you kids to go plow in the field.
Look, I know it seems like dirty work, but, Chris, you got to spread that seed until your sack is empty.
And, Meg, you got to clear away all that brush so he can plant it deep where it needs to be.
Okay, we'll keep at it, but I think that hoe is pretty much worn out.
Part of being a farmer is having a best friend named Larry who I spend huge amounts of time with, but never actually talk to.
Peter, I've been running the numbers on this farm, and we're in deep trouble.
And meanwhile, you're spending half our money down at the General Store, and the other half at the Specific Store.
And is it true that you've been spending the farm's money on gingham shirts you tie into a knot to expose your belly?
Well, with all this debt and no income, there's no way we're gonna be able to keep up our bank payments.
Great, just what I need on my conscience: another failed business.
I have a poster from The Proposal you can look at.
Look, it's like I've been saying, farming is very difficult.
Farming takes incredible skill and knowledge and the sort of specialized experience that takes generations to acquire.
My point is that maybe I should go to the local state college and take some agriculture courses.
With the proper training, maybe I can actually learn something that will save this farm.
And, hey, maybe I could give the speech at your graduation.
And so, as I look out at your smiling faces filled with hope, all I can think is, you are completely screwed.
As Martin Luther King once said, Ouch, I've been shot.
The proudest day of a man's life is when his dog goes off to college.
Hang on, guys, it might just be the Tasmanian Devil.
Hey, maybe it has one of those things that goes...
You guys, there's a fully functional meth lab in our basement.
Now, I know you're freaked out, but when you really stop and think about it, this meth lab is our family's best chance to make meth in a lab.
This lab is just what we need to get back on our feet.
Dealing drugs is morally wrong, not to mention incredibly dangerous.
You remember when we did it in the bathroom at that restaurant?
Yeah. You go in first, and I'll go in a minute.
Just for a bit, just till we get the farm back on its feet.
I don't know... Lois, we've always given our family whatever it needs.
Well, right now, our family needs us to sell illegal drugs to the tank top community.
All right, Peter, we can make one meth, and that's it.
And it's only because I don't see any other way out of this.
I'm going to respond violently to outside noises that the rest of you don't hear.
That was just me saying, That was just a cricket.
I want to show my kids what it looks like when a bitch dies!
Well, maybe I should just fire a couple of rounds into the darkness.
And I want you to be there whenever there's a bad joke.
I don't want to put them in a bad mood.
I've trained this carrier pigeon to do all my deliveries for me.
Yes, hello, I'd like to buy or similar pseudoephedrine-based decongestant.
I'm back from agricultural school, and I might have the solution to our farming trouble.
Here's a new kind of meth you put in your pee-hole.
I turn my back for a month, and this place turns into a drug den!
For your information, it is also a drag queen hangout.
Our top story: Methamphetamine is flooding into Quahog in epidemic amounts, and is believed to be originating from the nearby rural community of Farmton.
For more on the story, we now go live to Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa.
All those drugs that are flooding into Quahog are from us.
Well, if we're dealing so many drugs to Quahog, why is the Quahog envelope so light this week?
Yeah, I say we go down there and talk to those people in Quahog.
I forgot you don't even know your ass from a hole in the ground.
If any of you want to come with me, you're welcome to.
First of all, you sat in something green and it's on your butt, so no one's gonna follow you.
And second, no one's gonna leave a place where there are tons of beakers for a place where there are zero beakers.
It's time to go back to Spooner Street and be the Griffins again.
And the lab inside the house, which is currently producing an incredibly volatile and explosive batch of thermo-reactive chemic...
Well, it's good to be back in our old house.
How did we get this place back, by the way?
Well, luckily the value of this place plummeted because this is a meth town now.
You know, I think the lesson here is that if your community has problems, you don't abandon it.
It's better to stay put and help fix those problems.
That's right, Lois, 'cause wherever you run to, your problems have a funny way of finding you.
Thanks for encouraging us to come to Gay Pride Day, Brian.
Laura gets home at 7:00, so I figure we can stare at our wine glasses till then.
So, uh... so, when... when do you guys think you're gonna die?
It's like I'm walking past stuff, but I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, and I'm going on a business trip to Mykonos for July.
And it says this next one is the Shocking Reveal Gay Float.
Well, listen up, everybody, 'cause it's time for our grand prize drawing for those tickets to see Celine Dion live in Las Vegas!
The only thing I ever won was an extra day of summer.
I saw what I look like in a car window, and now I don't want to go.
We now return to Franklin and Bash with Indicators to Show Which One is Franklin and Which One is Bash.
Defensive blows to their heads were to send a message...
Oh, sorry, sorry. Help me get into used car sales.
Hey, Stewie, I don't know if you have any interest in this, but I was wondering if you want to go to Vegas with me and see Celine Dion.
Yes, I was gonna talk to you about that, actually.
Last night, I was thinking to myself, Why fly, when we can get there instantly?
Well, you see, I recently completed construction on a teleportation device, and it occurred to me, this may be the perfect chance to try it out.
Okay, now, the device is powered by kinetic energy, so you've got to dance to make it work.
It appears there may still be a few more bugs to work out.
Well, let's hit the hospital, get checked for teleportation cancer and then party!
Well, since the teleportation machine failed to get us to Vegas, I suppose we should just catch our plane.
You know, this is going to be a good trip, Brian.
Take your Juicy sweatpants and your dirty pillow from home, and your bucket of Coke, and get the hell out of my sight.
Plus, the air is clean because they suck up all the cigarette smoke and dump it in the bad hotels.
I see you've requested a bed that's good for bouncing and jumping?
And you can actually keep that pen if you'd like.
You know, I know we're switching to a digital world, but I-I think this little guy's still got a place in it.
Hey, we should try one of those slot machines by the entrance.
You know, they always set those things to pay out more so they can lure people into the casino.
I haven't had this much fun since I hosted the Oscars.
I just want to say that I have the utmost respect for women everywhere.
Kind of weird they showed Flight 93 on Flight 93.
Hmm, I do have a Griffin here, but that room was checked into hours ago. What?
Yes, and I'm afraid we have no other rooms available.
I see-- is there a less heavy person that could check again for me?
I'm sorry, we're all booked up because the Slut Convention's in town.
They were promised a single millionaire, but it's really just a bunch of horny squirrels in a rich-guy suit.
Well, this sucks. Hey, I'm gonna go try one of those slot machines by the entrance.
They always set those things to pay out more so they can lure people into the casino.
I mean, doesn't it seem weird to you that we have to re-check-in every 20 minutes?
Also the porn is free, but we have to watch it in the lobby.
Okay, let's see if we can turn this trip around.
Do you know what it's like to go to the doctor and see your own foot in the garbage can?
Well, I was on my way to get ice cream and I passed a roulette table, and I put it all on 16 because of that Taylor Swift song, Sixteen.
Oh, come on, you would've done much worse with him.
She does-- you'll be amazed that that voice comes out of that face.
I didn't realize how far that awful hotel is from the Strip.
I know. I actually thought I was gonna win big and get that plastic surgery I always wanted.
I say we just cut our losses and fly home.
And-and you are gonna laugh about this, if I know your dark sense of humor, but I may have gambled away our plane tickets.
Look, why don't we just call Lois and the fat man?
If she finds out it's all gone, she'll kill me.
Honestly, I'm trying to sell my condo, and I need people to come to the open house and talk about how nice it is.
Wow, the price per square foot is quite competitive with similar homes in the area.
I will likely purchase it unless others put in a rival bid.
You know, you've always been so noncommittal in our relationship.
Do know how much it hurt my feelings when you paused before introducing me to your parents?
And it's the same reason you didn't take that job in Denver.
It's like I say, the best thing you can see in Vegas is bar, bar, bar.
Stewie, I'm still not sure this is a great idea.
Then we'll be out of debt and on our way home.
I suppose. I just wish we didn't have to borrow money from a loan shark.
Please indicate here if I look like a schmuck to you.
Uh, next, do you think this is some kind of game?
And 'll at it for us here with Duke losing by just three points.
I want to pay a Wayne Neon look-alike to beat up a Rita Rudner look-alike.
Stewie, we got to get the hell out of here before that loan shark finds us.
I say, Brian, this backpack feels a bit lighter than it did before.
Well, I wasn't gonna tell you till later, but I actually used part of my portion to take care of some personal business.
I just spotted those two idiots who borrowed all that money.
Don't worry; I'll get that money back no matter what, and for sure I'm not gonna stop first and get some crepes in the lobby.
Um, listen, Brian, this might be a good time to tell you, uh,
Okay, come on, you look nothing like your picture in the ad.
You bastards think you can just borrow a bunch of money from a loan shark and then waste it on tacky suits?
Aah! No, no! Stewie, just give him the money from the backpack.
Sir, we can't give you any money, but if you've got some milk and a bowl, we can give you a pretty healthy way to start your day.
You, dog, pick which one of you two is gonna die.
What? You can't ask me to decide something like that.
The life of every being is sacred, just like the life...
Yeah, I was booked for three hours by Archibald Meatpants.
Okay, well, either way, I'm getting paid, and somebody's getting torn open.
We have no money, no way to get home, and one of the loan shark's goons is probably gonna bust through that door any minute and kill us both.
Even if we could get back there, we'd just be putting the whole family in danger.
We're stuck here, just waiting for some mobster to do it.
Well, not clean for the staff of the hotel, but that's not really gonna be our problem anymore.
Look, it's not like we've got a lot to live for.
I mean, I'm just gonna end up like Chris, only I'll be smart enough to realize how miserable I am.
And you've only got a few good years left anyway, and that's if we even get out of here alive.
You know, the only thing that was holding me back even a little is knowing how much Lois is gonna milk this.
Everyone, I truly want to thank you for your support and remind you that, as far as casseroles go, we're good on pasta, but we could use some more dessert items.
Oh, I miss my baby so much, and I'm more of a chocolate person than a fruit person.
Well, looks like Archibald Meatpants is gonna have a fun night.
The machine must have created two pairs of us-- one that was teleported to Las Vegas and the other that wasn't.
Oh, well, th-these thugs came to shoot you, and I tried to throw myself in front of the bullet, but it must have gone, like, under my armpit or something
I tried like hell to talk you out of it, but you jumped off a balcony.
People keep coming back every hour because they think it's a regular show, like-like the volcano or the pirate ship thing.
Um, uh, the only thing is, I'm a little short.
Is there any chance you could cover me for the ticket?
You know, the other you was a lot more fun.
How does it feel to be the least cultured person at a bus station?
There are tornados in the Midwest, and I like watching poor people scramble to save what little they have.
I'm gonna play this really loud tonight to get back at our Armenian neighbors.
Yeah, look, I'm guessing there's some kind of soccer match from your home country going on, and I get that, I do.
But, uh, some of us are trying to sleep, and I could almost deal with the noise, but it's the cologne, all right?
I can smell it in my bed, and I live two houses from here.
Okay, so I know you're a harmonica, but right now you're a 40-year-old woman with a good body in a hotel pool.
I work out seven days a for these five minutes.
Your attention is going to keep me from swallowing a bottle of pills.
I'm digging a hole under the fence in the backyard.
Oh, you know what, hang on, I left my harmonica in the tub.
Oh, my God, it was in the tub, and now it's in my butt!
Stewie, Daddy needs your tiny hands for a very special project.
By the way, Mr. Griffin, regarding your X-rays, we're making a coffee table book.
Unfortunately, removing it would require a very expensive surgery that's not covered by your T.G.I. Friday's gift card.
What was that? I don't know, but suddenly it smells like John Popper in here.
I will not allow this opportunity to go to waste.
Terrible. I accidentally backed over a kid in the grocery store parking lot.
I ran right over the soft part of the face.
I ditched the car and jumped on a passing train.
I didn't get off until I was in the South.
I pushed a boy behind your car so I could do all this harmonica stuff.
I have been selected to be a contestant on America's Got Talent!
And they're gonna fly us all to America for the show!
I am gonna make this family proud, and not just you guys, but that old painting of my ancestor in the attic.
I'm gonna go talk to the statue in the basement.
Let's welcome our next performer, here to play the harmonica, Peter Griffin.
I wonder if I can get my old job back painting kids' faces at birthday parties.
You're just drawing penises with a Sharpie on children's faces.
I'm Chris. You look nice, so I'll blow my burps the other way.
Eh, I did all right for a guy who just had his first homosexual experience with his guitar teacher.
All right, guys, keep an eye out for our stuff.
I got tired of not being able to find my bags, so I tied a vaguely Hanna-Barbera-looking character to it.
I really enjoyed sitting next to you on the plane, Chris.
I'm sorry I screamed when that guy from India got up to stretch.
Look, I'm having brunch tomorrow with my grandparents at the Barrington Country Club.
I must notify Gossip Girl! Pass this along to Gossip Girl.
And that means me and the other jocks get to throw you in the pool.
All right, you're kind of heavy, so-so-so we're gonna pee on you.
Hey, listen, Mr. Barrington, y-your granddaughter ain't no tease, right?
I don't know, they all kind of look the same.
Uh, Peter, why don't you tell me more about your job.
Peter, why don't you and I grab some air, huh?
Look, I've been trying to get into Reginald Barrington's inner circle for years.
They've been the most elite family in this country ever since it was founded.
They were the ones who invented the buckle on the hat.
Well, I went to three stores to find this shirt.
And to think, yesterday I was just a guy at home eating catnip.
Excuse me, Mr. Pewterschmidt, but you're no longer a member at this club.
Now, look, Peter, j-just because you're a member now and I'm your guest, that doesn't mean things are gonna change between us, right?
And I switched out one of his eyeballs for a gag exploding eyeball.
And then I paid a couple of Mexicans to run over him with their car.
I hope they don't just take the money and skip town.
Oh, my God, I meant say you're sorry, not take off your pants.
And now that I've made you aware of the misunderstanding, you're still continuing with it.
I got a big-ass coat, chair to sit in, chalice cup of wine and a midget, but I ain't going out there with all them monsters out there!
I like your hair. Well, Daddy, you've been treating Peter like dirt for years.
Did you go to the Asian guy with the one name?
Well, now that you know how it feels, maybe you want to give him an apology.
Look, Peter, I'm sorry for the way I treated you, but is there anything you can do to get me back in the club?
Really? Oh, Peter, you don't know what this means to me.
Oh, you know, I was so desperate there for a while,
Oh, you don't want to get involved with them religious groups.
If I believe in Snake Jesus hard enough, he will die.
If I believe in Tree Jesus hard enough, both of them will die.
Hey, there's the guy who denied my health insurance claim.
I want Hershey Kiss nipples, and I want you to pay for them!
Can you talk to that angry little boy down by the river bank?
I know it seems unfair, but, hey, there ain't no rules in a tickle fight.
Everyone knows rich, Waspy girls are the best at it.
Walking around the locker room naked and offering people sections of a tiny clementine.
I mean, it's just human nature to suck up to the people above you, crap on those beneath you and undercut your equals.
Well, then we just got to figure out a way to make you fancier than Barrington, so he's got to suck up to you.
No, no, I'll just take a big backward-knee step in the opposite direction.
Yes, I'll have the filet mignon, and they can start the sunset now.
Someone important must be arriving because they're making a big entrance.
Announcing the arrival of His and His Majesty, the exceedingly wealthy and very important
Viscount James Earl Tennis Racquet, and Duke of Lacrosse Team.
Your Majesty, won't you please join me as my personal guests in the Barrington Room?
Peter, that's the most exclusive room in all of New England.
Yeah, I hear it's even harder to get in there than the University of Arizona.
Have a seat in the deepest, most luxurious leather chair in the world.
In fact, we just came from a meeting with the venerable Carter Pewterschmidt.
Really? Yeah, well, he used to be a member here, but he was very annoying.
You know, he got a piece of Jackie Kennedy before she was defiled by that hairy olive-eater.
Yeah, and-and he once made me a grilled cheese sandwich after this.
Well, I wasn't sure about Pewterschmidt, but after hearing you gentlemen talk, maybe I could give him another chance.
Hey, let's get a couple of girls and have seventh-grade-in- the-same-room-make-outs. Carter? Wait a minute.
You're not worthy to lick my designer shoes, you fat, low-life slob!
Here, skip this rope and do a lively schoolgirl chant.
The way you abused that man just now, the way you treated your lesser--
I thought you were just some suck-up loser, but you have shown me that you've got the mettle to be one of us.
Yes. Now, I believe there is just one last piece of unfinished business to take care of here.
I'm sorry, but the Viscount James Earl Tennis Racquet and Duke of Lacrosse Team already arrived two hours ago.
Peter, I'm sorry you've got to give up the country club life.
I don't think those rich guys have it all that great.
Oh, I bought a tie so I can loosen it when I'm beat.
Peter, I think what everyone's saying is that you've got dad breath.
Guys get older, they stop paying attention to hygiene, their bodies are changing...
It's just a fact that, at a certain age, men start to rot from the inside out.
Huh. Maybe that explains what happened with that new guy at work today.
As you can see, we are predominantly an East Coast beer.
Hey, there's gonna be a quiz on all this later.
Someone said that to me once, now I say it.
Hey, Lois, what do you say we do what Anderson Cooper tried once before he decided he hated it?
You're you and I'm Peter, only with much worse knees.
I think I finally want to make love to a 1950's spaceman.
I don't trust myself not to jump out the window.
All right, fat man, two can play at that game.
All right, that's it, Peter, we've got to do something about that awful breath.
I'm making an appointment, and you are going to the dentist.
Geez, you are not gonna let this go, are you?
Well, she's long gone, so, uh, you can go, too.
Oh, no, you got me for another three and half hours, pal.
Well, tuck me into your waistband and try not to pee up your shirt.
It's been weeks since I ordered from Hurry Up, Shrimp.
On average, Americans spend upwards of 50,000 hours waiting for shrimp over the course of their lives.
When I heard that, I thought to myself, Why on earth don't these guys just hurry up?
And since you were so well behaved at the dentist, you can order anything you want.
Oh, Dad, when do I get to go to the dentist?
You know, that's a real treasure map you've got there.
Ah, yes. You see, legend has it that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket hid his fortune in fear of it being taken by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
He died before he could retrieve it, and left behind only this map.
Many believe his treasure is still buried right here in Rhode Island.
Okay, I'm gonna go do diarrhea, and then I'll be right back to take your order.
Peter, please, that's just a place mat to distract your children while you're eating.
You see, you see that rock next to the X?
I know that rock, Lois-- it's right near Route 2.
I'm finding that treasure. Peter, the map is a joke.
Hey, Lorraine, whatever happened to that guy Marty from high school?
Really? Sure you didn't run into him, oh, say, about 16 years ago?
I'm talking about the fact that our son, who you insisted we name after that guy Marty, looks exactly like him!
You think I'm an idiot? That I wouldn't notice that our son is a dead ringer for the guy who fixed us up?
Mom, Dad, I accidentally set fire to the living room rug!
Hey, guys, who wants to dig for buried treasure with me?
Well, this child's place mat is telling me to dig for buried treasure by the side of the highway.
Yeah, we're not going along with another one of your stupid ideas.
Each year, the environment covers more than 40% of the Earth.
The Earth neither hates nor loves, but sits, waiting patiently, for people to do famous stuff.
Oh, no, it's the one kid who also followed the treasure map.
Well, it's not the treasure, but it looks like it's a clue to where the treasure is. Face the circle in the square, you'll see me, I'll show you where.
Okay, well, if there is a treasure out there, we don't want anybody else to know about it.
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker, here with local fortune seeker Peter Griffin, who appears to have found a clue to a hidden treasure.
That's right, Tom, and I sincerely hope that the caption beneath me doesn't say Local Fatty. Let's do something about that caption.
All right, well, you can check out the clue at our Web site:
Quick, Neil! Sign into the neighbors' Wi-Fi so we can get that clue.
Nurse, write down that clue, and then go out in the waiting room and... maybe start lowering expectations.
I don't know nothin'. Everyone doubted me, so I wanted to rub it in their faces that I was right.
Yeah, is there anything else we should know before we start looking?
If Joe or I found this, we'd want you right alongside us.
Look, you guys doubted me, mocked me, constantly handled my Eggo despite my clear instructions, and now you want a piece of my treasure?
It seems like this treasure is already turning people against each other.
I think I might have figured something out. The circle in the square.
Let's see, Face the circle in the square. Face the circle. Face.
Look! When you face this way, you're looking at the statue of Miles Musket.
Look-- there's a plaque! This square shall forever honor the memory of my son, Timmy Musket. Always a chip off the old Block. May he rest in peace.
Wait-- when I played Jane Musket in the school play the last three weekends-- thanks for coming...
I learned that Timmy Musket is buried in a cemetery on Block Island.
That must be what chip off the old Block means!
Your mother and I are taking the ferry to Block Island!
Even if Dad finds the treasure, he's not gonna share.
I mean, last time we came into some money, he just wasted it on all those diamond pinkie rings for everybody.
If this treasure's going to be found, it's up to you and me, Brian.
What do you mean? Come on! You think the fat man's gonna figure out those clues?
Yes, I mean, he's the guy who put all those little bald men in incubators because he thought they were babies.
I've ever seen a single person eat a Mounds bar.
So, you walk into a store, you see the hundreds of options for candy, and you choose a Mounds bar?
Uh, I've probably been having a Mounds bar two or three times a day for the last 25 years.
Your kidneys are drowning in a stew of chocolate and coconut!
Why the hell are we taking a hot air balloon?
Two friends sailing in the sky in a wicker basket with a strange man holding a cheese plate?
Then you get in there, and you order like you never heard of food before!
Well, I hate to say it, but I guess we're supposed to dig this kid up.
If anyone's digging into this little kid's grave, it's me!
I am not gonna stand here and be a part of this madness.
I will have one scoop of mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone.
Feels so weird to be looking at a dead kid and not have angry parents nearby.
Hey, look! There's something written inside the lid. You've crossed the miles, you've pawed through clues.
By the way, for those who came on my boat,
This is a great time for me to do my Suzuki Samurai promo!
All that really matters is the money you get in exchange for the treasure.
I guess I had to learn that the hard way.
And I'm really sorry about how I treated you and the kids.
So I guess everyone else came to their senses, too, huh?
She saw me. You've crossed the miles, you've pawed through clues.
Peter, this can't be leading them to a baseball stadium.
You know, Peter, in the first eight minutes of Meg's play, before I walked out, they said Miles Musket was a horrible drunk and a wife beater.
So, when it says, hits, misses, it might be talking about hitting Mrs. Musket.
And he probably misspelled missus because he was drunk when he wrote it.
Or maybe he misspelled it because cursive is hard, and everyone should get off his back.
And cheers and boos might be referring to a bar where he would cheers, and drink his booze. Hits missus, cheers and booze.
Wait a minute-- it's got to be an old bar, right?
All right, let's you put some makeup on and get right down to The Clam!
This is worse than the time we were in The Clam right now.
Here, hold this. Congratulations. You have won The Founding Father Restaurant Treasure Hunt Challenge. Please enjoy one free meal at select Founding Father locations.
Um, this sucks worse than when I went to that strip club without Lois.
Well, Peter, I hope you're not disappointed we didn't find any treasure.
You know, the important thing is we figured out those clues together.
I mean, so what we won't be able to pay to fix them veins in your legs.
You're my treasure, Lois, and I want you on my team for everything.
I always feel like that priest has it in for me.
I'm getting tired of you wearing the same thing every day.
I'd like to point out that Jesus wore the same thing every day.
And you didn't hear Alice giving him a hard time about it.
And afterward, you're going to the mall to go clothes shopping.
Last time I tried shopping without you, it was a disaster.
Yeah, I was driving past there, and we were out of some stuff, so I...
Yeah, I like saying that more than I like you doing things.
All right, even though we just walked in, and this whole place is one hallway, let's consult the map.
I'll bet we can find you some new clothes in here.
Hey, Lois, are you sure this place is for men?
I'm gonna go look for a couple things for me in here.
Okay, Lois, I'll be right here, standing uncomfortably close to the unnecessary piano player in the middle of the mall.
Did you ever have a bank account full of pedestrians' disinterested smiles?
There aren't enough verses in any song I could write that would express how much hatred I have in my heart.
Oh, come on. When I was a boy, we always used to go clothes shopping at Sears.
He says he'll take you to the clothes for herbs and meat.
Well, we can probably come up with some herbs and meat, right, Peter?
Lois, I weigh the same that I weighed in grade school.
Perhaps it's this lump on the side of your neck, sir.
I think, emotionally, I've always been a lizard, you know?
And now, I feel comfortable finally in my leathery, scaly skin.
Is this just to get out of my parents' visit?
Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge lump growing on his neck.
It appears you have a subcutaneous vestigial twin growing on your neck.
Well, it's an incomplete twin that never developed into a fully-formed person but still exists as a growth feeding off your body.
I'm just gonna give you a little topical anesthetic, and we'll have a closer look.
Well, it looks as if he's more fully formed than we thought.
Finally, I'll have an interesting silhouette for the beginning of my spoken-word jazz.
Kids, remember how when you were little, you always wanted a neck uncle?
I like to poke him 'cause it makes him happy, and I feel it a little bit in my nads.
I don't want it cramping my style while I'm macking on toddlers.
You know, Lois, a lot of times you go into someone's house, and it's just a house, but you can tell this is a home by all the love here.
Hey, you must be the owner of that Prius outside.
He gets what we Prius owners are trying to do.
Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you all kinds of cool stuff.
My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts, even my new musket.
Go stall 'em for 20 minutes and pray that it's not too damp in here.
Oh, when you're trapped under a layer of fat, a muffled folk song is like manna from Heaven.
There's a universal language for all creatures, and it's called love.
Well, I thought we'd start with a vigorous power walk around the neighborhood.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking we would just watch Dr. Oz and eat cold cuts off our stomach.
Did you know that the Quahog Museum has an interactive display on the history of the garment district?
You know, just because everything's new to you doesn't mean you have to do it all at once.
And what is this pamphlet I found under your bed called The Boston He Party?
Wow! Is there any better time in the world than 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday?
You already have two days of hard work under your belt, and there's so much more work to come.
I'm using my knowledge of the local food scene to get this woman to go to bed with me.
What are we watching? Oh, it's just a tennis match.
And this is just the first game of the first round of a three-week tournament?
This is more painful than sitting through those parent-teacher-cheetah meetings.
Keep reading to them every night, and I think we're gonna have a great year.
So unless there are any questions, thank you all for coming.
Uh, yeah, I noticed the hot lunch menu doesn't feature any gazelle.
Yeah. See, I-I heard that last year, and... here we are again.
Listen, Doc, is there any way you can have this thing on my neck removed?
Look, Doc, you got to do the procedure, all right?
No, the ski boots that was in the back flew up and chopped her head off.
You can turn your blinker off now; it's very annoying.
Sorry! The board game that teaches you to be a dick.
So, uh, you know, Chip, now that you're a free man, this is a chance for you to go out and make a real life for yourself someplace.
I'll tell you what, anywhere you want to go, I'll FedEx you.
He said our old furniture was blocking the flow of energy.
And where are the drapes? Chip took them to make play clothes for the children.
I don't get why everyone's so in love with that guy.
What's so great about him? Well, to be honest, the same thing that used to be so great about you.
Just that when you were younger, you were as passionate and full of life as him.
I tell you, Chip is making my life a living hell, you guys.
Remind me again, Chip is that African kid you adopted?
No, that was Chocolate Chip. We gave him back to Kenya.
But I can't take it anymore. I got to get rid of him.
Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'll come up with something.
After all, I'm the guy who invented Choose Your Own Adventure or Have Pie in Bed.
Hey, welcome back to the Mikey Tony Magnanimous Hour, where real people get magnanimous about real things.
This week's real thing-- hey, Native Americans, if I saw you on the street begging,
Oh, he's gonna turn you into a pile on Joe's lawn.
Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.m. Should I give up on breakfast?
Peter, that dingo was meant to eat me, wasn't it?
My family liked me, and-and I didn't feel bad about not ever doing new stuff.
Well, I never asked to grow out of your neck.
I'm out of here, and you could go to hell!
He likes to yell out Good luck! after they read each lottery number.
Whoa, whoa, what are you all coming down on me for?
Meg throws away people who come out of her body all the time, nobody says nothing.
We should look for him in the ball pit at McDonald's.
You can just leave me there; I'll conduct the search.
Meg's right! Come on, kids, let's go find Chip and bring him back!
You guys do whatever you want. I got stuff to do, anyway.
That I will ride once, but then I will call my parents
I want to swim in the pool but only with my shirt on
Great. I have to walk down these stairs the one day I wore heels.
There's no way I'm gonna make it back up those stairs.
Listen, I... I'm sorry for the mean things I said.
We got to get this leg set and get you to the hospital!
Oh, cool. That's the place with all the Ghostbusters cars!
If you had only done that while you were here, we wouldn't be in this mess.
If it weren't for Chip here, you might have lost your leg.
The bad news is, we did an X-ray, and your body is full of a spooky skeleton man.
You've got all the sense of wonder that I somehow lost.
I got so used to watching TV and looking for tiny jean fibers in my nuts,
I forgot there's a whole world out there to experience.
As far as I'm concerned, you're a permanent part of our family now.
Well, that sure is nice of you, Peter, but... there's a big old world out there.
I want to go out and experience it for myself.
Well, I'm sorry to see you go, but I understand.
I'm too tough to cry, but I'm gonna miss you, too.
Hey, thanks for helping me pick out a new computer, you guys.
I wanna take in and out of my pocket every 30 seconds for the next six years.
You know what? I think I'm gonna go with this one.
Guy said it's the newest version. Just came out this week.
You're gonna be like the first guy in the neighborhood to own a Model T.
I'll be there an hour after you with throw-up all over my legs!
You know, we'll have to start thinking about your costume soon.
All right, but let's make sure we don't cover up this, all right?
Oh, look, Chris, here's your costume from the year you went as a condom.
That's the one Grandma and Grandpa brought Stewie when he was still in the hospital.
Oh, and here's the card they sent me. Three kids on $40,000? Have fun with your crap life.
Don't you have a wedding dress to try halfway on and then cry about?
Okay, now-now the arrow on the screen, that's me, right?
I just wanna put pictures of my cat on everyone's Internet computer.
I-I'm just nervous that somebody else is gonna get pictures of their cat on the Internet first, and then I'll always be known as the second guy to get pictures of his cat on the Internet.
Quagmire, I don't know how to tell you this, but there's already cats on the Internet.
It-It's frozen. Oh, my God, oh, my God, it crashed!
Yes, well, you know I turn to poetry when matters of the heart weigh heavily on me. If you're happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
Well, Lois found my old teddy bear, Oscar, in the attic.
And I'm just not sure how to handle it, what with Rupert and all.
Oscar was my... well, he was my first, you know.
Oscar's the only one who can really make me laugh.
I hate to say it, but I'm mostly with Rupert because of his insurance.
It's like you took all the colors that exist and said, , here's a new one.
I-I-I tried to buy a sweater online, and I-I think I got a virus.
Your browser history shows that you've been going to kinkylatinas.net.
I mean, I wanna see Latinas, but I also want them to
Excuse me. I bought this laptop here yesterday, but when I got home I noticed the apple already had a bite taken out of it!
So, yeah, I was the first woman to ride her bike cross-country with no seat.
My face was buried in a pillow all four years.
Whenever I talk about stuff like this, most people look at me like I'm some kind of disgusting perv.
I don't really remember, but I do feel like I might be down a couple of quarts.
She's every bit as kinky and as insatiable as I am.
I thought you said she was just some computer geek.
Her mouth has enough storage space for a giggity-byte. Oh!
Would you like to make it an extra large meal?
All right, I came up here for a photo shoot and it just got way, way out of hand!
Please! You can't tell Rupert I was up here, all right?
Says the guy who freaks out every time a fire engine goes by.
Well, I've always had this fantasy of having sex on the basketball court in front of my high school principal.
Remember you once suspended me for showing my wiener in school?
This isn't as much fun as I thought it would be.
Okay, Glenn, now that we've covered ourselves in black ink, let's do it until we've created every character in the Chinese alphabet.
Wow, I can't even imagine what twisted deviant act you've thought of this time.
Glenn, remember, the thing we love most about each other is that we push each other way beyond our normal boundaries.
Oh, well, excuse me for not being six months old anymore!
Brian, I need you to settle an argument for us: am I Hitler?
Because I don't think that I am, but maybe-maybe I'm off base on this.
You may as well call your family now because I'm not going to Sarasota.
I don't care if we can't get a refund, we're through!
I just hope we can handle it better than blue and yellow did when they split up.
You were supposed to have the kids here by 5:00.
Okay, you know what, let's not... let's not do this in front of the kids.
No, indoors, not okay. No, no, no, no, no, no.
Is this another one of those sex-related injuries you keep getting?
Yeah, it seems like lately that girlfriend of yours is taking things a little too far.
Sonja and I are supposed to go to a Brown Eyes Wide Shut party.
I know you just got back from Vietnam and you love me, but I'm gonna go run a train with this group of Black Panthers I just met.
I know you came all this way to New York to visit me, but I'm gonna go do blow and have sex with a bunch of stockbrokers.
Now that I have the most contagious and incurable disease known to mankind,
And I'll mow the grass and raise the AIDS baby.
Well, I got tired of waiting for you to get home, so I thought I'd come to you.
Come on, Sonja. How about... how about we take a night off, huh?
I mean, I understand that no doesn't mean no, but certainly some word has got to mean no.
You're hurting me, and I really need to clean out my trunk!
Uh, no, Officer, I just had a glass of dinner with my wine.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car and walk a straight line, please.
He never showed this morning, and today's the day we usually go apple picking.
Well, if you're so smart, why don't you come up here and pick them yourself?
I've already checked Glenn's house, and there's no sign he's even been there.
I'm sure if we just check his usual hangouts, someone will have seen him.
He hangs out at the Clam with some fat loudmouth.
Oh, I've been kind of using Rupert as a chew toy.
Okay, you guys, where should we start looking for Glenn?
Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out under all the clutter in my garage.
So, why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away.
Right, and if we can't find him in here, he sometimes likes to hang out in between the blades of grass in my lawn.
And also, in the firewood that needs to be split.
I'll be around back flicking pinecones at a tree with this hockey stick.
Nah, the last time I saw him was three months ago.
Do you want to be an oldies' DJ or a 1980's wrestling manager?
Heart disease looks better when it's wrapped in a tropical, floral pattern.
Oh, I thought he might have been talking about this super kinky woman who's always down here, trying to lure men to her sex slave shed.
I'm not sure, but I've heard she has a unit at Quahog Storage.
Oh, man, I hope we don't catch them doing something freaky.
I'm still weirded out from when I walked in on that masturbating Eskimo.
Brian, I think it's time that Rupert made his choice.
Rupert's been with me, and now he's been with you.
Brian, either you cooperate or I blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.
And before you answer, think of all the good times we've had.
The time we met The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, that winter we lived on the sun, and here's my favorite.
A blank one we can fill up with a future together.
I can't believe the guy with the ponytail and the facial tattoo at the front desk would let this happen.
Boy, if you were ever gonna stand, this would be the time, Joe.
Oh, I swear to God, you get one inch closer to me, and I'm gonna shoot you.
Well, I guess this is as good a time as any.
I might not be alive if it weren't for you.
You know, I guess what I realized from all this is that when it comes to relationships,
Well, I don't know. I guess when I read my Henry David,
I been reading this novel about three guys, happen to be pigs, uh, that decide to build their own houses.
So, now, one of 'em builds his house out of straws.
Right? Now, how the hell do you build a house out of straws?
Besides, you're always naked, except for when Lois dresses you up in that rain gear.
Do I have to wear this on the ferry? Yes, you do.
I heard he knifed a kid on the playground, then beat up the knife.
I heard he can watch Friday Night Lights without crying.
I heard the volleyball team's playing a tournament in San Diego.
The best way to disarm a bully is to befriend him.
Listen, if you ever need the scoop on the local babe scene, just ask.
Oh, hey, Brian. Don't worry, there's no blade in the razor 'cause I'm learning.
What do you mean what's the matter? You're completely naked!
Brian, I can get nude whenever I want, all right?
This is my home, and a man's home is his castle.
I also went to the video store and got Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties.
My moms are going out of town to a scrapbooking-clambake retreat.
They'll just be scissoring stuff and eating clams all weekend.
We now return to the Kentucky Derby, where 90% of the audience roots for the horse with the cutest name.
It's Battle Axe, followed by Redbeard, followed by Bishop, followed by Smiling Pink Bear!
Some psycho just transferred to my school, and he's going to kill me!
I mean, it's like, pop a couple of tampons, you know?
Stewie, do you even know what a menstrual cycle is?
It a good way to get around town, that's what it is.
Well, I heard about how Peter's making you see him naked lately, so I thought the only way to get even is for you to see me naked.
You know what, that makes sense to me. I mean...
You thought you were gonna see my wife's penis, but, no, it's mine!
Remember that all wagers on Friday's Meg Griffin slaughter must be on my desk by Thursday.
Also, Zack Morris, if you could stop freezing time to talk to the camera, the day would go a lot faster.
Oh, my God, you guys, what am I gonna do?
Meg, you've got to find a way out of this fight.
Yeah, Meg. You can do it. You're a smart woman, and women can do anything nowadays.
So I see you graduated number one in your class from Princeton. That's right.
And I'm certified as an accountant and also have a law degree.
Hey, Mom, I need to transfer to a different school.
Meg, we've been over this. Just because a Facebook page has over 2,000 likes doesn't mean you have to kill yourself.
Don't you remember how much money your father wasted so he could make grand staircase entrances?
I figured out how to get out of this fight.
That sex tape I released should be everywhere by now, and then they'll have to kick me out of the school.
Hey, guys, you four are pretty much the toughest guys in school, right?
What would it take to get you to beat up Mike Pulaski?
Oh, yeah? Well, you're looking at 1,000 bucks for something like that.
But it's gonna be hard to get that kind of money.
I get paid $45 million a year to yell at people who have nothing.
Now here's an ad about a fat-people disease you have.
Listen, Meg, we decided that maybe it's best if you don't talk to us anymore.
I don't want to get beaten up by a guy unless it's in a limo after prom.
So you're all gonna ditch me when I need you most?
Mr. Quagmire, the girls' gym class will be in the showers in 20 minutes.
Oh, yeah, they're talking about it in all the girls' bathrooms.
No, you're not, because I'm gonna help you defeat Mike Pulaski.
Be at my house first thing tomorrow morning, and we'll get started.
Okay, Meg, you've got a bully problem, and I'm gonna help you.
But Mr. Quagmire, why would you want to help me?
I wasn't always the confident guy you see before you.
It was 1986, and the cola wars were at a frenzy.
I was sitting in the RC section of the cafeteria when Tracy Bellings approached.
RC is what keeps the big guys on their toes!
You know what RC stands for, don't you? Chicks Rule!
Anyway, that was the beginning of a long, abusive relationship.
It's one thing if you put your penis inside-out in the safety of your own bedroom, but to have it done in the cafeteria...
To this day, I can't have sex with a woman against her will without thinking about rape.
How much it can stuff in, swallow or choke on.
How a scrotum can be stretched into a makeshift sail if stranded at sea.
All this knowledge is gonna help you win your fight.
I haven't been this scared since my dad stopped showering for six months.
Mmm. I will assimilate this new smell into the larger Borg of my smells.
The only way you're going to end this is if you find a way to even the score.
This is just one of those things he won't let up with.
Like when he was guest hosting Inside the Actor's Studio.
I, uh, uh... I don't know any of the Care Bears.
Right, but if you had to pick one, who would be your favorite?
You can just say the color. I know all the Care Bears.
Are you here to dick around, or you want to do Inside the Actor's Studio?
All right, Meg, the best way for you to focus your rage is if I wear the mask of the person who's bullied you every day of your life.
I want you to come at me with everything you got.
Mr. Quagmire, how am I supposed to beat a guy like Mike Pulaski?
Your weird body can be a dangerous weapon if used properly. Okay.
Well, then what we're about to do may seem strange, but just go with it.
Now, Meg, in order to get you into fighting shape,
I want you to drink this glass of raw eggs.
I wouldn't say I'm specifically a hero for driving one.
The heroes are the ones who come back from Iraq and drive a Prius.
It's like I'm just pushing around a plastic bag full of chicken bones!
You gonna put your clothes on?! Yes! Yes! I swear!
Dad, can you give me a ride to the... ?
Um, listen, before we start, could you not hit me here because these are pretty sensitive?
You'd be surprised what my face can do to you!
Did you hear the volleyball team lost in San Diego?
All right, you little bitch, it's time to end this thing!
Meg, I got a feeling you're gonna be around for a real long time.
A year later, my body reacted to a frozen hot dog, and I died of septic shock.
I became the public face of internal hot dog defrosting.
You look like my foot that time Lois made my bath too hot.
Well, I can't look at this for three months, so I've come up with a solution.
Our top story: price wars are heating up between all of the major airlines and even a couple of the little crashy ones.
We now go live to Tricia Takanawa with more on the story.
Tom, I'm standing here at Boston's Logan Airport, where some of the same security people who let the terrorists on the plane are still gainfully employed.
With such low fares, even those who never fly are lining up to buy tickets.
Early reports suggest that this could be the most profitable day for airlines in the last two decades.
Wow. I've never seen so many boats not near bodies of water.
I think that guy with long hair is a lawyer.
Joe and Bonnie went to Europe and had the time of their lives.
Hey, I know a place you can go, Lois: Hell.
Lois, the kids can get all the culture they need right here in Quahog.
I got more culture in my pinkie toe than all of Europe put together.
I got ringworm, too, but it's not classy like this.
Okay, kids, now this is the Quahog Museum of Science.
Now, one thing that makes us more cultured than our European counterparts is high school football.
Then why are we standing here in the parking lot?
Because sometimes your team loses, and you have to beat up the ref.
Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the wake.
Well, if I must accept your proposal in order to break the entail and save my family's estate, then yes, I will marry you.
Today was the last day of the low airfares, and I couldn't let the opportunity pass, so...
Uh, uh... tickets for the, um, the grand opening of the biggest water park in all of Rhode Island.
Hmm, well, pardon my skepticism, Lois, but I didn't read about this in the latest issue of Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.
For fear that, um... th-that this new park would put all other water parks out of business.
Wow, so we really got an inside track on this thing.
Okay, everyone, put the sunblock on now, so when we get off the plane, we go right to the park.
Uh, you-you want to beat the lines, don't you, Peter?
If you look out the left side of the airplane, you'll see the very popular Seven Flags Atlantis.
I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the seatbelt sign, so you idiots can all stretch and let the fart festival begin.
I can't believe you tricked me into going to Italy.
Plus, it might be good for you and me, too.
And God knows we could use a little romance in our marriage.
In college, a lot of guys are gonna make you a dare.
Hey, you know what, guys? We're six hours ahead here.
Look, kids, this is the Forum, where the ancient Romans used to have their famous political debates.
And this is the Penthouse Forum, where dirtbags write letters about boning in the back of grocery stores.
Well, who wants to see where the ancients established the foundation of our American democracy?
And who wants to hear a story about a girl who moved to New York without any underpants?
I know I supposed to be-a so logical, but I get-a so steaming a-mad!
Peter, the kids are going to the Italian circus, so I thought it might be romantic if we watched the sunset from St. Peter's Basilica.
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay here and get frustrated with this nonresponsive hotel TV remote.
Peter, you can't just sit in front of the TV the entire vacation.
You know, I'm really getting tired of you being such a complete stick-in-the-mud.
I can't believe it's too much for you to watch a sunset with your wife in one of the most romantic cities in the world!
Well, what do you expect, Lois? I didn't want to come here he first place. I'd rather be back home.
You know, sometimes I think you forget how lucky you are to have Lois.
She'll go out, kill her roommate during a sex game, and then she'll be fine.
Hey, guys? Do I got to tip the gondolier in here?
I wish I had someone special to share this with.
I show you all-a the things I do all day that make-a me smell like this.
I thought you were dead. Well, paisan, as long as love is alive in Italy, so am I.
Now, look, buddy, there's a million ways to lose a gal, but there's only one sure way to get her back.
When Lois pulled away on that motorcycle, you laid down on the ground and went to sleep.
Well, before you do anything, for God's sake, put some clothes on.
I am here to put you on a pedestal with Italian romance.
Look, Peter, showing up here in that stupid costume isn't going to win me over.
I have convinced to hold up a romantic message just for you.
Wow, Peter, last night was the best sex I've ever had.
We haven't done it like that since we were engaged but allowed to sleep with other people.
The point is, Italy is the best thing that ever happened to us.
What? Peter, but... but we've built a life back in Quahog.
Yeah, but you were right, Lois, we were stagnating back home.
I got-a the most beautiful woman in the world at home, and I no wanna keep her waiting.
It 9:00 a.m. and I've already kissed eight guys twice.
Peter, I know you love it here, but riding your bike around town isn't paying the bills, and the kids aren't learning anything at that Italian school.
I think maybe it's time to go back to our real home in Quahog.
I mean, you have to give most of what you earn to the mafia that terrorizes this village.
Peter, I think it's time we all go back home.
Of course we have to leave as soon as I get an Italian boyfriend.
You know, I still don't understand what he does for a living.
He gathers coins from the air by jumping on mushrooms.
So, you see, Mr. Consulate, all we want to do is get back to our home in America.
Your family must take a citizenship test and go through the immigration process like any other foreigner.
Not only did you destroy your passports, you renounced our citizenship.
Oh, I did that on the Italian social networking site, Shut-up-a-you-facebook.
All right, Meg, part of being an American citizen is having an opinion on certain hot-button political issues.
Now, if you will, please sing the national anthem of the United States.
Now, where you listed employment, some of you wrote Family Guy, and others wrote The Family Guy.
All right, now that you've completed your initial application, it will need to be filed by an immigration lawyer at a cost of approximately $5,000 per person.
And assuming that all goes through, you should have your citizenship back in 16 months.
I'd think you were making it hard to become a citizen on purpose.
Like you don't want any immigrants coming to the U.S.
I wish that were true, Mrs. Griffin, and it probably might be.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sit on my fat wife.
I want to be there for opening night of Karate Kid 5.
Mr. Miyagi, this is kind of embarrassing, but I'm having a problem with erectile dysfunction.
Well, I'm so glad to finally be back home in Quahog.
Well, thanks for showing me and the kids what the rest of the world is like, Lois.
Well, I can't wait to see the rest of the world with you guys.
I know, I know, I messed up. I messed up.
You went back to 17th-century Jamestown and you gave guns to the Indians.
I guess I just have this pathological need to be liked.
Thanks to you, the Indians killed all the white people and took over America.
I mean, you're the one who's always saying, Never alter the past.
All right, so, I guess we'll split the bill 13 ways?
You know, it actually looks like the Native Americans have done all right for themselves.
And it looks like they have medical care as well.
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I've done this several times today, and your husband just isn't responding.
And here it is, the number one song for the 10,000th week in a row, Huya-Huya-Huya!
But I'm afraid our only hope is that perhaps the alternate Stewie in this universe has created his own time machine that we can use.
Well, let's hope so, because otherwise they're gonna kill us.
Yeah, or stick us on some kind of white people reservation.
Everyone was coming around with their daughters, selling Girl Scout corn.
Made me feel so guilty, I had to buy, like, 20 ears.
Hey, shot in the dark, but, uh, is anyone else in the mood to run really fast in one direction?
And it looks like he has a return pad, too.
Listen, uh, we've just been informed that these guns are defective.
Um, anyway, you know how we like to take things back from you people?
Okay, let's do a quick search here. Native American role models. Zero results found.
Hey, what are you gonna do with all those guns?
I don't know, sell 'em to some messed up kid?
This time machine has almost killed us a hundred times, Brian.
So I've decided to get rid of it before something irreparable happens.
But, Stewie, your-your time machine, it's, like, your crowning achievement.
And, hey, at least I've had some fun with it.
I time-traveled ahead to Christmas so I wouldn't have to wait all year for the new toys to come out.
Would you like to donate an extra dollar to the Quahog Food Bank?
And would you like to come home and clean my toilet, while we're both doing stuff for each other?
God, look at all the perfectly good stuff that people just throw out for no reason.
If you have a twin mattress, aren't you pretty much a failure as a human being?
You know, we should take this home and set it up.
Well, I suppose I could use a new hobby now that the time machine is gone.
You know, not every historical event is all it's cracked up to be.
Women, we've spent decades fighting for our right to vote.
So, when you go to those booths and cast your ballot, remember, Warren G. Harding is way the cutest!
Okay, Brian, I'm just putting this out there, but I'm a baby, and only dicks don't let babies win.
You know, usually, I'd be sitting inside writing, you'd be working on one of your machines.
Oh, wait, I got to go grab my knee pads.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but Brian's injuries are just too severe for us to save him.
I don't know how much longer he has, but I suggest that you all go in and say your good-byes.
I was gonna be a little better than you, but we were both gonna be good!
I'm the one who had to throw away the damn time machine.
I've just got to rebuild the time machine, and then I can go back and save Brian!
I have to track down a titanium capacitor for a high-wattage mainframe I'm going to construct.
I know, but the one guy who made those drew a doodle of Mohammed, so he's not around anymore.
He wasn't even doing it on purpose, just absentmindedly while talking on the phone.
Oh, dear, Rupert, without those capacitors, it'll be completely impossible to build a functioning time machine.
I guess that means Brian is really gone for good.
I always wind up getting hit by a black woman with a purse.
Uh, ma'am, what's your relationship to Brian? You bring him to justice!
You make sure this angel child didn't die for nothing!
Oh, boy, this is, um... this is probably the worst pain I've ever had to go through, and I've sprained my ankle twice.
He was smart, he was loyal, and I guess what I'm trying to say is he was like a brother to me.
And I-I'm gonna spend the rest of my life missing him.
Can we at least get rid of the doggie door so Chris doesn't keep getting stuck in it?
You know, I hate to say it, but I-I'm starting to think the only way to stop missing Brian is to get a new dog.
Or do we all get Ghostbuster jumpsuits with our names on them?
I know it might take time to find the right dog, but I really feel like it might be the best way for us to move on.
All right, well, I guess it couldn't hurt to look.
Look, I miss Brian more than any of you, but at least now no one's forcing us to watch those awful PBS documentaries.
So, with the exception of not being able to go out in the sun, you're completely normal?
All right, guys, time to find a new family dog.
I don't know how to choose between all these dogs.
Oh, finally, someone who sounds like they went to college.
Maybe I bring back an iPhone that fell off a truck.
Hey, you guys got a good banging-broads couch, you know that?
You promised me we were all eating my Play-Doh pasta tonight.
I don't know, fat man, I think you're jumping the gun.
I'm mad at this jar of pickles I can't open.
Hey, guys, I want you to meet our new dog, Vinny.
Maybe sometime you could take me on a ride-along with you, show me the neighborhood.
I got to be honest, I can't get a bead on you, man.
Oh, boy, Vinny, hanging out with you has been the best.
Did you just speak ill of the man who busts his tail providing for you?
If this guy thinks he's sticking around, he's sorely mistaken.
I'm going to tell Vinny so much bad news about Italian-Americans that he goes into cardiac arrest.
Hey, Vinny, Bobby Lammaduro's kid just got out of the hospital.
Hey, Doonesbury, how about a joke that ain't for fancy millionaires?
Everyone in this family is so damn thrilled with you, they've forgotten all about Brian.
You're not supposed to lose your best friend at my age.
Look, Stewie, I know it doesn't seem like it now, but you're gonna be okay.
Because, I once had a thing happen to me with some stuff.
You know, before you guys found me at the shop,
It was just him and me in a tiny apartment, and we got pretty tight.
By the time he passed away, it was real tough.
He tried to go to a yoga class, and on the first pose, his ball sack split in half.
Anyway, I guess Leo was kind of like my Brian.
I kind of sensed you were all going through the same feelings of loss that I was.
And it made me think, hey, maybe I was meant to find these guys.
Hey, Stewie, now that we're pals, maybe you can answer me something.
Why does your living room smell so much like puke?
Vinny, my friend, you got a lot of stories to catch up on.
Well, I think the little guy had a long day.
I'll tell Peter to turn off the nightlight this time.
I think I'm gonna sleep in here with Stewie tonight.
Piggy, I don't think Kermie Jr. is doing so well.
Hey, Peter, do you mind if I hang out here a while?
I accidentally made eye contact with a transvestite at a bar, and he followed me home.
Get out of here, you mess! You were far away!
You know you want me! Shut up! Now go home!
So, Quagmire, if you're some kind of big ladies' man, how come I never see you wearing a necklace?
The guy wants to get you a necklace, let him get you a necklace!
Wow, finally, something in my life that makes me feel special.
I mean, except for when I had those cow udders.
So, as you can see, the fiscal projections for the fourth quarter make this thing a slam dunk.
All right, then, looks like we got ourselves a deal.
Okay, what do you got for a lyric? I put a booger on a painting at the museum.
Those things don't work if they get dry and old
Guys, I'm trying to do something up here that works better if I don't hear men singing!
I'd like a sandwich, but I don't feel like eating two whole loaves of bread.
That was beautiful. And it must be original, because I know every song about money, and I've never heard that one before.
Although, I-I don't have as cavalier an attitude toward my debt as the song suggests.
I-I've taken to throwing up in the yard so my wife won't hear me.
Well, you guys have got something special with those harmonies.
They could give me five years salary, tax free, and it wouldn't put a dent in my problem.
I used to have my own record label, Mort Town.
I even managed Earth, Wind, Fire & Pollen for a little while, but I had to give it up.
But it soon all came to a very ugly end.
It was so easy to get your hands on them.
I lost weight, my hair straightened, even my voice changed.
I didn't recognize the man I saw in the mirror.
Anyway, you guys got the talent, but what you need is a manager.
Someone with no talent who can take a lion's share of your earnings.
Hey, do I have time to get a drink at the water fountain where the water does not crest above the dispenser?
Fellow cardholders, please put your hands together for Griffin and Quagmire!
Excuse me, I just want to grab one of those newspapers.
It was very dark, and then I-I heard the footsteps...
The promoters of the New England Music Festival saw it, and they want to book you!
I had no idea you and Quagmire could even sing!
If you randomly stumble upon an amazing talent, and then someone important sees it by wild coincidence, great things can happen without any hard work.
I'm gonna go jump off the roof and see if I can fly!
A singer, huh? You as good as the guys who sing Happy Birthday at Macaroni Grill?
No one has stronger marriages and more well-adjusted kids an rock stars.
Rupert and I are just having a spritzer and some cheese in advance of the performance.
You know, there was a guy on my old block, Johnny Chickstuff.
We called him that because he used to like to, uh...
Anyway, a bunch of us got together and beat him with a grill lid and windshield wipers, and let's just say, uh, he don't do chick stuff no more.
Yeah. He wasn't exactly like us, so we had to almost kill him.
I don't know. Soon thereafter, a girl in the neighborhood married a black guy, so we all kind of turned our attention to that.
And to think, just last week, my only creative outlet was picking hockey fights at work.
Griffin, I need these shipping reports filled out by 5:00 today.
Hey, Peter, I just wanted to wish you good luck.
All right, backstage whore, here's the key to my hotel room.
And I saw a stick of butter and it almost made me shudder
I don't want a giant penis or a rocket trip to Venus
Our company's gonna be around for at least three more weeks, and we want to sign you.
I don't know, it-it seems wrong to just dump Mort.
Quagmire, you remember I told you about that dream I drew?
I think if we do this, we'll get the giraffe.
I may have gotten you booked at a horse's birthday party.
He's the one that got you to where you are today.
Lois, my transcendent talent got me to where I am.
Peter, I don't like what success is doing to you.
Yeah, well, I don't like what time is doing to you.
I emptied this out so it'd be easier to carry.
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to choose between music and family.
If I choose family, does it have to be this family?
Very well, this scavenger hunt will provide you with my answer.
I feel kind of bad leaving the family like this with Thanksgiving coming up.
I mean, if I'm not there, who's gonna carve the turkey?
Why the hell do you brush your teeth at work?
Why the hell do you brush your teeth at work?
Yesterday, I learned the difference between a train and a boat.
I hope it don't fall off the track and I drown
Irregardless of this waitress, I will kill them with a knife.
An acorn in a nest of twigs, and underneath two fetal pigs
Come... Uhp, uhp, it just skipped right over the strings!
Meg, can you please stop stuffing your face for two seconds?
Look, I'm sorry for being a jerk, and letting a little fame go to my head.
So, did you get a lot of trim on the road, Dad?
I was, but then I thought, what was Simon without Garfunkel?
Yeah, but all that success would mean nothing if I lost my best friend.
Well, I'm glad to have you back home for Thanksgiving, Peter.
Yeah. The doorknob was really hot, but I just let go instead of holding onto it.
And there's some ice on the stairs to the basement, so I guess just don't go down there.
You know, the best thing about the Quahog Mall is going into Tiffany's and doing everything possible to make 'em think I might actually buy something.
That's all? A-And how late are you open this evening?
I want to make sure you get credit for this sale.
Oh, and these watches here, if I wanted to get 11 of them for different groomsmen, could they each get engraved individually?
Whoever is responsible for this shall suffer my eternal wrath.
Why don't you go bother the cologne salesman at Macy's?
I want something I can wear on the street that a broad can smell on a fire escape.
Let's ask that security guard who has everything on his belt except a gun.
You're not the only one around here with a small cog.
Of course he is, Lois. I feel the same way.
How come every time I'm feelin' happy, somebody's gotta come along and ruin it?
What if we told you that we secretly replaced your coffee with Folgers Crystals?
'Cause of how you just raved about it just now?
Boy, Stewie was really upset about the Christmas Carnival being canceled.
Ah, I'm sure he'll be over it in no time.
Besides, how much trouble can he cause? He's a baby.
Oh, my God, I left my phone in my car.
Turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy who knows a girl, which is weird because they don't usually know nothin', who says the carnival was canceled by the mall's owner, some guy named Carter Pewterschmidt.
So I got another guy workin' on findin' out who that is.
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna have to Oh this out until I'm not surprised anymore.
Lois, before I get mad at your dad, h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?
Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.
The nerve of your dad, takin' the fun out of Christmas, like some kind of gluten-free Santa.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, there's a man here who says he's the guy whose picture is on all the money.
That's right, and this is my own People magazine from home and not from your waiting room just now, and why did you cancel the Christmas Carnival?
You know what it's like being rich at Christmas, Griffin?
Did you... did you just have your hand in my fish tank?
I am gonna help you find the Christmas spirit so you bring back the carnival.
Can I choose one thing in your office to take home with me?
So you're gonna help your old man find his Christmas spirit again, huh?
Oh, yeah, that sounds real bad, her father don't like Christmas.
My father was drowned to death in a birdbath by an officer of the law.
His will just said, Kick Jimmy in the sack for me. Go, Eagles.
I mean, I know Stewie was disappointed about the carnival, but he'll get over it.
Stewie's first words are gonna be, Why did you kill Christmas?
You know, I know I'm usually all business, but deep down, you know what the thing is that keeps me going more than anything else?
Well, you have your work cut out for you, Peter.
Thought I'd see how you like it when someone breaks into your house and touches all your stuff.
All right, Carter, now, you know what's guaranteed to put you in the holiday mood?
Write a Christmas letter to all your friends and relatives.
And keep in mind, it's traditional to embellish a little bit to make yourself look better. Peter had a great year, and is now starting quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Yeah, who has the time? Keep reading. Chris refurbished a vintage motorcycle, and Stewie can slam-dunk a basketball from a standing start...
Read what it says about you. Lois's father, Carter Pewterschmidt, bought a small stool for his balls.
Now, everyone knows the best way to get the Christmas spirit is to drink a whole lot of thick, frothy eggnog.
Good, now go down to the hotel lobby and check out with nog all over your face.
You know, I still don't like Christmas, but I kind of like what we just did.
Okay, Carter, a big part of Christmas is masturbating like you would any other day but feeling guilty about it because it's Christmas.
I-I'm not getting the holiday spirit, so you can stop trying.
Oh, my God, it's the carolers from A Christmas Story.
You're next up to see the big guy himself and you look like a piece of spaghetti on the street.
I don't know. I thought having the carnival back would make me happy, but it still feels like something's missing.
Like when I finally got to sleep with Mary Lou Gallo.
She had a look, but when you got up close, she also had a smell.
Mall Santa is brought to you in part this season by Chipotle.
It's our first Christmas without him and no one's even mentioned his name.
You want me to put a dead dog under your tree?
We now return to The Year Without a Santa Claus or Sex.
Hey, whose leg do you gotta gagoosh to get an Amaretto Di Saronno around here?
For example, I know Brian was rather into politics, so I read the newspaper.
Yup. Let me read you an expert. You wish you were a millionaire. You want more money. Guess what. You blew it. You wish you could change the neighborhood. You want to be a selectman. You blew it. You wish you could open up a restaurant. You did not want to pay protection money. Knock, knock. Who's there?
You know what the last page of the book is?
A mirror. So you can see exactly who blew it.
Look, I appreciate all this, Vinny, but there's only one Brian, and it's tough for me that he's gone, especially around the holidays.
How about you open up one of those Christmas presents?
Hold on, it could also be they killed Jimmy Tissue Paper Scungili.
To the beach, a wedding on the beach, beach graduation, beach funeral, business conference which could be at a beach, a stroll through the park, should that park be adjacent to a beach.
How's about we go to the mall and pick out something you do like?
All right, I better get out of these professor clothes before I kick my own ass.
I don't know. I hate the toy store this close to Christmas.
What kid wouldn't want to play with these? Baa. What are you lookin' at? Not much, that's what I'm lookin' at. You want to have a go? I'd watch what I say with that other sheep right behind you.
Course, I had to do it with ashtrays, but I think the sheep is better.
Several months ago, I time-traveled ahead to purchase that Christmas toy.
The time machine return pad is in the backpack that other Stewie is wearing.
Vinny, I need you to get that Stewie to take off his backpack.
Trust me, I think I know you well enough to know how to distract the other you.
This may sound a little presumptuous of me, but, uh, you ever do any modeling?
But I feel like that backpack might be hiding some figure flaws.
You know, my friends ask me, Stewie, why do you throw up after every meal?
The other you is in the back changing into a pair of tap shoes, for some reason.
Excellent. Now all I've got to do is set the coordinates to the moment before Brian got killed and I can save him.
You realize if I save Brian, my family won't get another dog, which means we will never have met.
Hey, I'm man's best friend, not some stupid baby's best friend, right?
Okay, Brian, I'm just putting this out there, but I'm a baby and only dicks don't let babies win.
You know, usually, I'd be sitting inside writing, you'd be working on one of your machines.
I was using them for... for, for this other thing.
And when it did, a little part of me died as well.
So I came back from the future to save your life.
Yes, but luckily, I ran into another me from the past, so I stole his return pad and came back here.
Hmm. I'm starting to think that guy wasn't a real modeling agent.
And I'm starting to think that other guy wasn't a real penis-butt inspector.
You know, a whole lot of other families would've just gotten a different dog and moved on.
Oh, oh, we could, we could never do something like that, Brian.
Now you don't have to ask me if everything is hot before you touch it.
Last night, I heard, uh, the song Pour Some Sugar On Me, and-and this question popped into my head.
Are you-- and please say yes-- are you related-- and even if you're not, please say yes-- are you related to-- and please say yes because I need the attention from my friends-- are you related to Def Leppard?
You know, that is one nice thing about having a deaf coworker.
Well, that and I can work on my verbal sound effects and not feel self-conscious about the ones that aren't quite there yet.
That's a helicopter hovering over a woman swimming in her pool.
Griffin, I actually came to tell you that you're being promoted to forklift operator.
Yeah, Frank retired, and since you're already required to wear a helmet here-- which, by the way, put on your helmet.
I guess this means I can afford to set up this cutaway with a fancy new transition.
All right, you beautiful bastard, show me what you got.
Peter, you can run now, and no one will call you a quitter.
I learned how to use stickers, and I can learn how to use this.
Yeah, it was just all the hats you could think of.
Underwear 'cause you're a cat in the laundry basket hat.
Halloween mask that I flip up to eat my candy hat.
You're not allowed to say that unless there's a forklift outside.
Hold on, remember the first thing we said we'd do.
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk
I walk all the time, 'cause my legs can walk.
He needs to get back in the water or he'll die.
Ah, this is what it's all about, huh, Duke? in one big thing.
You know, I always thought I could chug that, but I never tried 'cause I figured I couldn't lift it.
So, as you can see, sales are going very well.
I'd like to pay $1,300 for one month of health insurance.
Now, I know it's picture day, but we can't afford them anymore, so just run behind another kid when they're getting their picture taken.
You know, actually, Peter, there's a lot of job training programs sponsored by the state that could help you get the skills you need for another occupation.
This is the raw material of a picture of life that I'm gonna paint with words.
Yesterday, it took you to lap up a cold cut off the floor.
It's been three weeks and you haven't had a single job lead.
I came really close with that job at the school.
So, what makes you want to be a crossing guard?
I don't know, I just thought it would be cool to decide which kids do and don't get hit by a car.
Well, Peter, since you've been having such a tough time,
I was thinking, maybe I should look for a job.
Lois, I'll be damned if I will let my wife be a prostitute.
Peter, there are jobs for women between prostitute and lawyer.
I guess you should; and that'll give me more time to focus on expanding my record collection.
Oh, yes, when Debussy was young, that's when you want Debussy.
You know this place like the back of your hand.
You're looking at the new assistant store manager of Stop 'N Shop.
You get to see all the food before it's famous.
Well, you know you've made it when you've got a teenage boss.
Now I can spend my days at The Clam like we've always talked about.
No, Peter, if I'm gonna be out of the house working, you're gonna have to take over for me in the house.
Wait, wait, what, I-I got to do what you do?
Spending the whole day taking Tylenol PMs and straddling the bath faucet?
Well, the guy knows what's going on here, I'll give him that.
No, I mean, you're gonna need to cook the meals and do laundry and take care of Stewie, like I've been doing.
I mean, it can't be any harder than that job
Oh, yes, we have a wide selection of balls that are way too heavy or have too-small finger holes.
Uh, no, you will not be able to do anything with your wrist for seven days afterward.
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks in the arcade are completely covered in pizza grease, no worries there.
Oh, absolutely, there is always a group of teenagers throwing the ball real hard and scaring everyone.
No, there is no smoking, but we do let you smoke.
Oh, I can't use the washing machine; it's really been acting up lately.
All right, kids, you are really gonna love these Cornish game hens I cooked for dinner.
Now, I don't want to pat myself on the back, but I worked all day getting 'em just right...
Yeah, well, let's take off our shoes and try to keep it that way, huh?
No, really, Peter, it seems like you've really taken to being a househusband.
I barely had time to put on a nice sweater and clasp a cup of tea with two hands.
And now to tie this sweater around my waist and walk around the neighborhood.
Well, what do you say I reward you for all your hard work?
Why can't you just listen instead of trying to fix everything?!
I don't think we've done it since I started working.
Putting on one of your dress shirts to look sexy.
I want to do it on top of the comforter.
Well, of course you don't, you're not the one who cleans it.
Hey, Peter, you want a little something to put in that orange juice?
Well, I figured you'd like to start your day with a stiff one.
Nothing. Well, you got a dead rat in your pants, mister.
Well, if Peter could try them, they might help with his problem.
Oh, I don't know, Peter, it's getting kind of late.
It takes me three hours to get ready for bed.
Oh, please don't make me go home and disappoint my wife yet again!
You know how earlier tonight we all said we had erections?
You know, Dr. Hartman once told me I had gonorrhea.
So I hit him in the head with a bat.
I tried the pills he gave me, but even they didn't work.
Well, look at it this way, Peter: without sex, you'll have more time to do the things you've always wanted to do.
Why the hell would you want to play the trombone?
I think even the people at the office supply store can tell.
Um, excuse me, where do you keep your three-ring binders?
All right, Peter, now, when it comes to curing impotence, sometimes you have to get creative.
Well, basically, some dirtbag from Boston yells at your junk to scare it into working again.
Listen, I could be nice about this or I could get my brother.
And he did some serious time for throwing a turkey off a bridge into a car.
How could a town with so many great colleges produce nothing but dopes?
Okay, okay, my sex face is a ton of underbite.
Oh, come on, Peter, get out of my water glass.
Oh, sorry, I guess I need to be a little more to the left.
Come on, Quagmire, you were a Navy pilot for six years.
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start having trouble in the bedroom until you lost your job, right?
I mean, you've been completely emasculated because you're no longer the breadwinner.
It was a mistake for me to ever take that promotion.
So, by promoting an incompetent man, you were at fault.
Nice try, but I'm not the one who drove a forklift into a conference room and sent two people to the hospital.
Come on, since this man lost his job, he can't pleasure his wife.
And I could stand here and give you a big speech about second chances and promise to work harder than ever before.
And I could remind you that one day you might be in my shoes and maybe you'll need a second chance.
I'm gonna cash in this coupon you gave me last Valentine's Day. One Redo For Being Fired For Gross Negligence. And One Hug.
Oh, I hired a studio audience to do your old job.
Peter, I can't help you shake DVDs out of the Redbox again.
You don't have to anymore, because I got my old job back.
No. I am gonna do you right here on a stack of pita bread.
We now return to An Early Draft of A Streetcar Named Desire.
It was nice of the manager not to call the cops.
I can't remember if I'm supposed to sleep on my stomach or my back.
Or are you worried about what happened to that family down the street?
Those three guys broke in, beat up the father with a croquet mallet, and then stole the baby, and nobody knows where the baby is now?
Now, that title could be a fairy tale or a porn.
You know, if you could spin straw into gold or-or maybe meth, I wouldn't need a job.
What? I-I'd never even freaking heard of magic beans till you said them.
If I do get them, it's you what caused it.
She wants her stupid magic beans so the whole world has to stop.
But nobody can cross my bridge without paying a toll.
You have to name three great Jewish athletes or pay a thousand gold coins.
Took gold in Athens in 2000 and the bronze in Atlanta in '96.
Oh, come on, I'm supposed to go into town and sell this cow.
I don't have much, but I'll give you some magic beans for it.
Look, le-let's just admit we both kind of got our wires crossed, and commit to being clearer in the future.
Like when you were supposed to be babysitting Georgie Porgie and his sleazy brother Rick Porgie.
Hey, Rick, you want to kiss some girls and make them cry?
What the hell are we supposed to do with these anyway?
I knew you'd be mad, so I've asked the band Heart to explain these beans in a way you can dreamily digest.
I-I was hoping they'd change a few more words to pertain to our situation, but I-I-I'm just happy they did this.
Tomorrow I want you to go back out there and look for a job that pays actual money.
I know she's gone, but can you do the other one?
Don't you want someone to care about you? Mary Davis gives birth to... lamb?
I think those magic beans grew into a giant beanstalk.
Ah, damn it! I need to see that so I can make curds and whey.
My old gym coach is over there with a whistle.
And now to throw this handful of change down because I'm a psychopath.
This is probably what famous black rappers eat for breakfast.
It's odd that you would speak gibberish of your own choosing and not make it rhyme.
That is not what happened. H-He's out of his mind.
He just sits in his room all day and inhales hair spray.
All right, we're just gonna have to quietly run away.
Our sexual troubles are still... are still very much alive.
So, the lesson there is if you steal, you better be ready to murder, too.
Wow, you got a great view into Bonnie's window from here.
So I got out of the car to take a leak, because I'd been drinking, and I didn't know it was next to a children's park.
But anyway, that's why this lady has to watch whenever I play with you.
All right, the next story is Little Red Riding Hood.
Red Riding Hood was choosing her clothes for a journey across the forest.
Wh-why are you putting a bag of ice in here?
If you're gonna hit the king, you better kill the king.
So, um, what happened with you and those three little pigs?
First of all, I didn't want to eat them, all right?
Well, she was my ex-girlfriend, and I believed I was due an explanation about why she was such a  whore.
All right, well, I'm off to my grandmother's, but before I go, I better take a deep-woods dump.
I got to go check on my shoe apartment complex.
I'm gonna rent this place to Goldilocks and the three bears.
I'm the one who's about to get violently bisected by the woodsman.
You know, I'm not sure if that's our hero or just a lunatic going house to house murdering people.
Now, if this don't get you to sleep, nothing will. Cinderella by nobody remembers.
A long time ago, in a magical, faraway land, several women lived together and, surprise, surprise, they didn't exactly get along.
God, we have so few female characters to work with.
You just keep scrubbing that poo spot so I can come back and poo on that spot again.
You guys are gonna regret being mean to me someday.
Remember the time you told King Midas to go to third base with me?
Yeah, I mean, you'd be evil, too, if your stepdad was Bruce Jenner.
Well, I don't, I don't know what that was, but th-the first one has a parchment from the Charmings.
I hear he's looking for someone to spend the rest of his life with.
Oh, you know, I-I have an eye for fashion, and I'm pretty good with my hands.
Girls, shred her dress and divvy it up for monthlies.
And then they ripped up my dress so now I have nothing to wear.
Cinderella, I am your fairy godmother. Fairy in the magical sense, not about kissing guys.
I want that bitch Snow White to just admit she had an abortion.
I was thinking more like a new dress for the party.
All these royal types are inbreeding, walleyed, bucktooth monsters who have to be wheeled around under a blanket.
These are my daughters, and they will do anything to be your princess, right, girls?
But stick around in case I don't find anyone else.
And you smell slightly less worse than everyone else in the kingdom.
Now I'll never get to be a rich, do-nothing wife.
My lord, there is no sign of her, and we searched far.
You got to search wide, that's like half of it.
And so the prince searched all over the kingdom for the foot that fit the glass slipper.
He skipped the, uh, south side of town, which, uh, even in fairy tale times, was, um... let's just say loud.
And so, whoever fits in this slipper will be my princess.
I can't wait to make love to you a hundred years before the invention of toilet paper.
And so, two people who danced together one time entered into an ill-advised, long-term relationship.
And they lived happily ever after for seven months and then separated with the goal of fixing themselves and getting back together.
They got into a huge fight when his mom got sick.
And now they don't even follow each other on Twitter.
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad that all the-the animals are so spread out, you know?
I mean, wouldn't it be awesome if-if they were all grouped together, like in a cafeteria, and you could just go in there with a trench coat and just waste them?
Well, maybe I can stir up some quail or pheasant with my patented bird calls.
I'm a bird of the opposite sex who's interested in mating!
Well, you want me to pull the trigger and prove it to you?
No, I just want to make sure your safety's on.
No, the dumbest thing I ever did was open that can of whup-ass.
A writer who inherits a magic typewriter that writes for him, but then it turns out the typewriter is... racist?
Yeah, I-I decided to step away from the whole situation.
The last thing he needs is a father who's, you know, sometimes there, sometimes not.
Hey, if I click ignore, will he know that I'm sending him to voice mail?
I know we haven't talked in a while, but I'm calling because I'm on my way to Quahog.
You're gonna go to that lunch, you're gonna reconnect with your son.
I mean, I'm the guy who told Michael Chiklis to wear tight shirts.
I'll tell you anything you want, just get your boob out of my face!
No matter how muscular I get, I will never be muscular.
Did you hurt your arm after I shot you in the arm?
Look, I already said I was sorry, like, a hundred times.
Oh, and before I forget, I want my Huey Lewis CD back.
I can't give it back. I lost it in a poker game.
Where the hell do you get off betting my CD in a poker game?
No, no, Joe, Joe, Joe, it's time somebody said this to him.
You can't even walk and chew gum at the same time.
Coming up, we'll meet a Filipino man who actually has a grown-up haircut.
And I haven't seen him in years, and at this point, I-I just don't see what could possibly be gained from me getting together with him.
In entertainment news, Hollywood comes to Quahog in the form of a new Disney Channel show called Parent Boppers, about a group of teen detectives.
The show, set and filmed right here in Rhode Island, stars local teen and Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.
Boy, little did I know how much that was gonna rub off.
It's-it's almost like the universe is trying to I don't know, make us work together or something, I don't know.
Hey, hey, don't put the universe's words in my mouth, okay?
So, what better way to reconnect than by working together every day?
Well, I suppose I could talk to them, see if they'd go for it.
I-I mean, it wouldn't be the craziest idea in show business.
I want to stick my head through a circle at the beginning of movies and roar.
We now return to Saving Private Ryan, brought to you without commercial interruption by Mazda.
Jerome, can you tell that to  get the hell out of here before I kick him in the face?
Peter, why don't you just sit in that booth over there?
Joe, I got a box of salt water taffies, and you can have two.
Joe, I got a deck of cards you can put in your wheels to look cool.
You made me dribble on my Bruno Maglis turning to see who's calling my name!
Oh, you don't know who Joe Pesci is, 'cause you're 14.
You see, in the '90s, this was a tough guy.
Hey, multiracial group of friends, you want to hang out?
Tell my assistant I fell asleep with a condom on again, and to bring scissors to my trailer.
I want to introduce our newest staff writer, Brian Griffin.
You probably have my novel, but just so you know, in here,
Okay, so we got to come up with a story for next week's episode.
How about we do one where DJ gets his driver's license?
Let me ask you something: are you afraid right now?
Are you saying my nine-year-old daughter wants to be raped?
Take what you think you know and go a different way with it.
Like-like, for instance, what if the daughter in Taken was Zooey Deschanel?
Peter, Quagmire, I've called you here today because this has got to stop.
The petty vying for my attention, the late-night phone calls, the attack ads.
But would a good friend not return a leaf blower for four months during the leafy season?
I'm Peter Griffin, and I broke into a news station to make this.
I'm sorry, Peter, it's just that Quagmire's been there for me in some pretty dark days.
My stupid parents want me to wear a bike helmet.
Hold on, other kids. Maybe they just recognize that nothing can protect us from the tedium of our mundane lives.
Sometimes I just want to put this gun in my mouth.
Yesterday, you had Dakota give herself an abdomen-punch abortion during her volleyball tournament.
Oh, come on! You can't fire a writer in the middle of a show!
That would be like a doctor leaving in the middle of a surgery!
Okay, Josh, this is the shot you've been waiting for.
Okay, Derek, this is the shot you've been waiting for.
Dad, believe me, I want you to work here with me, but you can't keep doing things like that.
And they know you took those cases of Diet Coke home last night.
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all getting those backpacks with the name of the show on them?
I'm starting to think that you've just been using me to advance your career!
Stewie, I just feel so awful about what happened with Dylan.
I mean, every terrible thing he said about me is true.
I think being a paid writer again just went to my head.
I mean, I just... I can't believe I was so selfish.
It's-it's like Dylan just held a mirror up to me, and I could finally see how poorly I'd been treating him.
I guess I didn't realize how lucky I was to have Dylan back in my life until I lost him all over again.
I mean, he knows that I'm sorry and that I'm sad.
I think you've got to get down to that set and apologize face-to-face.
I just... I hope he's willing to hear me out, you know?
Sorry, Brian, Dylan says he doesn't want to see you anymore.
Yeah, you know, you probably would've had a better shot if you hadn't yelled For this!
You know, that-that kind of telegraphed what you were gonna do.
Well, maybe you can't get in, but I think I know someone who can.
British upper class, British Cockney. What, Govnah? Somebody gonna stop me?
We now return to The Love Boat with Somali Pirates.
Well, okay, but that means you're in charge of getting Mr. Devlin to admit that after 30 years, he still loves Mrs. Devlin very much.
Well, maybe not where you come from, but here on the Love Boat...
Hey, Lois, if I was gonna kill myself, do I slit my wrists this way or this way?
So I'm gonna kill myself and get a full page in the yearbook.
In this scene, DJ Slopes is thinking of quitting the detective agency, and you're like, No way.
Listen, Tevin, I think I just need more time to focus on my snowboarding and Web series about energy drinks.
No, man, you got to stay in the detective agency.
It's like you held a mirror up to him and he could finally see how poorly he'd been treating you.
Stay on me, camera one. ...to have you back in his life, and now he feels like he's lost you all over again.
But how do I know he won't just hurt me again?
But isn't taking a risk better than not having a dad?
You know, I don't know where any of that came from, but I liked it.
It's-it's my mom and dad's house, but I don't know the address!
All right, Quagmire, I have given this a lot of thought.
I need you to shoot me in the arm so we can be friends again.
No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture.
No, Peter. I'm gonna shoot you like a dirty animal.
But-but just the fact that I would make the offer is so meaningful to you.
The only thing that means anything to me is a bullet in your arm. Now give me that!
Look, I was trying to do the decent thing, like you'd see in a movie!
Wait a second. All right, then I get to shoot Joe, all right?
He shot me! I mean, if we're doing things fair here, then...
I went to your house, and Chris told me you'd be here.
I've been a really bad father, like Ernest Hemmingway or-or some other great writer.
Peter, I'm so glad you patched things up with your friends.
See, they took all these colors and they're making 'em all live together in a beach house.
Now the red one is sleeping with the green one.
And the blue one thinks he's gonna have a career in music.
Peter, that's just a channel that's gone off the air.
And we'll be right back with more Color Bar Beach House after these messages.
Peter, for God's sake, did you eat this entire roll of raw cookie dough?
You can't just eat raw food out of the fridge.
Just look at the original design for the first hybrid car.
So, as you can see, our quarterly output is up one and a half percent.
Stupid boring meeting. I don't even want to be here.
Ah, man, I think that cookie dough is fighting that taco
I just hope I can hold it in until the meeting's over.
And now, 23 minutes of silence for the 23 workers who drowned in the vats this year.
This was supposed to be and there's kind of a lot of conversation going on.
I wanted to be remembered for my achievement in film.
I'm sure you also heard that someone walked into my office while I was sucking on my own toes.
And do I go fast-walking in nurse's shoes every Saturday in the park?
Somebody saw me holding hands with a guy at Quiznos this morning.
All right, and was I involved in the Oklahoma City bombing?
Yeah, I was swindled by that cat who said he was from the future.
Turns out he was just a present-day cat with a smooth sales pitch.
I understand I've made hundreds of deadly enemies by shouting racial taunts up at the jailhouse windows.
Oh, and another thing, raise your hand if you think ducks are magic.
A-And no, none of us heard about you soiling yourself at work.
All right, well, I'm gonna go confuse everyone on Facebook with a, So sad, terrible day status and nothing more.
And I can't believe this funeral home has a skylight with a sinister clown staring down at us.
Here to say a few words about Thelma is her son, Peter.
My mother always hoped to be buried with her pet cat, Mittens, so I'd like to thank the Quahog Veterinary Society for putting Mittens down so quickly.
No? None? They don't have to be about my mom.
Is anyone else here watching Revolution and wanting to talk about it after this?
This is tragic, but will also open a door for me.
We don't have any rocks to make you stronger here, but welcome.
You're where I was 17 years ago, when I lost my husband, Walter.
Yeah... a-and maybe she can be my new mom, you know, just like Greg Evigan and Paul Reiser were briefly my two dads.
Can you just be Jew Dad and you'll be Earring Dad?
It's hard enough to sleep in here without my memory foam pillow.
The world is full of people who can't accept death.
And they've all got their own ideas of what happens when we die.
Geez, you know, I gotta say, it's weird to see you so worked up about this.
Ever since he violated the section of his lease that doesn't allow subletters.
Wow, every brick in this place is named after someone.
So that side of the building was donated by someone named, Get Out of Our Town?
No, I-I-I think that was the work of some shaved-headed gentleman, but, but we're here to talk about Judaism.
So, where do they think they go when they die?
Although, I should warn you, you might not get an answer.
So, where do Jewish people think they go when they die?
I-I just, I just really want to know what happens.
I think your whole religion is a sham, just so you can get extra holidays off from work.
Buddhism is an Asian religion that also has a significant following of annoying white people.
See, these guys believe that after you die, you're reincarnated and you come back as a pig or a cow or a rooster.
I already know what noises to make if I'm one of those.
But they also don't believe in demonstrating emotions either way, so they're the worst people to buy birthday gifts for.
I know you've been having trouble getting around, so I bought you a new Lexus.
Now, the Catholics believe that as long as you accept Jesus before you die, anyone can get into Heaven.
Peter, thank you so much for your help in making this cake, but don't you think it would be easier if you stood on the floor?
Another memory is my Uncle Roy putting his thumb in me.
God, you know, Evelyn, you've really helped me through a tough time.
I haven't been this grateful since I met the Sane Hatter.
Excuse me. How do I get back through the looking glass?
Oh, yeah, take two lefts and it's the first door on your right.
I-I asked that guy over there, but he just told me a bunch of rhyming nonsense.
Sorry, I stole that from the Italian family next door.
Yeah, sure, just let me just go check my room full of gold and jewels.
You see, every first thing he says is not the real thing.
Well, I just think it's pretty clear that we're all just bags of bones and flesh that eventually break down and decay into worm food.
You know, instead of drawing on your eyebrows, maybe just go without eyebrows.
She let me drive a little bit on the way home.
Yeah, I just remembered, I gotta get the hell out of here.
You know, Evelyn, I am having such a good time with you.
There were still crumbs in the corners of her mouth from that Nilla Wafer she had at lunch.
Well, then you should go talk to her and try to clear this up.
I mean, this wouldn't be the first time you thought someone was hitting on you.
Well, I'm not dead, but I do have a boner.
Don't you hate how the heart is right about here?
All right, Rupert, the old toaster in the tub never fails.
Oh, damn, I wanted to die, not turn into Toaster Man.
While he's getting all the glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left to clean up the crumbs.
I'm afraid my new medicine made me act foolishly yesterday.
I'm probably gonna be a little down until I use the spray again.
Evelyn, I think it's best that we don't see each other anymore.
No, Evelyn, I trusted you, and all this funny business keeps happening, and I don't think it's your medicine at all.
Want to come over to my place and help me move?
Yeah. You know, this isn't a whole lot of stuff.
He's doing his taxes! What's it look like he's doing?
You said it yourself, when we die, there's nothing! We just rot in the ground!
Well, if life has no purpose, why not just cut to the chase?
Look, Stewie, I know you're worried, but you can't live your life being scared of death.
Nobody knows what comes next, so all we can do is pack the most we can into each day we've got.
So for you, that's taking a 45-minute shaky-leg poop on the front lawn?
I'm just saying there's something to be said for living in the moment.
You know, ever since you turned into a rock with your name on it, your friend's been really inappropriate with me.
It's just that since my beloved Walter died, you're the first man who's paid any attention to me, and I guess I took advantage of that.
I guess maybe it's a little bit my fault, too.
I missed my mom so much, and I guess maybe I sort of used you as a replacement.
Ah. Nothing better than a 7:00 a.m. beer in an unbrushed mouth.
Lois, I know how many beers I can drink and still be able to drive.
When a black man finds a barber, it's for life.
No! No! No! I don't want to be promoted that way!
I want to be promoted the shooting-hawks with-a-crossbow way. The NFL experience.
Except for getting all my cutaway gags ready for the week.
Okay, my Great-Uncle-wears a-ski-hat-all-the-time Griffin will be followed by Nick Nolte's handkerchief, followed by Japanese Abe Lincoln, and then monkey rabbi.
Here's your Torah. You be here on Tuesday at 9:00.
There you are. We're gonna need you guys all week.
Rules? What are the rules? How do you make points?
Okay, okay, shorthand lingo. I like it. I like it.
Now, I see some elements of Red Rover with a little bit of spud mixed in.
And is anyone ever going to blow a raspberry on the quarterback's belly?
And it looks like Williams is pulling up his shirt and having a little fun with his tummy!
When two drunk guys, each holding a baby, get into a fistfight.
They're gonna put their cigarettes in their mouths and bump boobs.
And now here comes security to kick out the wrong person.
With a five-point lead and only ten seconds left, all the Patriots have to do is kneel down with the ball, and the game is... Oh, my God, it's a fumble!
It's picked up by the Bills, and they're gonna score the game-winning touchdown!
Yeah, like that one where I walk into the bank, and I ain't got no clothes on.
Sir, what are you doing? You have no clothes on.
We now return to Turner Classic Movies' presentation of John Wayne's final Western, Big Bill Doyle.
Big Bill, two men got off the 2:40 from Amarillo.
John Wayne only ate beef and coffee for every meal, so the director had to shoot around the fact that he was on the toilet all the time.
You know, I am gonna channel this anger into something useful.
It's been four years since I went to the beach!
Well, we just gelled as a team today, and was fortunate to come away with the win.
I'd like to thank God and a jury of my peers, who are both responsible for me being able to play today.
Come on, don't you notice that whenever the Patriots lose, the other team always thanks God?
We got to find God and tell him to cut the crap.
How many times is God gonna ruin our Sunday with both church and bad football?
It's time someone told God to stay where He belongs-- in our schools, and-and telling people where they can stick their wieners.
Well, Lois, the guys and I are off to find God.
There's 500 old grocery bags neatly folded and crammed into one of our cabinets.
Peter, the idea of God, let alone that he'd care anything about football, is absurd.
Well, it's absurd to think that my hand scratching on the couch is some kind of animal, but you do.
Okay, this is God's house, so we'll just go in there, talk to Him, and take care of this whole thing.
I want to enter the church like Sherman Hemsley in Amen.
Huh. God's all over this Bible, but they never give you an exact address.
I saw this article in the paper today. First Headline Read Aloud Often Incorrect.
Oh. Carrie Underwood Credits Her Success to Personal Relationship With God.
And you know it's huge 'cause it's on a Tuesday night.
Hey, in that song, Jesus, Take the Wheel, was that, like, the real Jesus, or was it just some Mexican guy?
He's in our hearts, and we take Him with us wherever we go.
Look, you guys, I don't know who you are, but I have to go perform.
Hey, you know I don't like you talking to other guys.
Give me 40 bucks. I want to get a Toby Keith hat.
You sure you don't want to stay for the show?
We are proud to present Mozart's The Magic Flute... in A minor.
And you still won't give us an Emmy? Come on!
If Modern Family did that joke, you'd be carrying 'em around on your shoulders!
All right, look, maybe I'm not like other football fans, but I don't have a fulfilling career and a rich family life.
Even if it means travelling to the ends of the Earth.
Guys, guys, finding the cheese is what they want us to do.
I don't know where they're getting all this weed. In Greece, it was commonly held that one could speak to the gods from the top of Mount Olympus.
Quick, Peter, say something so he thinks you know what he's talking about.
All right, what better place to find God than the birthplace of all of Western civilization's great religions and one really mean one.
I had a feeling this is what this place would be like.
Oh, God, it's so hot out. Why is there never any parking downtown?
Who gets married on a Tuesday? I got to get off these bad feet.
Yeah, plus I left my Jacuzzi on the whole time, came home to a boiled raccoon.
I'm sorry I dragged you around the world looking for God.
Yeah. Then we hit the tables. I'm already down 30 bucks.
And then the strip club. Guys, we have a 7:00 a.m. tee time.
And are we just gonna bail on the Hoover Dam?
Aw, Death, we really appreciate you taking us to see God.
I was supposed to kill Russell Brand, but I'll just do this instead.
Well, we don't provide towels; you have to bring your own.
You know, I actually can't believe they let me into Heaven.
They won't even let me umpire little league games anymore.
And, Ricky, you have got the best ass on this field.
Look, God, the reason we're here is we wanted to tell you to stop messing with the Patriots!
You really think I'd get involved with football games when there's people dying in Africa?
Are you gonna do something about the people dying in Africa?
You don't, like, pay attention to how much each individual tips at each meal, right?
Look, look, God, why... why you got to hurt Patriots fans?
These are good, drunk people who work hard to get absolutely nowhere in life.
There are three million fishermen and only seven fish left in the sea.
But they live to watch football, many of them still on Zenith or Sylvania television sets.
I gave that guy three Super Bowls, and he never smiled once.
If you make Belichick smile, I'll let the Patriots win again.
Don't worry, I got a lot of practice making people smile.
And your mommy said that she'll be able to Skype at 8:30 if drinks don't turn into dinner.
And if there's one thing that always gets me to smile, it's a child's laughter.
So, I found this kid in the parking lot, and I'm gonna make him laugh for you.
All right, Coach, another surefire equation for comedy is tragedy plus time.
All right, Coach, now one thing that's always funny is when I dub my voice over animal footage and introduce human foibles into their situations.
Look, you guys have been following me around all day making fools out of yourselves.
Our friend Joe here has to have his fluids changed every 72 hours, or else he swells up and his eyes turn yellow.
Uh, every morning, I wake up drenched in my own urine.
My feet are just shoes sewn to the bottom of my pants.
Last week, the handicapped seat on the bus was taken, so they put me on the front, like a bicycle.
After I injured my legs, my doctor said I'd be walking again in two weeks.
Aw, man, this is my biggest accomplishment since my 1920s solo flight across the Atlantic.
All right, we got to put toilets in these things if we're gonna be in 'em for more than two hours.
Well, Peter, I'm glad you're home, and I'm happy you guys found what you were looking for.
Yeah, and this trip made me realize that 98% of the world is just making each other blankets.
So, Brian, you still an atheist now that Dad's met God?
Every time we go to Disney World, he thinks Mickey Mouse just happened to be there that day.
I'll tell ya, seeing God in Heaven was just like that time
But, Peter, I still don't understand why you would go to all that trouble to find God and only ask about the Patriots.
The Travel Channel presents, Backpacking Through Europe with a Bowlegged Man in Short Shorts.
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Aw, Chris, I was just lying to you so you'd go away.
But, if you leave me alone now, I'll give you a billion dollars.
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Hey, call that beeping cart that carries around the fat black people.
Well, I guess Babs has her work cut out for her.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
So, are you gonna go take care of him, Mom?
I can't go. I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Peter, i-is there anything you want to say to me?
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
However, in my defense, she had recently gotten her hair done differently.
I was actually thinking that maybe you could go help Daddy.
I beat him at checkers and he punched one of my hogans.
I better check on my hairless twin in the storm shed.
Yes. Keep being good and all the eggshells and coffee grounds will be yours.
Why doesn't Dad ever want to spend time with me?
You know, Chris, you've got a grandpa who could use your help right now.
That would be a severe black mark on my record as a mom.
Oh, I'd have to make up stories of a severe mental illness.
Make is seem a miracle you made it this long.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
And the worst part about it, is I can't have sex.
God! I wish there was a way I could just do it myself.
You know, just-just to be done and napping within four minutes.
So-So you can do that like, wh-what, once a year or something?
No. You can do it basically whenever you're not doing something else.
Hey, next time I want to try it with my hand.
Wow, he's really fast. Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
Yes. Your money is in this pile of mashed potatoes.
This is fun, Chris. I like hanging out with you.
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
Remember, this is about writing music that means something to us!
No! No one wants to hear your stupid songs about nothing!
Now, let's play I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar.
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal. Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
I just like getting to spend time with my grandpa, you know?
When I make my elbow like this, it looks like women's private parts!
Oh, Chris! You just have a way of looking at things that's delightfully fresh!
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
I promise she'll be dead before I am. I promise.
Peter, that wasn't your will, that was your birth certificate.
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
Well, there are just so many that do such great work.
What the hell? I can't believe your dad's giving all his cash to Chris!
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
Anyway, I don't plan on losing out on any of that money.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
I'm talking about brownnosing Chris and getting on his good side perk.
Okay, my bad. But I've been counting on that money, Lois.
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
I don't know. I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay. Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub, fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
MAN (on TV): We now return to the director's cut of Mission: Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
You're coming with me because I'm definitely over six feet, and you're not handsome.
Hey, Chris, hey, you remember that kid you said was bullying you at school?
I thought he was trying to defend himself with terrible karate.
Chris, I want to share with you a timeworn father/son tradition.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
Flat with a decent face was the best we could hope for back then.
Miley Cyrus had sex with a foam finger at, like, 6:00 p.m. Central Time.
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
With Two Guys Who Watch the Films On Their iPhones.
Good evening. First off, we're going to review Paul Greengrass' Captain Phillips.
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
When we come back, the guys will review American Hustle.
Ugh, I am. I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
Well, Carter kind of decided he's gonna leave all his money to Chris.
So, I've been trying to get on his good side.
I even cleaned his room for him the other day.
I... I don't have the parenting skills necessary to deal with this.
You know what? I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Yeah, or lucky guy, if he ends up being gay.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, I want to take this to the next level.
What?! Is it even legal for a man to marry his son?
As long as it's a man and a man, anything goes up there.
No, no, no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.
And besides, there's plenty of people who are married and don't have sex.
It's time to settle down and simplify things, like maybe having one ATM card and one bank account.
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Well, the best marriages give each other space, but, yes, Chris.
It's a petition to force that hot mom to wear something appropriate at PTA meetings.
Wow. I'm surprised you got fooled by a bear in a wig.
Because, Chris, it takes time to plan a perfect wedding.
You know, like when you respond to a text too quickly.
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
All right, we'll start with the nine grand in copper-bottom cookware.
Hey, I may be your husband and your dad, but I'm still a man.
Excellent. Do you have a table for the couple that barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely. Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure. And maybe they could go next to the vastly-underdressed cousin who thinks the world revolves around him?
Indeed. And we'd like to have him walk through a maze of chair legs.
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever, Stars And Stripes Forever by John Philip Sousa.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.
Yeah, and I bet you're especially happy we're getting married on a Thursday.
Welcome, friends, loved ones, and people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time with nothing better to do.
I understand the two of you have written your own vows?
I turn to the words of the only poet that blue collar,
New England scumbags like me know: Robert Frost. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Peter, several people have called the police about a man marrying his son.
Is everyone from your past here to walk you down the aisle?!
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.
I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.
Wait. You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?
I'm gonna make it up to you, starting right now.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
He was with another dad. I was with another son.
Hey, thanks for fitting in the ride to school in between your texts.
You know, that was a stroller, not a speed bump.
I'll know they're bullies if they use my full name.
Well, I have officially seen every video ever on YouTube.
How come she always skips out when there's work to do?
That... I mean, there's no reason that that's weird, but it-it-it is weird, right?
Wait, so you mean to tell me, if I ever want to get out of something, all I got to do is take a smoke break?
Wow, I can use smoking to get out of anything.
Finally, I'm above the law like my 14th century ancestor
Come here! Hurry! Run! But the very far-away doctor couldn't make it in time.
And that's why here in Denmark we have very small tables.
Well, this is how Scott Caan was raised, and he turned out okay.
Hey, Dad, want to hear a story about my day at school?
Then she left and I realized I was all alone...
You put them in there, and they swim like hell for, like, 30 seconds, and then they go to sleep.
You know, the way those kids were picking on you today in school.
What would you say if I said, Hey there, shorty?
Oh, Stewie, I-I could never come up with stuff like you do.
But even you could learn enough to outsmart those cretins at your school.
We're a team and we've got to look out for each other.
Now, what are you gonna call the one in the middle?
Here, put me on your back and repeat what I say.
I heard you were born out of your mom's butt.
I heard that from your mom while I was doing her.
I can't believe I'm moving tomorrow, and I won't get to see how this works out.
The intruder has tracked in a red clay, which can only be found near London's homosexual bathhouse.
You know, Peter, it's so nice that after all these years we've been together, we can still... Smoke break!
I just need a couple every hour or so, so I don't go completely insane.
Your father got up early and went for a run.
Ah, nothing like an after-run mint to get rid of that jogger's breath.
Ah, nothing like an after-paper mint to get rid of that paper-getting breath.
You know, I feel like these waffles could use a little fresh air. Come on, boys.
Oh, Meg's out of milk. I'll get you a carton.
I know it's technically not illegal, but it seemed wrong when your music teacher wrapped a trash bag around his waist so he could change pants.
Passover's stupid and I'm gonna prove it by breaking your nose.
Why don't you pick on someone your own religion who can fight for themselves?
You frequently opt out of swim class because of your gross microcephalic penis.
Hey, Chris, what you did there for that sweaty Jew?
Uh... I mean... you have a-a vulva... and fallopian tubes.
Well, you know, at first it was a way to get out of work, but then I discovered it's a delightful habit that has lots of benefits. Yeah? Like what?
Like I get to punctuate tough conversations by ashing a cigarette.
God, there's, like, no one hot at this school this year.
First off, we have a new rule: no more asking the gym teachers if they went to college.
As of now, we have the perpetually upbeat black kid running unopposed.
Come on, yo, this is gonna be a great year for all of us!
Surely there's another student who'd like to throw his hat in the ring.
Mr. Griffin, I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions.
Do you think I can jump and touch that pipe up there?
Dr. Hartman, we're here for you to help Peter quit smoking.
I can't even get my son to quit being gay.
All right, how many Vicodins for you guys to just leave me alone?
I guess we should go to the Stop Smoking Clinic and then maybe get a couple bottles of wine.
Oh, all right. Then give me the good news first.
The good news is, I've taught you everything you need to know to fend for yourself.
So from now on, you can go to school without me.
You're coming to school with me whether you like it or not!
Let me out! You can't keep me in here forever!
I'll never get to express disappointment with young people while putting in my dentures!
Back in my day, we had Katy Perry, Justin Bieber.
Lois, why do all the people in here look like Emperor Palpatine?
Would the driver of a 1978 Camaro please move your car?
Excuse me, I'm Mr. Stone with the ad agency of Anderson, Wheeler and Thirdname.
And I think you'd be perfect for our new anti-smoking campaign.
There is one catch: if you're gonna be our spokesman, you have to keep smoking.
You got it. So, um, does somethin' like this pay a lot of money?
Oh, hey, hey, guys! Here comes one of my TV spots!
Hey, Peter, now that you're a celebrity, could I get a picture of you to put on the wall?
I'll put you up next to these black celebrities who are just confusing strangers to you.
Peter, I saw your ad on TV, and I got to say,
Hey, if George Michael doesn't have to give up butts, why should I?
It's not like you have to look at my face when we have sex.
Wow, isn't it weird that we both picked Mario Lopez?
Yeah, it shows that we both go Latino but soft Latino.
Feces and the buildup thereof continues to be my number one problem.
I think a teacher saw me the other day but said nothing.
This could be my chance to escape this canvas cage!
That sounds like an open door. Which way is out?
Oh, hey, uh, you know, I don't know if you're the guy to talk to about this, but when I went to my trailer this morning, there was a hairy naked guy in it.
I'm sorry to tell you this, but we no longer need your services.
Well, I went to a NASCAR event and realized you're just an average-looking man.
Come on. Let's go kidnap my neighbor's dog and tell them we don't have it.
First of all, I don't care what the courts say, let's thank the Christian god together.
Now then, we're here today for the presidential candidate debate.
So it's got to be clever and it's got to pop.
All right, let's begin with an opening statement from the perpetually upbeat black kid.
You were being bullied day in and day out, so I tried to help you.
And now an opening statement from our second candidate, the King of the Zingers, Chris Griffin.
Well, I may no longer be on your back, but I'll always be on your side.
All right, this election is postponed. Go back to class.
Oh, and another thing, stop making fun of teachers who don't have cars.
Life's not as easy as you think it's gonna be right now.
You know, Chris, what you did on that stage took a lot of guts.
I guess we put those bullies in their place, huh?
Well, I finally quit smoking and I'm ready to go back to normal!
Yeah, Lois is right. As bad as you look, the damage you've done to your heart and your lungs is, no doubt, exponentially worse. What?!
It must've been around 1979 when Animal started snorting crushed-up pieces of felt.
He, like, threw me down and he said, I hope your puppeteer has big hands, because I'm not using lube.
But if you squint and imagine it says Peter Griffin, it says Peter Griffin.
Or do I open it up and see if it contains He-Mans?
You know, Lois, physicists believe there are two alternate universes: one in which I don't open the box and one in which I do.
Wow, I haven't felt this powerful since I got to decide which ant lives and which ant dies.
You shall battle to the death, and the winner will be given his freedom.
I told you not to play God with those ants!
Thanks. That was way too much heat on my neck.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up that Peter has a whip, because, well, you know, given your racial heritage, it seems like something you might want to keep an eye out for.
I know this is very risky, but the upside is so good, I'm taking it.
He thinks no one will notice he got his neck done.
Oh, they're-they're just becoming blood brothers. Blood brothers? What the devil is that?
Well, it's an ancient ritual where two friends intermingle their blood, thus sealing a bond even deeper than friendship.
I am going to be the cutest fire hydrant in the whole... Aah! What are you doing?!
Hey, are-are you blood brothers with Meg because you ate her tampon out of the trash?
Uh, hey, listen, this is, uh, a little awkward, but, uh, you guys are sitting in our booth.
Nice try, wheelie, but this ain't your booth no more.
That's right, we see you losers anywhere near this booth, and we'll bust your kneecap.
All right, I was hoping it wouldn't have to come to this, but... you fellas are in big trouble.
If, uh... if you could just move back like eight feet.
All right, I'll just strangle him with this Hawaiian shirt.
All right, bitches, either you tuck your little wangs between your legs and waddle out of here or we're gonna beat the crap out of you.
And now I have some very uncomfortable phone calls to make.
I'm gonna need you to take me off speakerphone for this.
You knew you had herpes, and-and you still agreed to swap blood with me!
It's a disgusting, unsightly, unsavory disease, and it lasts for life!
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, isn't the worst thing about herpes just the stigma?
You know, my uncle was in the Army, and he got genital boppo from a Saigon whore...
And on the same day I'm supposed to help with my friend's wedding invitations.
So, I was thinking, I know they're kind of overused lately... but your colors should be, like, yellow and gray.
You know, I've always been against destination weddings, but it's nice to finally see Denver.
The Guy who Lived In-Between the Hatfields and the McCoys.
And I'm not going to ask who killed my daughter.
All I can see are the spider veins of alcoholics wearing shorts.
We just got to accept the fact that, well, we're... we're kind of cowards.
I'm afraid of small dogs, girls with pigtails, flying monkeys...
Yes, and fear is a logical response to actual danger.
That's very cute, Stewie, but if I let you dress up like Héctor Elizondo, I have to let everyone.
I heard what happened to you at The Drunken Clam.
I was in the military for 30 years back when that meant something.
I bought one of those crippled-guy robot suits from Avatar, so now I can be on top.
I heard about what happened at the Clam, and I'm not interested in having sex with a quarter of a man.
Everybody heard about what happened over at the Clam and how those guys made you their bitch.
Which means there's gonna be some big changes around here.
You know how we promised never to lie to each other?
Long enough to know you have herpes and do weird stuff with your teddy bear.
Yeah, well, I just wanted to let you know you're not alone.
Not only that, but I also got it from Brian.
Yup, he knew he had herpes and he didn't say anything.
I just want to thank you for helping me reach a state of cocaine-fueled
Can I put this fire extinguisher someplace interesting and take your picture?
Um, uh, Meg, can you, um... can you please pass the milk?
Please tell me this isn't still about how you punked out in front of those guys at the Clam.
Peter, I want you to march down to the Clam right now and get your booth back.
If they see me crying, they'll have to give us our booth back.
No! I'm saying you got to go down there and take it back.
I am going to the Clam and I'm getting my booth back.
I think we're all suffering from what happened down at the Clam.
Yeah, I had to start taking pills so I'd stop thinking about it.
We need to march back down to the Clam and take back what's ours.
He's right. We need to sit up to those guys.
You want to get yourselves killed, that's your business, but I'm not going.
Do you mind if I stand next to you while we eat standing?
Hey, let's go grab some good beer even though we brought the bad beer.
And these two barbecue scumbags formed a lifelong friendship until their deaths at the ripe old age of 52 in separate ATV accidents.
You know, I'm so glad you finally agreed to go out with me, Jenna.
Yes, thank you, we'll take the table in the corner, next to the herpes dog.
Wow, you must be such a good person to knowingly go out with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.
If you bastards want our booth, you got to go through us to get it.
If we don't stand up for ourselves now, we'll regret it for the rest of our lives.
And this might be the stupidest thing I've ever done, but...
And I even have this special little case for it.
All right, guys, I know this looks desperate, but I've got this can of spinach.
You know, I almost said no chairs at the beginning.
Why don't you just admit you're beat and get out of here?
Hell, I witnessed every significant historical event in my lifetime right here!
I was in this booth when President Obama was elected.
So, if you want this booth, you're gonna have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.
If I could touch my own head, I'd salute you.
I can't believe I have to root for Afghanistan now.
I want to drive your Prius to the end of the block all by myself.
That's, uh... that's way past the end of the block.
I want to go on a date with Neve Campbell so I can give her a nice ladle of Stew.
I guess... I guess I was just too embarrassed to admit I had herpes.
It was a rotten thing to do, and I promise I will never lie to you again.
So, I'm gonna have herpes for the rest of my life, huh?
Yeah, but most of the time, it won't even be an issue.
It only really flares up during periods of great stress.
Dial Cross Species is specially formulated for both humans and dogs.
Now, you'll be watching Stewie, and I don't want you just to prop him up next to the TV all day.
It'll do you good to spend some time with your son.
Ah, nothing like a day at the park, surrounded by overcompensating divorced dads.
Oh, my God, it's only been five minutes, and I'm already bored out of my mind.
Aah! Well, I guess I see those guys all the time.
A clown?! Eh, well, I guess what's the big deal, huh? It's just one.
Oh, I was quite sure it was just one from the size of the car!
Peter, they threw what I thought was a bucket of water on me, but it turns out, it was just a bunch of confetti!
Okay, okay. It's okay as long as I can still see him.
That was a wink, but you don't know it 'cause it's just a eye.
The doctor says it's as if our breasts have been X-rayed five hours a day, every day, for the last three years!
First, every woman I've ever known, and now you guys.
H-Hey, it's hard to hear you over the sound of joyful children in the park.
I want to tell him Mommy's on her way home.
She wants to talk to Stewie. What do I do?!
Here, give me the phone. I do a great Stewie.
Hey, what happened to my new friend, that kid who sort of looks like me from behind?
I'll never get to grow old and become an across-the-country grandparent.
Yes! He's right there trying to say hi to you.
I got to get you back to the park and find...
My name is Peter, and I work at the brewer...
I'm gonna go give my baby a kiss good night.
Uh, Lois, I had an affair, and I think we should talk about it!
Peter, jamming yourself into a grapefruit is not an affair.
I left my husband in charge, which was obviously a terrible mistake.
Now, what do you say we all sit down and watch this Weird Al Yankovic documentary?
How the hell can you possibly mistake another baby for Stewie?!
I already got a Facebook friend request from the dad.
Peter, I have put up with your nonsense for 20 years, but today you crossed a line.
Hey, I think there was a mix-up at the park.
We now return to The Karate Kid, with realistic human feelings.
I hate to sound like every woman ever, but I'm depressed.
So, I don't tell her all the bad things about herself.
Like how the mole on her back is changing shape and size really quickly.
At least you're not two foreign guys talking too loud in the next booth.
We've got to make like '70s rock man Garrett and leave.
Looks like you and me will have to make hands on each other tonight.
Peter, maybe you need to broaden your horizons, you know?
It's time to travel, to learn, to experience new things.
I've been letting opportunities pass me by ever since I was a kid.
Hey, kid, get in my van, and I'll give you some candy.
Hey, kid, get in my van, and I'll give you some candy.
Stella, I need you to go to Chicago on Thursday.
Why does every fight have to go to the death?
Angela, if you got business traveling that needs to be done, I'm your guy.
Griffin, I'm not gonna look over there until you first assure me you've got pants on.
It's not a rule unless there's a sign on the wall.
So you'd be willing to take that trip to Chicago for the company?
Honey? My inside left boob stomach did that thing again.
Um, I don't know about any of that, but I think I should eat something.
But that-that other stuff, they all sound like the kind of things I could do to expand my horizons.
I haven't felt this sense of limitless adventure since I went cave jumping.
Man, I'm, like, the fifth most attractive woman in Chicago.
You have your choice of narrators: our senior curator or Chicago's own Dennis Farina.
Just so you know, I'll be eating through most of this.
Now, he was a midge, but he painted like a normal.
Now, here is a naked chick made completely out of marble.
I got to wonder-- I'm sure you do, too-- how this thing didn't crack when they were carving out her downstairs business.
Wow, who knew you could learn so much at a museum?
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer for every business trip, and see all the great stuff that's out there.
We now return to Janeane Garofalo and Mark Ruffalo in Garofaruffalo.
That's right, Lois; I live the life of the mind now.
My brain is awash with theorems and profundity and abstractions that I can pontificate upon at length.
This is our new bookshelf, and I think you'll find it has more channels than any TV we've ever owned.
Then I shall read to you from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
Perhaps you'd like to hear about Jane Eyre, who felt quite the new girl at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.
You know, these are some of my favorite books and authors.
Peter, I can't get over the way you've transformed yourself.
Well, Lois, some of it came from books, some came from museums, and, honestly, a lot of it just came from travel.
And how will you be paying for your rental, sir?
I will pay you with stories of my abusive father set to dissonant flute.
A child should sleep on his bed, not under it.
You know, an ancient tongue can be as titillating as a young one.
Peter, what gives? Ever since you had all those business trips, you've been acting weird.
Pity a man in familiar places who yet feels like a stranger.
You... you're the dick who wrote that in the bathroom!
Now I know why Oscar Wilde turned to alcoholism and bone inhalation.
He was feared by everyone up and down Prabhatam Drive.
All right, if this is to be a smart family, we will have to learn not to giggle at smart things that sound dirty but are not.
I always thought spotted dick had something to do with Morgan Freeman.
Aah! We're in a real jar of jam this time, Wizard Robot.
I have put too much suds in this machine for washing clothes.
And tonight is the night I meet with other members of my form twelve learning mates to celebrate the exactly two groupings of ten years ago.
Let us leave the room where no comedic situation will soon take place.
Oh, as long as you're here, can you run some vocabulary with me?
I need to know how to use these words in sentences by the time Peter gets home.
Oh, that should be easy. Just give me the word, and I'll put it in a sentence for you. Anodyne.
I can't take this anymore, Brian, and the kids can't either.
Wait, I thought this was what you always wanted-- for Peter not to be an idiot.
Oh, at least that Peter was fun and didn't make me feel so stupid.
If you look out the window, you'll see the Rocky Mountains!
If visiting San Francisco and New York made Peter smart, maybe if we send him to the dumbest city in the whole country, it'll bring back the old Peter.
Heads up, guys. I farted on the doorstep, but it's hot on my trail.
Tonight, the conclusion of our three-part report on bestiality at the aquarium.
A local boy dies after playing video games for 51 hours straight.
Yeah, I've flown back-to-back Australia trips that were longer than that.
Bonnie won't look for it, and I can't find it.
I used to pull all-nighters when I worked for that lesbian carpet-cleaning company.
When you're done with that, can you help me plug the hole in this dike?
I baked a fresh batch of cookies for your slumber party.
No... no, I... I faked my death to get the IRS off my back.
Does that mean I have to give back the insurance money?
Oh, you guys are more meaner than The Jerky Boys.
Yeah, whatever, Quagmire. I got to go to the bathroom.
Damn it, Joe. What are you staring at? Pull him off me.
I will go to the FBI. I will go to the police.
I need to know if I can delete your iCarlys from the DVR.
There's no way to prove which one of you fell asleep first.
There's a naked lady squatting over a cake in your kitchen.
And it looks like I went text message or voice mail.
And there's a little bit of blood in my ear.
You can tell by the laminated high school football schedule on the wall.
I'm gonna go see which lobster I think deserves to die.
I thought you gave a great book report at school today.
Well, all I know is you looked cute while you gave it.
Sure, I do. We're in the same gossip group in the cafeteria at lunch.
Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a little
Cheep, cheep, cheep, talk a lot, pick a little more.
Come on, Pam, we got to go before they see the tip.
I would've left more, but he messed up our order.
So, there's a penguin on the front and it says, I hear you're 40.
And then happy birthday is all blurry, because whoever opens the card is 40 and you want to give them the impression that their eyes are starting to go.
You know, Chris, Usher categorizes his girls into two groups: bitches he's with and bitches he's gonna get with.
So is this one you got or one you gon' get?
Chris, can I speak to you for a moment privately?
I-I figured the day you came home with a girl, we'd have to back her through the garage.
Okay, all right. Now, do you prefer Fatty or Miss Boom-Bi-Latty?
Now, let's go see your mom's done listing all the black people she's ever seen on television.
Flip Wilson, John Amos, Diahann Carroll, that monster that plays tennis.
Don't, uh... don't look at my kids when they're off doing their private lives.
Look, I think if you got to know us better, you wouldn't have any problem with your daughter dating one of us.
Look, why don't you and Pam come over tomorrow night, a-and you'll see that white people are even better than black people.
But I want you to know I'm very skeptical about this whole thing.
It's about time people of color broke bread at this table.
Who are you, St. Francis of Assisi all of a sudden?
Jerome, you have done a wonderful job raising Pam to be a lovely young woman.
Sounds like you're saying a single black man can't raise a child on his own.
You know, before I speak, I like to ask myself, Would Dr. King approve of what I'm about to say?
Dad, I think Mrs. Griffin was just giving you a compliment.
Yeah, I was just trying to say we all appreciate having you in our home.
Peter, you only got two of those three things right.
You're being all nice just so your son can get into my daughter's pants.
White guys don't want a relationship with black women-- they just want a notch on their belt.
This is the moment in the meal when I stand up!
Her womb was like one of those places where they reconstruct crashed airplanes.
Look, Jerome, I-I know you think we're all terrible, but white people have done a lot of good things for the world.
Even though they dress and try to talk like you
A virtual world of porn so you can spill your seed
You know what? That song only made me hate white people even more.
Straight up. You ain't swervin' with him, you ain't gonna shump-a-jump, you're not hollerin' at him, you ain't his shorty or his boo.
Oh, my God, Lois, I think he just summoned Candyman.
I'm sorry, Chris. Jerome just doesn't think his daughter should date a white guy.
Black racism is the biggest problem facing this country today.
You know, I should go over there and fight for Pam.
She left me a note saying she ran off with Chris.
Look, let me help you! I'm great at finding stuff.
I was able to please her in other ways, though.
Okay, but all I know about sex is from Internet porn, so I'm very excited to try buffering.
Then I'll leave you alone to get undressed and under the covers, and I'll be right back.
Oh, God. Are we at that part of the relationship?
Pam, this may come as a surprise to you, but I am not an experienced lover.
So, all those other black drivers that you're nodding at, do you know them?
If you're asking if I'd rather be at the zoo, then yes.
Maybe you step out of the car and we see if you've been drinking.
I'm too fat to be in the car by myself.
The police pull me over for made-up violations all the time.
You don't know what it's like to be treated like a criminal.
I own a business, I pay my taxes, and yet I got to deal with this crap every time I step outside my house.
Makes me so damn angry, I don't know what to do with myself.
Whenever I get angry, I go do some Footloose dancing.
I don't mind having you in my bar, man, but it's different when it's your baby girl.
Forgive me for being a protective father, but white people have exploited and mistreated blacks for centuries, and I'm not gonna let that happen to Pam.
Wow, we've driven 55 miles with the gas light on.
I tucked it between my legs as a joke and then it got stuck.
Look, I'm sorry, Chris, but we got to respect Jerome's wishes.
I realize he's a good man who has reason to be a little suspicious of Whitey.
Jerome is right. White is white, black is black-- got to keep the races completely separate.
Chris, from now on, I don't want you talking to any black people.
How the hell am I supposed to get through airport security?
Is that the lesson you want me to learn, Dad?
Just 'cause I've experienced some hard times doesn't mean this generation can't teach us a thing or two.
All right, if these kids want to date, then I guess that's okay with me.
It takes a man with a crazy big hog to admit when he's wrong.
Welcome, all, to James Woods High's annual college fair, where each year, our seniors gather to decide where they will go in the fall to get HPV.
Yeah. There's a state college with an incredibly offensive Native American mascot.
Oh, boy, that is a tough, tough place to get into, Lois.
That is tough, but once you're in there, you'd be surprised how much you like it.
I always thought she was gonna be one of those ladies who wears a jean jacket and hangs out at the bar in a chain restaurant.
Hey. You know you can get a slice of pineapple on your burger here.
Yeah, she's a solid B student and that's quite an accomplishment, considering none of her teachers are willing to sleep with her.
Anyway, I was able to get Meg an interview this weekend at Green Mountain College in Vermont.
Meg, please excuse your mother and I for a moment.
Yes, you do. You have that wicker basket in the laundry room with the frayed bath mat in it.
God, I can't get any peace and quiet in this house.
Well, now you know how I felt at Mardi Gras.
Well, you in the wrong place if you ain't looking for trouble, boy.
Big ol' hoot-owl come down, scoop you up, take your eye out.
All right. Well, can you at least clean this stuff up when you're done?
Yeah! You got that stink all up on you, now!
It's like a burning tire dump right in my nose!
Peter, please tell me this is covered by our insurance.
Hey, guys, I-I think the tomato juice is really working. Don't you?
I'm an inside dog! I'm sorry, Brian, but you stink.
Damn it, I just gave away my hiding place for meatball subs!
I-I'll tell you where there definitely aren't any meatball subs-- the side pocket of my golf bag.
No! I was so cold. And you have no idea how many terrifying things there are out here in the dark.
My nephew, Scrappy Brian, didn't even make it through the night.
Damn it! I told my sister this wasn't a good weekend.
They got the heat cranked up so high in here,
Well, at least throw me down some food or something.
All I have is a steak, but that belongs to Rupert.
It's not his fault. He was a great gumball machine-- they just shouldn't have promoted him.
The wind wants my hand to go back, but I'm not letting it.
Now, go on, get out of here, you little bastard.
I feel like a dude who just touched his first vagina.
Well, I called and confirmed my interview for tomorrow morning.
From you. Dad, I've been hearing that song in the backseat of your car since I was a little kid.
Wait, were you that little fat boy with the glasses?
Time to put the might-mouse in the White House, Meg.
And you hate Mike Teavee. Oh, don't even say his name.
Dad, sometimes I wonder why you even had a family.
I don't know, it's just, I was dating your mother,
I don't like the way condoms feel, next thing you know,
I got a mortgage, a kid, and a crappy job at a toy factory.
Thanks to you, Dr. Griffin, my bunion is healed and I can walk without pain.
Boy, after all this food, we're gonna have a couple of night moves back at the motel later, huh, Dad?
Oh, absolutely. You know, that's what this song's about, Meg.
All of Bob Seger's songs are about taking dumps at night.
Uh, Night Moves, Like a Rock, Shakedown, The Fire Down Below. Against the Wind was him poopin' out of a car.
Let's go. If we meet any chicks, you're my daughter.
You got a funny little wiener, but you're a nice guy, Meg.
Yeah, these might be throwin'-at-buses apples, not eatin' apples. See, Meg?
You can be in the flashback 'cause we're friends now.
This is where I belong, out here in the wild.
Um, I think we all know the answer to this, but should I get tested?
By the way, if a girl named Rachel calls, it's a wrong number, but do tell me that she called.
Yeah, so we missed the interview, so that's a shame.
Meg, how could you blow your chance to go to your first-choice college?
Hey, Meg, you want to huck some water balloons at nerds?
God, look at Lois picking food from her teeth with her nail.
Meg, I'm glad you're having a good time with your father, but don't let him distract you from your priorities.
Remember, you still have a chance to get into college.
I'm just saying, it's not easy dealing with your father's craziness.
Believe me, this is no job for the family's designated schmendrick.
That's what your father said before he took that walking tour of Providence.
This is where a homeless man ate the finger of another homeless man.
This is where some teenagers beat a gay guy to death.
And this is where fake tour guides throw rocks and steal tourists' wallets.
All right, Meg, you and me are gonna get something pierced together.
Awesome. Come on, let's go next door and get your mom a funny refrigerator magnet.
Meg, you've probably wondered from time to time how on earth I pay for all my shenanigans.
We got 150 seconds before the police respond to the silent alarm!
He's the only one with the combination to the safe!
But a part of growing up is learning how to handle a tough situation on your own, like getting into college or breaking up with your father.
Scoutmaster Davenport, you want to share a tent with me tonight?
I've been taking a break from Lois's breast milk, and her boobs are enormous.
You should come check 'em out before they get infected.
Yeah, nice try, Stewie, but I'm still not coming inside.
You see, living in the wild, I-I've realized that all the pain I've ever had in my life has-has come from me always trying to be something I'm not.
I mean, I'm not a writer, I'm not an artist,
I'm sorry, Stewie, but nothing will ever make me come back inside.
Hey, let's put on fake eyelashes and flirt with people on the bus.
They let me reschedule my interview, so I'm gonna drive back up there.
It's time for me to get serious about my life and take some responsibility.
This is why that woman in Texas drowned all her kids.
Well, you know how I don't ever brag about my sexual exploits.
Wha... I-I don't... you-you were crippled when you were an adult.
A few months back, I got really drunk and was playing around with an elastic band.
I wrapped it around my thigh and forgot about it for a week or two and uh, yeah, so, that's my left foot now.
You know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show.
It looked like a big, purple penis and your ratings blew.
Like, some black guy who's never met another black guy?
Here's four seasons worth of DVDs of what we've been up to.
And I'll warn you ahead of time: these have jokes in them.
I think a lot of times you only say things because they make you sound good.
You know, Cleveland, it must be weird for you guys to move and not 'cause of a hurricane.
Now Peter will have something to do besides flushing the toilet to Foghat's Slow Ride.
For a while, it was an orphanage where the children sang desolate songs.
I really appreciate y'all helpin' me fix up my house.
Hey, where do you want me to put all these giraffe figurines?
Yeah, or like a bug walkin' through Stevie Wonder's hair.
Turns out this old house is lacking in storage space, so I gotta make some tough decisions.
They're just to keep my trunk closed what if I'm ever haulin' garbage.
I'm gonna go ahead and ditch these promotional McDonald's cups from the 80's.
How do you live in a house with all this junk?
Uh, please take the potty seat off the toilet, don't try to pee through it.
There's juice boxes in the fridge and if you get hungry, there's plenty of Goldfish in the couch.
Um, feel free to watch TV with the sound off.
And the kids will be down here first thing in the morning to antagonize the dogs.
Oh, and everyone here has pinkeye. ...And that was the moment I stopped being Dwayne Johnson and started being The Rock.
On the drive up from Virginia, she kept that vase 'tween her legs.
I can't believe Japanese men pay good money for this.
I was playing with Rallo and I broke a vase and then she gave me a spanking!
Whoa, can I get some white bread on that judgmental sandwich?
Lois, I've spent my life trying to keep race out of things.
That's why whenever I walk into Lids, every guy fist-bumps me.
I'm just saying, Lois, some of us go through life without seeing color.
Hey, remember when you swallowed that rib-eye bone and you couldn't poop it out?
And then you pushed real hard and the poo came through the rib eye hole?
Peter, we gotta go over there and talk to Donna.
All right, but you need to cool down first, Lois.
What I do is throw a shot put into a crowd and make it look like an accident.
That woman is gonna be sorry she laid her hands on our son.
Hi, j-just so you know, this is sort of Lois's thing.
Donna, what gives you the right to spank my child?
And maybe I wouldn't have to discipline your child if you did it yourself!
The only thing kids learn from spanking is adults don't have the patience to teach them.
How many gray pubes you pluck today, you old bag?
From now on, I don't want our families having anything to do with each other!
Well, Cleveland, looks like these two little alley cats have scrapped it out. I'll see you tomorrow.
And Cleveland, I forbid you from ever talking to Peter again!
No, our wives got in a big fight and banned us from seeing each other.
But, Cleveland, you and I are pals, and I just got you back.
We just got to hang out where there's no chance we'll be seen.
I'm closer to you than I am to my own right hand.
Why you thought it was appropriate to show up here, Cheryl, I have no idea.
I just figured a plane is a safe place where you and I can hang out and not be seen by our wives.
Oh, that makes sense. So, what have you been up to?
Yup, sorry, Cleveland, I'm gonna have to cut you off there.
I don't care about the alignment of the dark forces!
Do you have any idea how fast you were going, sir?
Hey, Cleveland, this is just so we can talk without getting spotted by Lois and Donna.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
We now return to Slightly Too Early Comedy Club Audience Member.
Not like when Clinton was in the White House, huh?
When Clinton was in the White House, all you needed to vote was a piece of duct tape and a...
I mean, the President of the United States might as well be...
The other day, my wife asked me if her ass looked fat in her jeans.
Sleeping lower in the house is a big punishment for her.
I can't keep sneaking around trying to hang out with Cleveland.
I mean, I'm the guy who figured out how much eye contact a band should make during a guitar solo.
Yeah, we're in sync, and showing others how much we love the song.
All right, Cleveland, nothing bonds women together like having to take care of invalid husbands in the hospital.
Well, women will always band together to stop an offensive art exhibit from coming to town.
So I've arranged for all my photos of baby wieners to be put on display.
Oh, Peter, I'm gonna have to call the police on this.
Peter, these are hundreds of naked babies in suggestive situations!
And they're time-stamped as far back as 1998, which is way before we had this idea!
All right, Cleveland, one thing that always bonds women is healing an abused animal.
And you need to release that eagle out into the...
Peter, let's just give Susie her gift, eat our cake and leave.
I don't want to be here with that Brown family.
And for my next trick, I'm gonna split my beautiful assistant in half.
And I'm telling you, Cleveland and I have won every three-legged race in Quahog except that time those two one-legged guys formed the perfect running person.
We started this race together, we're gonna finish it together.
You know, Donna, they've known each other a lot longer than we have.
And if we're gonna be neighbors, we're gonna have to learn to set aside our differences.
You know, Cleveland, I got to say, it's great having the old gang back together again.
We now return to Jeremy Piven as The Incredible Hulk.
Because, Brian, tonight we sup on the finest feast of the television season.
It is the season finale of The Cadwalliders of Essex.
It's a British show about a wealthy family dealing with slight change.
Is that the one where even the children have muttonchops?
She got plowed on a pile of hay in Game of Thrones.
Like a guy who cheats on his right hand with his left hand.
I want to stay, but I just got called back into the office.
I'm gonna live-tweet the show and ruin it for everyone in other time zones.
Wouldn't it be marvelous to be a part of a family like that?
Two guys run at each other with mattresses, and, um... th-that's kind of it.
I don't want to watch it upstairs on the small TV!
I want to watch it downstairs on the big TV!
Aw, do you want a hug from your big sister?
Hey, I just wanted to check on how you're doing, buddy.
Oh, you dick, you just came in to charge your phone.
Whatever. I'm gonna be out of this place soon anyway.
Look, Brian, I need this machine to alter the past for the better.
Being born into it was clearly some sort of cosmic mistake, so I'm going back in time to prevent that mistake.
I'm going to break up Lois and the fat man before they can conceive me.
Remember when I tried to open that lemonade stand with Chris?
And the fat man won't even let me celebrate a proper birthday.
Look, Stewie, I know you're angry about last night, but you're talking about erasing your existence.
Look, I-I got to get this call, but don't do anything stupid.
Oh, and by the way, thanks for asking me if I wanted something from Subway, too.
Live from the shores of Rhode Island, it's the fatty who drives you batty!
Karen Washington from the Rhode Island Zoo and some rejected toys you're not gonna believe.
She is camel toe-ing the hell out of that leotard.
All right, Rupert, time to break up Lois and the fat man before they can conceive me by pressing butts together.
Wow, Peter and Lois were really in love before I was born.
Breaking them up may prove to be more difficult than I thought.
Like when I had to ride that bike in The Muppet Movie.
So I've maxed out Lois's credit card on vibrating marital aids.
Peter, there's an open box in the kitchen addressed to me with nothing inside.
Uh, yeah, when I opened it up, it was empty.
Well, that's very strange, because it looked large enough to hold many items.
Huh. Maybe I had more in common with this family than I thought.
I didn't do it, but... but you look really cool.
None of my attempts to break them up has worked thus far, so I had to up our game.
I just got a note from Goodwill thanking me for donating all my porn.
I'm sick and tired of you blaming me for things I didn't do!
I don't appreciate how you spray-painted vile woman on the bedroom wall.
Well, you know something, I'm starting to think whoever wrote that is right!
Well, maybe I don't want to live with someone who doesn't respect me!
Well, Rupert, this means you and I will never have met.
So I've got to tell you one thing: you know that song I wrote you for Valentine's Day?
Ooh, I wonder if I'll have one of those pug-nosed British dogs that licks its own snot all day.
I'm not gonna be the dog to some poof baby.
This is your valet, your gardener, your cook, your gamekeeper, your butler, your housekeeper, your parlor maid, your housemaid, your scullery maid, your shoe de-graveler and one superfluous employee who I am not in a gay relationship with.
This will be our last physical contact until I give you a firm handshake on your 18th birthday.
And let's be honest, if I had stayed with the Griffins,
Sir, it's 6:00 p.m. and you're still in your 5:45 tuxedo.
Is that something I need to bring up with my father?
My heavens, my father is the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire,
Dean of Physics at Oxford, and he was pre-approved for a Capital One No-Hassle Card.
Jaden was first form in his sixth levels and he's chief scrum-flanker on his varsity boogling team, which, as far as we know, makes us terribly proud.
You're only here because Father is a heavy sleeper with a frequent morning stem.
Father, is it going to live here for a while?
I'm not afraid to take a little walk on the Oscar Wilde side.
Stewart, I think your mouth is better at taking things in than spewing them out.
Wow, these guys are a little sharper than my old family.
Sorry I couldn't squeeze no more juice outta me nippers.
I can't be mad at someone who lost seven sons in the war.
The only thing in this crib is a 19th-century dueling pistol.
Who dares to shoot the bow tie off my cat?
I wanted to be free of the family of morons
And I don't want a cold mother or an Oxford physics professor father.
The Oxford physics lab will have everything I need to build a time machine.
I can just walk past them holding a cup of tea.
Well, I did at first, but then he's got the tea vouching for him, doesn't he?
All right, Rupert, I left the fat man's entire porn collection on the curb for Goodwill to pick up.
I sound the same, but I spell some words very differently.
Let me write the word color on a piece of paper for you.
You successfully prevented your own birth, and instead you were born into an alternate family.
But you must believe me, the Griffins are your true destiny.
He loves The Dead and he's, uh... he's not doing so well.
Peter, I had nothing to do with donating your stupid porn!
If what you're telling me is true, we can't let them separate.
You're right! And if I know her, she'll be heading to the fridge for her angry afternoon Chardonnay.
Why should I stay if you don't even trust me?
Honestly, I-I don't know what I would do on my own.
Like, I literally have no idea where food comes from.
You know, you'll be fading away any moment, you know?
With smooth lips, I will finally be able to be a mayor who kisses babies with confidence!
Well, you're certainly in a better mood since last night's tantrum.
You know, Brian, I've realized this is where I belong.
We now return to the All in the Family and Modern Family crossover episode.
Oh, yeah, I knew them two was hummus the minute they walked in the door.
Yay! A crossover always brings out the best in each show!
The priorities are always creative, and not driven by marketing or...
Look at this. Dennis the Menace is just shoveling snow.
You know something? I could do better than these idiots.
I should just go down to the paper and sell 'em my own.
Well, Peter, you might be underestimating the difficulty of writing a comic strip.
I can vouch for the unforgiving face of a blank sheet of paper.
In fact, I think it was William Faulkner who said...
I call my comic For Pete's Sake, because it points out things that make you shake your head and say, For Pete's sake.
I like how you retell tired old gags with a detached, ironic approach.
Yeah, plus, it's all brand-new jokes that I'm really, really serious about.
Well, good for you, Peter, but how did you get published so quickly?
Ah, the editor of the paper owed me a favor.
Why can't anyone get me a picture of the Spider-Man?!
Yeah, I got a whole subreddit of superhero thong shots.
Peter, you should do one where a baseball player can't steal second,
Yeah, you put an island in there, you're in business.
Hey, how about one where you draw a sock, and it says Sock it to me, or-or maybe draw Lois taking a hot-tub dump, and she just says whatever?
Peter, your comic in this morning's paper is really offensive.
Gosh, it's not like the Internet to go crazy about something small and stupid.
I got in trouble for something I said about a woman.
We're talking to Peter Griffin, the artist behind For Pete's Sake, which has caused outrage with a misogynistic comic.
'cause you spent two minutes of the last segment applauding a red velvet cake.
And if that's not bad enough, this morning's cartoon is even worse.
Mr. Griffin, do you really think this is an appropriate cartoon to run on Gloria Steinem's half-birthday?
You have no idea how offensive you are to women, do you?
I bet I can name more porn stars than you.
But-but don't tell my wife how many porn stars I know.
There are people who just started an hour ago, and I know 'em.
It wasn't even funny, and I have a great sense of humor.
No, no, they're angry, Chris, but they ain't gonna get violent.
Maybe we should get out of Quahog for a while.
We should get out of town till this all blows over.
I just want to turn in my last For Pete's Sake. going out on top amid a flurry of gambling rumors.
I figure we've been on the road about 20% of the time.
For this leg of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash.
Although, I got to say, you never get to see somebody else driving your car.
I don't know, Lois. This seems like a one-shot deal.
We're here to find the police, report our stolen car.
Lois, whip out your boob, give the boy his lunch.
And then, several days later, we receive them and make them available for purchase.
'Cause I forgot to mention, all our money is in our stolen car.
Sir, we can pay you back for the donuts when we find our car.
Do you think that I am moved by your sob story?
I come from a country where the words for sewage and beverage are the same.
How come this convenience store has so many shadowy parts?
No man should be so poor he cannot pay for a donut.
Tell them what I did, Apu. He stole the donuts.
Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then, uh, you know, the others.
I think you and I are gonna get along just okay.
But if you want to save us a little time, you can start tracing his body with chalk.
Be careful. I think some of them might be cops.
Well, we got a procedure for handling alleged crimes around here.
Let's see. Uh, did you contribute to the policeman's ball?
Yeah, all right, well, with no contribution, your report goes right into the circular file.
I don't usually check this file, so it might be a while until we find that car of yours.
Uh, Chief, that excuse to leave you asked for is here.
Oh, thank you so much for putting us up until we find our car.
And thank you for not being a band of hippie murderers.
You bring home two bands of hippie murderers, and suddenly, that's all you're about.
But how did you even get access to his butt cheeks?
I'm not the only one who got kicked out of camp.
I love that! Is that a popular expression, like what the deuce? Probably more popular.
He doesn't need lasers or time machines, just gum balls and marbles and balls of string.
Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a friend, last name Keebum, first name Lee.
Come on, look at the stools-- is there a Lee Keebum?
Somebody check the rear-- I know I got a Lee Keebum.
There must be, like, 20 of them! a lot of trophies of your own.
After all, Nelson Mandela said it's our obligation to shine.
But I mean the light within you that makes you an individual.
Hey, couldn't help but notice there's no seat for me.
Oh. I was under the impression that you were a dog.
Why, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that...
I-I don't see what that has to do with the discussion.
Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right? You cool with that?
Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?
Hey, you know-- aw, damn it, I don't have a comic strip anymore.
So, still no word from the police on your stolen car?
I bet you and me can find your car on our own.
'Cause Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are a great team!
Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are an even greater team than the Air Force!
We got to carry him, 'cause he can't fly on his own.
We let that other guy try, and look what happened.
God, I can't believe I got stuck taking their stupid dog for a walk.
Stupid? Well, I don't know, I think he's kind of fun.
I was starting to think you wouldn't show, Dr. Dog.
I don't know. You're the one who sniffed his butt.
I mean, unless you think it sucked, in which case it sucked.
So, you know, um, I'm only wearing this diaper as a dare, you know-- it's not, like, an everyday thing.
Hey, loser, I copied off your spelling test and got a D!
I say, how long has that boy been treating you like that?
All right, Peter, if we're gonna find your car, we got to think like a car.
Okay, I got a great idea how we're gonna find my stolen car.
And then when we find it, we'll actually charge the guy!
Well, none of these is my car, but we promised these scumbags a show.
Love is like a bomb, baby, come on, get it on
Hey, Chief, we could arrest every single car thief in Springfield.
I don't know! I feel like I'm good at nothing!
Those are the days I'm glad I have my saxophone.
It was okay, but it would be a shame to waste such great butcher's arms on a musical instrument.
You and I have quite a day ahead of us.
Oh, that's a clown I painted, so you know I'm truly insane.
Aw, you like that behind the ear, don't you, boy?
How does that help us? We're creating a broad story.
Also, Matthew McConaughey is in here, too! All right, all right, all right.
We-we thought it was him, but it was just the oven!
Okay, Santa's Little Helper got all tuckered out from his playdate, so he went out back to take a nap under that tree where nobody knows quite where it is.
Hey, what happened to Jack Nicholson and that other dog? Yep.
Wait, aren't you supposed to be looking for our car?
Didn't find the car, Lois, but I found a good time with a good pal.
That's an actual question. I don't know who Quagmire is.
Peter, I'm glad you made a friend, but what about our car?
What's the one surefire way to find a lost car?
Oh, things never work the way they do on the box.
That confused old guy must have been driving it by mistake.
How many confused old guys you got in this town?
Well, Homer, thanks for helping me get my car back.
And to show my appreciation, I got a little something for you.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's not a rip-off of Duff.
It may have been inspired by Duff, but I-I like to think it goes in a different direction.
No, this is just the same as Duff, but, like, worse.
Hey, come on, now, this is my favorite beer you're talking about.
You can't just slap a new label on something and call it your own!
Well, maybe Duff should be in trouble for, you know, not being that great.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I-I used to love Duff when I was younger, but I-I haven't even had it in, like, 13 years.
I represent the Duff Brewery, and you, sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement.
Yeah, I got a job for you riding on something.
'cause we usually only do these things for half an hour.
A nice day for stabbing a friend in the back.
Yeah, and a nice day for bringing thieves to justice.
Your Honor, citizens of Springfield and visitors from Quahog, my client, the Duff Brewery, is the victim of flagrant intellectual theft.
But it's not just the main Duff recipe that's been plagiarized.
Several other Duff variations, packages and design elements have been similarly infringed, resulting again and again in pale imitations, chp coes, clumsy counterfeits and weak substitutions.
You know why they got us sitting next to each other.
Uh, 'cause we're the two funniest guys in our towns?
I've heard all I need to hear to make a decision.
If you ask me, neither of these beers is wholly original.
They're both pale imitations of my favorite beer, Bud Rock.
Well, the Pawtucket Brewery will be shut down, so I guess we got to go back to Quahog and find Peter a new job.
Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice to meet you and your family, even though you kind of screwed us over.
And, hey, next time you stay with a family, maybe you can wear a bra some of the time.
Hey, uh, Marge, uh, listen, there's something difficult that I've been trying to figure out how to tell you, and, um... it's about, uh, Santa's Little Helper.
You were trying to figure out a way to tell me that?
I cut your name in my arm so I'll always remember you.
Lisa, no one has ever done anything this nice for me.
My prom date was a scarecrow I stole, and he left with someone else.
The inside of my hat smells so bad I'm not allowed in most restaurants... Hey, hey!
I was starting to worry this was a one-way thing.
I know Apu's not your enemy, but I just wanted to say, I took Apu.
So, how do you want to keep in touch? Facebook? Twitter?
Late-night phone calls lying on our tummies with our feet up in the air?
Bart, if we don't keep in touch, I'll kill myself.
Duff is more experimental than any partner I've ever had.
You know, when I first met you, I thought, hey, I love this guy!
But now, I think I speak for all of us when I say, I am over the Simpsons!
No, it doesn't! I do it to my son all the time.
No wonder he's fat and stupid and masturbates all the time.
Hey, that's no fair. I don't got none of them.
And remember, kids, TV violence is fine as long as you don't show a nipple.
It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury...
I think you're gonna get a kick out of this.
Let's just agree to stay a half hour away from each other.
Oh, and thank God all the commotion about Dad's comic blew over.
Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore, but you are a local hero for defending our beer, and apparently, that's more important than hating women.
What? I don't understand. Ain't the brewery out of business?
We lost a court case. Yes, we lost, but how are they gonna enforce it?
Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bart didn't want to be your friend.
He was lame. If you ask me, he kind of sounded like a girl. Really?
And I can understand losing a friend and feeling rejected.
Speaking of which, I'm gonna go howl at the moon.
Hey, guys. You look like you're getting a little red.
These got a little mixed up. Hey, glad you guys could make it!
He's obviously cleaning his feet in the pool without making it look like he's cleaning his feet in the pool.
I wonder if this temp is the same on my other foot.
Honey, it doesn't seem like the Griffins are leaving anytime too soon!
They're just some stupid scribbles I've been working on for a children's book.
I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great!
Wow. Well, that really means a lot to me, Peter.
I've been working on this book for nine years, but I've been too afraid to show it to anybody.
It's about a handicapped squirrel who has to learn to overcome his disabilities so he can survive in the wild.
Well, you know, you ought to do something with this.
Hey, uh, you wouldn't maybe want to grab a bite to eat sometime, would you?
I tried the online dating thing, but there's just too much competition out there.
Due to a gut-busting divorce, limited people skills, and significant prodding from my therapist,
I am currently seeking online companionship as a short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman.
And I would love to attempt to convert my heavily embellished Internet profile and carefully airbrushed, out-of-date photo, into a night of physical intimacy with you...!
No. Peter, I took your advice and sent my book to a publisher.
So there's gonna be a real live book out there with your name on it?
Well, how come you didn't just write it under Joe...
I wanted to avoid catching crap down at the police station.
Well, how else are you gonna know I'm in a box?!
Hey. You, uh... you didn't forget about our date, did you?
I was just thinking, since it's so nice out, we could go out for a run and then eat.
Oh. Yeah. N-no, no. You know, I would totally do that.
I-I just... I've already run, like, so many K today.
Hey, uh, is your vision also reduced to just a tiny pinhole?
Once you hit your runner's high, you'll catch your second wind.
Yeah, my endorphins always kick in at the top of this hill.
By the way, the sun is really a black guy.
Okay, so, uh, hi, folks, and thank you all for coming.
I know this would've been a great day to surf.
Uh, anyway, this is The Hopeful Squirrel. There once was a handicapped squirrel who could not climb trees to get food.
Okay, next page. The squirrel-- the same squirrel from the first page-- hoped that the other animals would share their food with him. 'Please,' said the Hopeful Squirrel. 'If you could all spare just one nut,
Mommy, I don't like the wheel man. But none of the other animals would share with the Hopeful Squirrel.
It's got to be like, If you could spare just one nut,
That's the man who passed out at the liquor store.
Joe, quick, give me the book. And so, the squirrel decided to climb for his own nuts. 'I don't need legs when I've got a positive attitude and arm strength.' 'I'm sorry that we mistreated you,' said Buddy the Badger. 'Could you find it in your heart to share your nuts with us?' 'Of course I'll share with you all,' said the squirrel. 'For if I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped.'
Listen, Joe, how would you feel about your friend getting more involved? What do you mean?
Well, you would write the books, and your friend, Peter, would be the public face of The Hopeful Squirrel.
You wouldn't believe who really writes all those Stephen King books.
Look, Peter can get this book into the hands of every kid in America.
Hot Rod asked for Mr. Chicago. Give me all your money. I have a gun?
Oh, wait, I think I messed something up. Never give up on your dreams?
I need to know that you're gonna take this seriously and honor the message of the book.
Our guest on today's show is local bestselling children's book author David Chicago.
So, tell me, how did you decide to write about a handicapped squirrel?
You know, I'd see these crippled kids limping down the sidewalk on my way to work, and I would just laugh and laugh, and I thought, Hey! Put that in a book!
I'll tell you what he's doing, he's selling books! They love him!
Now, I understand we have some questions from the audience.
But in the book, I'm drawn smooth down there, so it's not a bad question.
We invite you to stay tuned through the credits so you can see where I buy my clothes.
Wow, Brian, you sure have been doing a lot of jogging lately.
Ah, no-no offense, Lois, but that stuff is nothing but chemicals and empty calories.
Okay. I'll mush some up and put it on the floor next to the trash, if you get hungry.
You know, in case any of you want to, uh, come cheer us on,
Chloe and I are doing the Quahog Marathon in a couple weeks.
I'm just gonna give it all I've got, like Scotty engineering the Enterprise.
Uh... Captain, this uh... this is a little embarrassing, but, uh, you know, I've never noticed, uh, the little lever I've been pushing, it's... it's only about two-thirds of the way up.
I've just been thinking about this-this giving her all she's got thing.
I mean, think of how many crises we've been in where the issue was how fast we could go.
At the funeral, I literally said the words to his wife, I was giving her all she's got.
W-We don't have enough dilithium crystals to run the phasers
You're getting kids to laugh at handicapped people, when I'm trying to inspire them.
And besides, I'm the only one of the two of us who can do a squirrel voice.
I want nothing to do with the book, and I want nothing to do with you!
Aw, one of his shoes fell off during the anger.
Did you just poop and then get into bed without underwear on?
Now the publisher wants another book and it's all on me!
I just hate to see you two in a fight.
And on the same week when my sister and I are having such a big fight, too.
What if the squirrel has lasers... that he shoots out of his eyes!
And how 'bout he got a frog friend that's got some sort of catchphrase?
Like, if he's seeing something kooky, he could be like, Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!
Hey, Stewie! Can you come in the bathroom for a second?
I got, like, eight more nipples to cover up before my run.
Stewie, my heart rate is down to four beats a minute.
Do you remember that phase when you thought you were a pointer dog?
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, hot moms who are married but looking...
Hey, how many of y'all bitches like to read? Chapter One. It was winter in the forest, so the squirrel was happy he'd built that hot tub. But little did he know, a strain of super gonorrhea was gonna hit him so fierce he'd wish he was still paralyzed from the waist down. On top of that, some son of a bitch killed his brother. The monkey's kick-ass buzz saw hand 'His brains, his brains-- they're everywhere!' the little girl yelled. 'Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!' ...exclaimed Billy the Bullfrog. The woodchuck mom and her baby finished their cocoa and then tucked in for another cozy night.
But then... 'Nothing but cops on the take and hookers on the make,' said Randy the Raccoon. 'What's a hooker?' asked the bunny, who was gay. 'That and a bag of crank is my Saturday night!' spat Randy.
I'm sorry Joe's dream didn't work out for you, Peter.
Me trying to write a book is like CeeLo trying to find a pair of pants.
Yeah, I need to find something a cartoon apple would wear.
Brian, I think you've taken all of this too far.
You know, there is such a thing as too much exercise.
And no offense, but I'm not taking advice from a guy who eats bread.
I just got so wrapped up in all the attention.
I know how much this meant to you, and I... I should've just stayed out of it.
If I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped.
I never would have had the confidence to get my book published in the first place.
I'm just saying, you probably have an itchy ankle under that cast.
It starts as a tickle and then you can't quite reach it?
Even though it might be a little bug digging away down there, just nagging and itching and...
It just goes to show you, Lois, books is bad news.
Well, except for the books they sell at Urban Outfitters.
We now return to Hotel TV, the station that makes you feel like you're at a hotel when you're not at a hotel.
Or you can watch the big game at Chopper's Bar and Grill, where they'll be pouring till 2:00 a.m.
Or maybe you're in the mood for something a little more exotic.
With rooftop views, plus a fine selection of blended rum drinks.
At the end of the night, you won't want to say, Boa noite.
And you won't have to, 'cause Chopper's is open, where they're pouring till 2:00 a.m.
We interrupt this program to bring you a Chanel 5 News special report.
Tragedy stuck Haiti today as the island nation was rocked by a major earthquake, leaving thousands dead and injured.
Coming up, local newsman shows a camera operator how to center a shot.
Relax. I'm sure Wyclef Jean has got it all under control.
I've always talked about wanting to help in these situations, but I never follow through.
We shall stand our ground and fight them to the death!
Although... I mean, one of us should probably warn everyone.
Wow, Lois, you really got a great turnout for the blood drive. Oh, yeah.
Well, except for that mosquito who keeps trying to sneak in.
Oh, look, an empty tire with some water in it.
I'm gonna go ahead and thank you for donating blood today.
Oh. Well, if I got to donate, he's got to donate, too.
It's called Apathetic George. George used to be a curious monkey, but after a month in captivity, all he did was wait for food. The zoo people wanted him to mate, but he lost interest in that, too. 20 years and millions of dollars in zoo revenue later, he died.
I know something that will help you sleep. Wait here.
Sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and good night!
It's cough syrup. It's not really for kids, but a capful is pretty harmless.
Oh, so this is what Lil Wayne keeps almost dying from.
Like the way I got used to wearing European diapers.
If anybody needs me, I'll be poolside next to my weirdly hot girlfriend with dark teeth.
Peter, knock it off. Just give some blood, get your cookie and be done with it.
Well, I already ate two wedding cakes, but I guess I could go for a cookie.
Thanks, Lois, but you got to promise you'll warn me before they stick that needle in me.
Yeah, I found one of my grandmother's old recipes, so I thought I'd make a special batch for the blood drive.
Coming this fall to every network, your favorite sitcom lines preceded by the word uh.
If we sold these, we could make a ton of money.
I mean, if George Foreman can make electric grills, we can do this.
I mean, I've seen that guy get punched in the face a thousand times, and now he's making science stuff.
Who'd think that idiot would still be walking around and Muhammad Ali can't even talk anymore?
You know, having our own store could be kind of fun.
I always wanted you and me to work on a project together.
All right! Now, let's turn up the TV real loud so the kids can't hear us having sex.
Now, we can't be late for our meeting with the bank.
That's so cool you guys are gonna open a business.
I mean, I had that job creating ads for the North Dakota board of tourism.
Hi. Do you like South Dakota but don't want to see Mount Rushmore?
It's just a very long drive from wherever you live.
Best of all, most of the good license plates aren't taken yet.
Imagine coming here and having Cool Dude or Yay Jews or Boo Jews, depending on where you stand on Jews.
I've been... I've been looking all over the table for you.
You know, I've got to tell you, this stuff you gave me was a lifesaver last night.
And, you know, normally, I'm up five or six times to scream and defecate. But you know what?
Oh, Brian's all serious. Oh, I don't... I don't drink in the morning because I've got to land a plane.
All right, come on, I've got to drive you to daycare.
I think I've put my shoes on the wrong feet.
You know, I've got all the papers for the loan officer, but, I got to admit, I'm a little nervous.
And if you get nervous, just do what I always do, picture your audience naked.
I'll be your loan officer, so why don't you have a seat and tell me about your business.
Uh, my husband and I would like to open a cookie store.
We've done all the research, and I'm very confident we can turn a profit.
I've brought some samples if you'd like to try one.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, this bank would like to help you start your business.
And if you have any other questions, you can call me at any time.
Let's order... I was just thinking, let's order a kebab.
But I... but I want it in this order: vegetable, meat, meat, vegetable, meat.
No, no, Bri... No, you can't. Brian, I need your help.
I've made a series of small poops in my bath, and I need you to scoop them out with this fishnet.
I know, but wouldn't it be great if you were?
In fact, the only thing that would make me happier is... would... is... would be if this tub was filled with yawgurt.
Is there... is there some place to dial up yawgurt?
Who can... who can prepare me a nice yawgurt treatment?
If you say it like that one more time, I'm gonna drown you.
Now all we got to do is name the store.
You know, we did so-so building a family, but this business--
I think we can really knock it out of the park.
Like Moses and his buddy who liked to collect seashells.
All right. Well, we have got work to do, so let's roll up our sleeves and get right to it.
There's a lot to do, so we can't be afraid to just roll up our sleeves and get the job done.
We got to roll up our sleeves and just dig in.
You got to do the work of two men and pay yourself for one.
Just roll up those sleeves and address the task at hand, whatever it may be, not shying away from the dirty work, but just rolling up our sleeves and having at it.
It's time to get in the game and get dirty.
What, Mom? You promised I could get a cookie if I finished all my surgery.
It's that lady who comes in, tries a sample, and then whispers about how bad she is. Hey.
But at least I know I'm bad, so that makes me a little less bad.
I mean, if it doesn't pick up soon, we're not gonna stay in business very long.
We just got to think outside the box, like the makers of Dreyer's ice cream.
Guys, I've said it before, and I'll say it again:
When people go to the supermarket, they need something to look at before they choose Haagen-Dazs.
Hey, dude, can you pass me a speck of Spazz?
My God, what does it take to get people to buy a damn cookie?
I spend $600 a month on scented candles at the farmer's market just because there's a hot chick selling them.
Trust me, you get a few hotties in that cookie shop of yours,
It's way better than that job I had telemarketing to buttholes.
And don't worry, I only hired women whose names are cookie-related.
Well, it was twice as much, but I had to bail out Cinnamon's kid.
Just you watch, we'll be a bigger success than Richard Branson.
It couldn't be that tan, long-haired guy with the white linen pants, could it?
This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.
They're all watching Sugar write frosting swears on her jugs.
I told her ten minutes ago to put another batch of oatmeal in the oven.
I warmed it up and put it behind those waist-high holes in the wall.
I know we made a few changes, but this store should still be about selling cookies.
I don't know why I ever let you talk me into this... this... whatever this is now.
I should've known something was up when I saw all those cars out front.
Stewie, why don't you come and have a seat with all your friends here?
I'll go first. Stewie, I remember the day you were born. I thought to myself, here's a kid who's got a white, empty canvas stretched out in front of him.
What is this... What is this, the circle of perfect people?
Mis-Mister... Mister Giraffe, who lets l-little boys grind on his rump.
Mr. Octopus, who lets little boys grind on his rump.
Yeah, but you're the only one who almost killed a kid yesterday.
'Cause, because that kid... That's because... because that... 'ca... because that kid... that kid...
I don't have a cough, and my sinuses are remarkably wide open.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to Chris's room.
I got a bunch of his friends sitting in a circle in there...
Lois, before you say anything, there's something important I want to tell you.
After you left, I ate cookie dough off the stomach of a 20-year-old, and then I vomited and all the girls laughed at me, and then it came out that they all think I'm fat and old.
Oh, back at the store, I, uh, tucked my boner into the waistband of my pants and now it's sitting weird.
I really liked having a store with you, and I'm... I'm sorry I messed it up.
Uh, I wouldn't. Butter helped me with it, and she has chlamydia fingers.
But from now on, my cookies are only for these customers.
So, Mom, what are you gonna do with the shop?
Aw, man, that's gonna leave a big hole in their lineup.
In place of Glory, we will be showing Shaft, starring Richard Roundtree.
What? You can't just shove Shaft in the Glory hole.
Yeah, I know. It'd be better to put in that movie about the two girls who meet Nixon.
But if you also put in Edward Furlong's movie, Pecker, you got Pecker and Dick in the Glory hole, and you got a tight squeeze, but it-it ought to fit.
Come on, Brian, I need this rope in case I open a nautical-themed restaurant.
We got boat parts on the wall, so you know the crab comes from the ocean.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to make that trade.
I thought I wanted to make that trade, but I don't want to make that trade.
He's still trying to get that rope away from Brian.
All right, but I'll be back in a moment as another movie thing.
I told you this is mine! You're never gonna get it!
Just give me the rope. Nobody has to get hurt, Brian.
This has to be the stupidest thing you've ever done.
No, Brian. The stupidest thing I ever did was turn the bubbles off in a hot tub.
Now, remember, Brian's probably very self-conscious about how he looks, so let's try to be supportive.
You got to take me to the dentist to get my mouth fixed.
Brian, we can try to make you feel a little less repulsive, but we're not spending human money on a deformed animal.
I don't know. But here, you can have this back.
Wow, this is the craziest meal I've had since I had lunch at Tommy Sullivan's house.
Hey, listen, thanks for not laying into me like everybody else.
I don't care enough about you to lay into you.
But now that you mention it, your face looks like a used condom.
He sells me nitrous at wholesale, I bang his wife.
Now get the hell out of the bar, you pathetic son of a bitch.
I know I didn't just hear what that man said.
We now return to My Dinner with Andre the Giant.
I could never give up my electric blanket; it's cold in New York City.
You may argue that this is a waste of energy, but to me, it's worth the comfort because, let's face it, the world is an abrasive place.
I have maybe hours to live, and you're wasting them.
Yeah, Brian, you are gonna get so much sweet tail!
That is the best cosmetic surgery in this family since Lois got her boob job.
Okay, but do you think this house will hold its value?
And the yard's got plenty of room for little ones.
Hey, so sorry I'm late. Let me show you the house.
No need to. Your partner already sold us on it.
Sorry, I-I didn't realize they thought I was a real estate agent.
You are a real estate agent; you just don't know it yet.
Every other divorced mom at my kid's school is a realtor.
Bonnie, I still don't get why you want to see this house.
I mean, the-the whole house is slanting down to that cliff over there.
Now, I am obligated to disclose that the previous owners were murdered in this house.
I just don't know if this is the right time to buy.
Hello, Doctor? I need a new pair of eyes because clearly mine aren't seeing straight.
Is this the guy who wanted his pulse checked because he died and went to heaven?
The only thing is, anyone can sell a nice house, but a real star is someone who can sell a dump.
Well, we got this crap condo down by the marina.
We haven't been able to unload it in two years.
You find some sucker to buy it, and I'll make you partner.
God, there's got to be a sucker to buy this condo.
I just hit 20 years in the air, and I got a big bonus.
For the first time in my life, I got money to burn.
I didn't know you worked out at this gym, too.
I'm glad I bumped into you because I've been meaning to give you something.
I just wish I could do something more for you.
The one thing they're pretty firm about at the office is you don't take the inside deals and give them to your friends.
What... What kind of inside deal are you talking about?
All I can say is... underpriced waterfront property that's guaranteed to appreciate in value.
I mean, I didn't think I'd ever be friends with Ice-T.
Come live in the kind of place a Persian guy would say is a little much.
The ceiling is a pool. The ceiling is a pool.
I don't know about buying a place without seeing it first.
But as your friend, I wanted to let you know early because there's another buyer who's about to snap it up.
Say what you want, but he's got an eye for real estate. Let me just give him a call and let him know he's gonna get the place.
Like I did when I wanted to get out of that boring meeting.
Third quarter projections indicate our sales will be down 40%.
Why don't we go through the profit-loss statement line by line from the past six quarters, which will offer us a good cost analysis comparison that I think we'll be able to utilize as we move forward - Aah! into the next fiscal year.
I got a nosebleed, and, uh, I don't work here.
All right, Quagmire, now when you introduce us to the ladies by the pool,
I'm a millionaire, Joe's a war hero, and Cleveland is Magic Johnson.
It's probably nothing, but there's a stain on the rug in the shape of a little kid.
I don't know if you want this now, but I bought you a mini cactus.
That's why I've never made any major investments with my dog.
Here it is. You've got to rescind the purchase. State law.
Thank God. I got to go tell Brian the deal's off.
I'm still within 72 hours, and I want to get out of my contract.
This sounds like a discussion to have over a cone-shaped cup of water.
You can drink from these and then put 'em on your head to be a clown from an Italian opera.
All of this because I'm singing in a pointy hat.
Look, Mr. Griffin's not here, but if you leave your name,
I'm gonna be harder to find than a nice cat.
I'm gonna be Buffalo Bill, and you're gonna be a great big fat person.
After that, he won't be able to pull out of that deal.
Well, if anybody knows how to pull out, it's Quagmire.
I have a lot of fun up here in my room.
There you are. I've been looking all over for you.
That's why you've been hiding from me in this motel?
Now let me out of this deal and give me my money back.
Look, i-if you're not happy with your current property, we could roll your money over into something in Sinkhole Estates.
You know, when you were poor, you were always a douche, but at least you came by it honestly.
And you're the only guy in town who's ever called me out on my crap.
You know, I used to hate you for it, but... now I think you're the only person who was trying to be my friend.
Even though I know you never liked me, you still helped me when I really needed it.
You're honest, and direct, and compassionate, and... that is 72 hours.
Wow, so I guess that's it for you and real estate, huh, Brian?
Oh, yeah, it's real hard being a real estate agent.
I mean, you got to be able to count bathrooms.
I once beat a real estate agent in a game of chess.
First of all, I didn't have any clean underwear this morning, so I had to wear a bathing suit.
Then I missed the bus, of course. Then it looked like it was gonna start to rain. Luckily, it didn't.
Live from New York City, it's the JCPenney Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Yeah, it's like the Macy's parade, only without licensed characters.
You want to tell me what the hell happened to our Thanksgiving turkey?
Uh, well, last night, Brian and I got drunk and ate the turkey.
But before you get mad, we also ate the salad.
Peter, we've got a houseful of people coming and they're expecting a turkey.
Yeah, we'll be back with a turkey faster than you can say, Jack Robinson.
She had a stroke that killed the part of her brain that says Jack Robinson.
All right, Brian, first order of business-- we have to decide who gets to ride in the cart and who has to push it.
We've been to every grocery store in town with no luck. are these little packets of weird vitamins that vaguely suggest they help you in the bedroom. Performance and stamina, for men.
The packet says I got to play till I'm raw.
Can't believe every turkey within a 60-mile radius of Quahog is sold out.
I know. And now we're so far from home, none of your stations even work.
It's not that good of a song, but we know it.
No. And why are you saying the dog's name before Dad's?
Well, the fat man's never going to get back in time, and with him gone, that makes you the man of the house.
I'm just saying, without Peter here, you're going to have to be the host of Thanksgiving.
You have to do everything the fat man normally would.
You mean, like, fall asleep on the toilet and have a big red ring on my bum for a week?
Boy, yesterday I'm microwaving a cat, today I'm giving a speech.
You have to know me to know I'm just joking.
Sir, the day we've had, we could use a good chuckle like that.
Lois would be madder than that time she got a Capp smear.
All right, we're just going to take a quick Capp smear.
No, at this hospital we obtain the sample using beloved British comic strip roustabout Andy Capp.
Okay, you know what? I'm in charge of the turkey.
I swear to God, I thought dogs could breathe underwater.
You have to spend time with me without looking at your phone.
If you want, I can take you as far as the bus station.
Oh, that is the nicest thing anyone's done for me since my kids gave me that Father's Day gift.
All right, Chris, acting as host will demand a higher level of conversation.
Ugh, this is gonna be a bigger disaster than Y2-Gay.
All right, we'll ride it, but pray to God nobody from school sees us.
To the car wash to raise money for our new soccer uniforms.
Nickelodeon-- casually ask your daughter what that girl's name is, then take your laptop into the bathroom.
We brought some wine, but it's good wine so it's just or us.
Damn it. Where the hell are they with that turkey?
Hi, you've reached Brian Griffin of The Write Stuff writing classes...
You broke the chain and now we have to walk!
I can't go back to my wife without a turkey!
Okay, buddy, you ready to test out those hosting skills?
I should check if your mother needs help in the kitchen.
You can't always get things right on the first try.
Yeah, but can we just talk for a second about how brave I was when we walked past that cemetery?
Peter, do you not see that we are completely screwed here?
You drove my car into a lake, you almost let me drown, you got us thrown off a bus, you broke our bike, and now you've gotten our turkey stolen and Thanksgiving is ruined and we don't have any transportation and we're still miles from home!
You're starting to get black gums like an older dog.
You know what? You know what? Maybe it's my fault.
Well, if I'm so stupid, then how did I manage to frame you for eating the turkey?
Didn't you notice you were passed out in all those photos?
I just posed you like that because I didn't want to take all the blame.
You son of a bitch! How could you do that to me?
I can throw you off a bridge, and as long as I don't hit a person on a boat, it's okay.
You've got no turkey, and now you've got no friend.
I don't know why I ever listen to that jerk.
No way. We're a team, Brian, whether you like it or not.
Just like almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves.
Too bad, because your recently divorced mom has a crush on her trainer, and he eats like this, so now you have to, too.
Almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves-- just like PB and J, but with more of your mom railing this guy.
We stopped being a team when you framed me for eating that turkey with you.
Brian, maybe you should be a little less mad at me and a little more mad at the guys growing mustaches for this month.
Last year, I raised eight dollars and got on a BuzzFeed listicle.
We break into the zoo, steal a turkey, bring it home, we're heroes.
I mean, you're looking at the guy who found the Fountain of Youth.
Hey, Lois, thanks for letting Kevin bring his girlfriend this year.
And I hope it's not awkward that she's a little person and they viciously fight all the time.
Why do we have to spend every holiday with your family?
Don't you worry. This'll quickly turn into rough, front-yard, makeup sex.
As the oldest guy here, it's my duty to take an open mouth nap in the middle of the room.
I thought we could all take turns telling a long story about how things aren't the way they used to be.
You go to the ballpark, get your bag of Bulls-eyes and watch Hack Wilson round the bases in a big wool shirt.
I once saw Hack hit a ball out of the infield.
I still remember the thud of the bat and the whoosh of the wool.
All right, Chris, this is where you, as host, need to step in and...
Oh, come on, get up! They need you down there.
Hey, buddy, you want to come to my house so my wife can cook you wrong?
Shouldn't you be in Detroit losing a football game right now?
I mean, for God's sake, I sank your car in a lake.
But, hey, we cut the legs off him and dye him brown, we got ourselves a turkey, right?
Hey, you got a tiny head and a big body.
Up on the right are the people with the awesome trampoline, but they don't let me on it no more,
And, Daddy, what about the pants that kids today are wearing?
I have an interesting factoid about what makes you sleepy afterwards.
So it's fallen to me to take up the mantle.
Now, I wasn't planning on doing this today, but when I look around at all of these open, loving faces or friends and family,
I am comfortable enough to finally say that I am a proud, unashamed, active...
Look, Lois, I still got time to make this right.
Hand me a nine iron and show me to the backyard.
I wish you didn't have to die, but a bunch of white people put on sweaters.
I know you wanted the perfect Thanksgiving, and I know I screwed that all up for you, but when you think about it, isn't this holiday about being with people you love?
The man of the house killed a turkey for Thanksgiving!
You can always tell which fathers are disappointed in their sons because they eat lunch with their coats still on.
Yeah, you got anything for a poor fat person who wants to look like a rich fat person?
Now, I'll mostly be hitting on waitresses who are too young and thin to ever be interested in me.
Hey, sorry to bother you, but would you like to work here?
All right, now let me just take off these security tags for you.
You know Jeff Garlin has one of these in his house.
It's only infinity times what you bring home every week.
Well, I felt kind of bad about how we left things.
And although I will never get over the pain of what you did to my son, I forgive you, because I believe you are sick and in need of help.
You requested a variance to build a hot tub off your garage.
Why don't you come over to my place for a beer or something?
Hey, you want me to pick anything up on the way over or no, you're good?
Yeah, I don't have any cash, but we'll figure it out.
Huh, I think half the world would be surprised to know that.
This is not too... too... it's not... it's not too... not too good.
Yeah, I know it's nothing fancy, but, you know, I'm not really into material possessions.
Hey, how come you aren't with your family during Christmas, anyway?
And besides, my dad always spends Christmas at his time-share in Coral Gables with his girlfriend.
Great, here comes that couple with the adult disabled kid.
I-I'm Ken, this is Pam, and this right here is Scott.
We really want to thank you, God, for testing us.
But the good news is, this little guy's gonna make it to 74.
And if I remember correctly, isn't your birthday sometime soon, too?
I'll probably just reheat some ramen and watch Grey's Anatomy.
No way. I'm not gonna let my pal Jesus spend his birthday like that.
All right, guys, here's what I'm thinking-- a whole festival of muddy boobs.
That's a good way to get those muddy boobs moving.
All right, you guys, Jesus's birthday party is gonna be epic.
Hey, since it's also Christmas, maybe we could make it, like, a Christmas theme.
Come on, guys, we don't have to make such a big thing about it.
It's not like I'm a woman who's about to turn 30.
You guys, I don't care what we do for my birthday, as long as it lasts the whole week and is very expensive and inconvenient for all my friends.
Oh, and I'm gonna dress like a slut and be rude to everyone for no reason.
I don't care that your dad's dying, we're all going to Montreal for the week.
If we're planning a party, we haven't even talked about the most important thing.
Even Martin Lawrence when he used to dress up like Shenehneh?
They come back to your house and sit on your... butt.
Well, in high school, my best friend was this hot prostitute, and I just kind of got into the friend zone.
She's all like, Oh, there's all these guys having sex with me for money.
Your 2,000-year-long cold streak is about to come to an end.
I'm saying, Jesus, we are gonna help you lose your virginity.
All right, me and the guys are off to help Jesus lose his virginity.
Just put it in the oven for half an hour at 350.
That's what you always say when you leave the house.
Just some random slut to maul in a bar back where the payphones used to be.
All right, Jesus, these speed date nights are the best way to meet a lot of chicks fast.
This is kind of embarrassing, but are you okay with someone who smokes?
A-Are you okay with someone who wanders the desert, lecturing people on how to act?
All right, Jesus, nowadays, everything is done on the Internet.
All right? So, we got to get you on Facebook.
Uhp, let me just close a couple of these windows.
Yeah, I like to pretend it's mine down there what's doing all the slapping.
Peter, Jesus is never gonna find a woman going about it your way.
I think it's time I had a little talk with him so he knows what a woman really wants.
Jesus, I asked you to lunch because I think you've been getting bad advice about finding a special someone.
Well, Peter's been doing his best, but lately he seems more focused on marketing his erotic Advent calendar.
You just have to be yourself and let a sweet girl see that side of you.
You're sensitive, you died for our sins and ascended into Heaven, and you got nice skin.
Don't be afraid to be honest with a girl and show her who you are.
We just got to be more creative about getting Jesus laid.
I just tell folks to go down to the Happy Handy Smile Massage and get it over with.
I sometimes go down there, and when they tell me I'm done, I leave.
Hey, guys. Uh, Peter, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure.
I've found the woman who I'd like to lose my virginity to.
It's someone who understands me and someone I feel very close to.
Actually, Peter, I want my first time to be with...
But probably not as outraged as the ten million Christians watching.
Maybe we can both stop these Hollywood Jew writers from wrecking my marriage and your religion.
I just know Lois would make my first experience as special and memorable as it should be.
Yup. Never been more sure of anything in my life.
Why? What's wrong with our marriage? What's wrong with our marriage?
Clearly, there's been a lot of cheating on both sides, but the point is where do we go from here?
Doesn't the Bible say not to covet thy neighbor's wife?
Oh, come on, Lois, the Bible's just a bunch of general guidelines.
It's one of those things that seems bad, but really is good.
Like that fracking company we let drill in the backyard.
Well, I guess it is kind of an honor that out of all the people in the world,
And-and the Son of God's first time should be special.
As sure as I was when I created Lady Gaga.
You're an atheist, and the one guy you don't believe in is getting to bang the woman of your dreams.
You know what? I don't have to sit here and take this.
I'm sorry, I was just coming down the stairs at the same time.
Well, we know he's circumcised, so she won't have to deal with that nonsense.
I've only grazed it once and that was with a running start.
I'll take it over here on my Brookstone massage chair.
Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie, he'd give me back the use of my legs?
Joe, I don't speak for Jesus. I just get him trim.
It was bought for me by Jesus, but now he's doing my wife!
Guys! I think I might've made a terrible mistake with this whole Lois and Jesus thing!
I always thought it was sort of a strange choice to let Jesus have relations with your wife.
I'm sorry, did you say Jesus is sleeping with your wife?
Great, now everybody knows my wife is taking Jesus's virginity.
Yeah, Jesus did the same thing to my wife Christmas before last and my buddy's wife the year before that.
Nah, he just acts lonely and lies about being a virgin so he can get with guys' wives.
He just uses it to store art he bought on cruises.
Peter, maybe there's still time! Maybe you can stop them!
Now for a slippy, no-boots run through the snow to my car.
No! Jesus is about to have sex with my wife!
Jesus Christ is about to have sex with my wife!
Lenny Kravitz is about to have sex with my daughter!
A rabbit's foot, a penknife, a bottle cap, a compass...
But I seen our Lord and Savior bring a lady in there for a Christmas rodgering, I did.
I realized I don't want other people humping my wife for a chair.
He put actual strawberries in a glass of champagne, which was about the classiest, sexiest thing I'd ever seen.
Oh, you know, uh... that, uh, this holiest of days is about, uh, appreciating... our loved ones and, uh, resisting... temptation.
Uh, well, I can see my work here is done.
Well, Lois, I'm sure glad you didn't have sex with the Messiah.
Oh. A Joni Mitchell CD. To continue your emotional education.
You are watching Amazon Prime, the network that brought you your sunscreen in two days.
Amazon Prime-- like the eighth best way to watch TV.
Bet it's from a girl in the lunchroom who wants a taste of corn dog.
I guess your father and I will have to talk to the principal and figure out how to handle this.
Chris seems to be struggling in his classes, and often when kids have trouble in school, it's because something is going on at home.
I haven't been attracted to Lois for a year and a half.
I-I always knew Chris wasn't a great student, but I had no idea the situation was so dire.
The same way NASA counted on me during the Apollo 13 crisis.
All right, I'm gonna need three coffins-- mahogany with brass handles-- three new daddies for the dead astronauts' kids, and a black suit for me.
Sir, I think I know a way we can get them back.
Yeah, we-we've kind of already decided we're going in this direction.
All right, Chris, you got a lot riding on this history exam tomorrow.
Sam Cooke didn't know much about history, and he got shot in a hotel wearing nothing but a sports coat and a shoe.
Yeah, that's hilarious, Chris, but we've got to buckle down.
Now, I'm gonna help you study by nailing your door shut.
That way, you'll have no choice but to hit the books.
Dad, it looks like some girl sent you a picture of her privates.
All right, give me that phone and get back to work.
And before you judge your mother-- you did most of that damage.
You guys, I've been at this all night, and I haven't learned a thing.
There's no way I'm gonna pass Mr. Harpington's history test.
Who said, We have nothing to fear but fear itself?
And if I fail ninth grade, I won't amount to anything.
I'll end up being one of those bus drivers that parents don't completely trust.
He's studying as hard as he can, but it doesn't seem to matter.
If he doesn't pass this test, he's gonna have to...
Maybe there's a way to actually show Chris history... with my time machine.
Okay, who wants to taste it, and who wants to smell it?
All right, we'll just tell Chris he's dreaming, because I don't want him to know about my time machine.
Once people know you got one, there go your weekends.
All right, let's go back six minutes and try this again.
We're gonna take you on a special dream trip to help you pass your history test.
For example, did you know that Jesus didn't really die on the cross?
All right, I've got the return pad, and the time machine is powering up right now.
Oh, hey, come on, guys. Who built what is not a question on the history final, right?
How much of my stuff have you taken credit for?!
All right, Chris, I reviewed your textbook, and I've programmed a tour of the various historical events that you'll need to know for your exam.
He's trying to convince Congress to approve the Louisiana Purchase.
This bar is where famous American writers, like Ernest Hemingway, would go for a drink.
Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway, can I have a beer with you?
I would love to talk to you about the craft.
I mean, God, if only we could get rid of these damn arms and attach the pen directly to the heart, right?
Now, Chris, this is Brazil before the invention of the soccer ball.
Hey, Family Guy, you're lucky I got a manicotti in the oven, or I'd bash your face into a bolognese.
The father of our nation, George Washington, is about to boldly cross the Delaware.
All right, Chris, it's 1798, and we're in the home of Jane Austen.
Oh, I know-- we're just here to release pent-up time-travel farts.
Sir, please, take this money and use it to pursue your dreams.
All right, Chris, let's discuss what you've learned so far.
That you can't take a good nap with keys in your pocket.
You clearly have not paid attention to anything we've shown you!
Did you ever consider-- the reason you're having trouble passing ninth grade is that you're incapable of anything else?!
Damn it, Chris, your problem isn't book learning, it's that you're a moron!
This whole trip has been a complete waste of time!
And I'm gonna win that bowling tournament, with or without you!
I don't know what the hell we're going to do.
If I'm such a moron, then how did I get on a fancy boat?!
We'll just go back in time to before Chris ran off.
Okay, now we've really got to get on that ship.
Oh, thank God, I wasn't sure we were gonna make it.
Come on, Stewie, we got to find Chris and the return pad before it's too late.
I'll go search in first class, you go down to steerage and wade through the gross Irish and Italians.
Excuse me, have any of you seen a blond teenage boy?
Everyone at this table was the first person to refrigerate something.
Also, I gave the string quartet the sheet music for Highway to the Danger Zone.
You have the sheet music for Highway to the Danger Zone?
I did-- he wasn't in the Turkish bath, the veranda café or the Bloody Handkerchief Ball.
I'm gonna go ahead and bet he's the guy with the whole chicken stuck on his head.
I know this thing's gonna sink, but I'm having a good time.
The Titanic was one of the biggest disasters in history.
Well, if you're so worried, why don't you alert the crew and save everyone?
Besides, saving this ship would mean talking to, like, 80 people, and I-I'm just not in that kind of mood right now.
Look, Chris, just give us that thing you took so we can all get home.
I'll need to dry it out and completely rewire it.
And the parts I need to fix the return pad certainly aren't on this ship.
I've never even successfully made love to a woman in the shower.
The majority of people who got on those lifeboats were women of noble birth.
I am Lady Antonia Tyler Carrington, the Duchess of Lancashire, the heir to the Earl of Portsmouth, and the cousin of the Countess of Wessex.
Uh, yeah, but it's got one of those funny Southwest lifeboat attendants.
Hey, here's a reminder-- as you exit the boat, don't forget to give us your extra snacks because as you know, we work for peanuts!
Um, what if one of us were to turn this big ship into a tug boat?
You're the fourth person to offer that, and I'm kind of spent.
Get out of my way, you son of a bitch!
I'm not someone who often makes mistakes, but, well, I was wrong earlier when I called you a moron.
You're the smart one in the family, and I'm the dumb one.
Look, you may not be book smart or history smart, but you're throw people off the boat smart.
And, frankly, I'm starting to think that's the best kind to be.
Well, looks like one ship was saved today-- a relation-ship.
It was still a nice thing you did for your brother.
I just hope that Chris killing one extra man on the Titanic didn't alter anything in the present.
Hallmark Original Pictures presents an instant family classic: Summers With My Slow Brother, starring a cast of people who make you say Oh, because you didn't think they were still acting.
Remember what happened the last time I had to choose between you and the TV.
I haven't been doing well on these practice tests, and I need to improve my score to get into a good college.
You should be much more concerned about your weight than your SAT scores.
I'll get the scissors and cut that poop off your bum.
Meg, trust me, you ace these SATs, you could go on to do anything.
The SATs are this weekend, and there's no way I'm gonna get a good score.
You know, Meg, maybe you should get someone super smart to take it for you.
Not since Slick Willy Clinton lowered the nation's moral standards.
I'm just saying, find someone really smart to take the SAT for you in exchange for money.
Listen, is there any chance you'd be willing to take the SAT for me this weekend?
I don't know what you've been doing to this thing, Neil, but you see this gunk?
All right, I'm gonna go eat a sandwich with one hand and fill out the invoice with the other.
There's got to be someone else who'd be willing to take that test for you.
You guys are my only friends, and everyone in my family's a moron.
That doesn't sound like what you said, but yeah, Brian is kind of smart.
Michael Jordan underwear commercial on a plane for some reason.
Uh, Mr. Jordan, you're gonna have to take your seat and stop asking people about their underwear.
That's the acronym I use for Faster Than the Speed of Love, because I mention it so much.
Anyway, I was just rereading my favorite passage the other day. The weight of the gun in Jason's hand surprised him.
I can't believe Amazon is dumping it for 99 cents.
I thought you'd be the perfect person to maybe take the SAT for me.
Well, I suppose you may look at it that way.
But a wise book once said, With the heart at stake, right and wrong is a stake through the heart.
I guess what I'm saying is, Ace Pilotson, reporting for World War Love.
I've got a whistle, a cloth helmet, a key to a call box, a soft rubber truncheon, and a map of the city. Please hurry!
Meg, I thought we were gonna try to work on that.
Hey, other teens, how about our youth culture, am I right?
I was afraid I'd stick out, like the one guy in Lincoln's cabinet who didn't have a beard.
I want to win this war, and I want to do it fast. Ideas?
Yes, and use our ships to block their supply chains.
We could also use our troop advantage to out-flank them in the west.
All right, cell phones away, eyes on your own paper, and before we start, who's giving me a ride home?
What?! Damn it, why did I ever think you were smart?
I thought it was gonna be a Meg episode all throughout.
Brian took the SAT for Meg, and it turns out he's an idiot.
Hey, look, don't feel bad, Brian-- it's fun being stupid.
You don't got to worry about nothing, you don't got to read books, and you never die.
I'll show you. Come on, you're spending the day with me.
Who cares? Now, come on, we're gonna party like it's the Roaring Twenties.
Yeah, see, people go to NASCAR hoping for a crash.
But that guy could've been hurt! Why are you laughing?
'Cause it's funny! What, do you think you're better than me?
By the way, a huge part of being an idiot is constantly accusing people of thinking they're better than you.
That and forwarding mildly funny e-mails way after everybody's already seen them.
Hey, it looks like they're shooting T-shirts into the crowd.
Yeah, that's right-- I knocked your kid over to get a hot dog.
Ah, look at you, Brian, right at home with us dumb guys.
Hey, yo, Stew. My boy Peter and I are watching the Sandler movie That's My Boy.
Aw, man, I am buzzin' hardcore off of that chaw, man.
No, I mean it. How could one bad test score transform you into a complete moron?
Oh, my God! We've got to get him to a hospital!
I discovered my wife's been cheating on me for a while.
And we've removed the Matchbox car that was lodged in your rectum.
Well, keeping in mind the recent behavioral changes you've described, I did a CAT scan...
However, I'm sorry to inform you that Brian has a brain tumor.
There's only one thing to do: shrink down to microscopic size, enter Brian's brain, and destroy the tumor from within.
I am gonna sadly slide down the wall and take my hat off.
So, Doc, w... um, how much Jamba Juice do I have to drink to cure this? Um...
Dr. Hartman, do you think the brain tumor might explain why Brian's been acting so odd lately?
Hmm, well, I haven't heard of brains being linked to behavior, but I suppose anything is possible.
No, Chris, Brian is the one with the brain tumor.
Well, it says here Brian's tumor is for office use only.
Oh, Brian, that's wonderful news! You're going to be okay!
Well, since Brian's tumor poses no immediate threat, we can schedule surgery to remove it, and he'll be back to his old self in no time.
Well, I say we get that tumor out of him right away before he gets any dumber. No way.
Either take the tumor out of him or put one in me!
So i-if Brian doesn't have the surgery, will he be all right?
My point is, Brian could have the surgery and be smart again, or he could skip the surgery and stay dumb like this.
Hey, um, I was told there would be a lollipop at the end of this?
Because right now, you're as useless as Black Widow is to the Avengers.
No, I'm afraid that was a white lie to get you here, Brian.
This is the opera. I'm hoping that re-exposing you to high culture will remind you of the joys of a refined mind.
Cool. I'm sitting on my foot to hold in a dump.
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom. That's gonna be me in, like, a minute.
Lots of smart people do it instead of going to church.
And after we get done with this, you're going to talk a lot about being present and grounded.
Okay, before you say anything, no, this is not the Kenny Chesney concert.
We're here to have a nice civilized dinner and to show you that you don't have to eat all your meals in your car.
Now, we're going to start by hearing the waiter give us the specials.
Hey, cram it, skinny. Give me free food or I'm gonna tell people on Yelp there was a pube in my salad.
I forgot that Yelp is a weapon for dumb people.
Write something bad. It was the last day of summer and the first day of the rest of her life.
I need to accept the you that you want to be.
Oh, my friend Terry told me you can get high from licking paint.
Okay, well, I'm gonna go put on my python and walk to the park.
I'm trying to say that I accept your choice to forego surgery.
Hey, Brian, I started the car in the garage and it's all foggy in there.
Good Lord, if I don't do something, his stupidity will kill him.
In 50 years, we all go back to Earth and bite everybody.
I've got to convince him to get that tumor removed before it's too late.
He's an idiot, so this won't be hard at all.
Hey, Brian, you want to go see Dr. Hartman and get that procedure where you get two wieners?
That way, when I watch Black Swan, I can aim one at Natalie Portman and aim the other at...
Yes, yes, yes, we all know who the other one was. Let's go.
Well, good news, Griffins: Brian is gonna be just fine.
And if anyone wants to keep it, it's here in this Tupperware.
I-I feel like the main character of As I Lay Dying as he or she lay dying.
Oh, that's just the amount of superficial quasi-knowledge the old Brian had.
I mean, I was having fun, making new friends, getting laid all the time, sleeping like a rock, but you made the call.
You unilaterally decided I was better off a bitter alcoholic failure who can only hang out with a baby.
Big moment? Come on, Lois, he's moving from the green room to the purple room.
And just last month, we had to come here when he went into the green room from the yellow room.
I told work he was getting dialysis, so I got the whole day off.
Wow, look at that! This must be how the Tin Man felt when he finally got his heart.
And as for you, Tin Man, a 19-year-old kid in Cincinnati was struck by a drunk driver last night.
You know, it's kind of hitting me now that maybe I was thinking more metaphorically.
Oh, no-- you said you wanted a heart over and over again.
We bumped you right up to the top of the donor list.
Which means there's a father of three in Nebraska who now has a very little chance of receiving one within the next 24 hours.
Now, who wanted the brain? And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
You just happen to be the offspring of a generation that celebrates their kids for nothing.
I-I was just putting this cake in my purse for a friend.
Listen, you probably get asked this all the time, but have you ever modeled?
Here's my number-- give me a call if you're interested.
My wife said I'm not allowed to get mad at you anymore.
All right, see you later. Where are you off to?
Actually, I met a photographer at Stewie's school yesterday, and he wants me to model for him.
I believe they're defective. Oh, my God, Peter, did you just rip your own ears off?
It was the easiest way to let her know the news was ridiculous.
You know, it would be nice if you guys believed in me just once.
You know, Brian, I gave some thought to what you said the other day, and I realized you're right.
I asked Peter to read my manuscript, and he said he had to take you to dialysis.
I've spent my entire life in that ivory tower, learning from pop-up books and animal sound machines, instead of actually experiencing the world.
I'm gonna take a year off, hit the open road and live life to the fullest.
You know how good I am at making a deal.
All right, I have $50 for the first person with a paper clip and rouge in their purse.
I don't know, it's been in the purse for ages.
All right, Meg, while we take these, we can either play Freeze Frame or She Works Hard for the Money.
Well, Meg, the thing is-- my name's Evan, by the way-- a lot of people will pay good money for pictures of sexy feet.
I want to put 'em both in my mouth and then make a slapping sound on my bald head with 'em.
Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.
Now, tell us fast about your nonsense, so I can plow your mother on the staircase.
Did they take a picture of you eating a whole pizza pie next to an astonished chef?
Actually, Evan thinks I'm a natural and that I'm gonna be a huge success.
Your only chance at fame would've been as the dog on Frasier.
Well, of course I respect my father. He's a vet.
Brian, I think the road has a way of telling you where you're going.
Certainly better than that retreat we went on with the Quahog Baptist Choir.
Why don't we show our visitors how we sing what we see, y'all?
Let's just see what we see and keep it to ourselves.
Grab a pair of dirty socks and meet me by the tub of dead mice.
I've been thinking about this, and I'm not sure being a foot-fetish model is for me.
And look at these comments. Who is this? She's beautiful.
It's not often that anyone says anything nice about any part of me.
That's why I'm going to confuse you by calling it erotica.
Sometimes people just need a little encouragement to succeed, like Jason Biggs got from his grandfather.
Jason, I want you to promise me one thing-- always be forgettable.
Hey, that's just a regular unattractive guy who's not famous.
If I want to get in, I need to look the part.
Like, in case somebody bumps into me-- Oh, no worries, bro.
Stewie, there's a lot of sex and drugs at these things.
I'm tired of living my life in a tiny little box, like some sort of claustrophobic turtle.
Okay, Brian, the key to these things is to find a good position to sit on the ground.
Bring it, use it once, then put it back in the trunk for the rest of your life.
Lean back on the palms until they get weird creases.
I got to tell you, Bri, I am a big fan of sundresses.
Yeah, just waiting for a big gust of wind, right?
Yeah. Just give it a little test tap, see where she's at.
There's an animated version of you and me doing it.
Uh, I don't know. Four different bands said we've been a great crowd, so you tell me.
People keep passing out and barfing, and that barf is, like, free to take.
Well, I'll tell you this, she's got to be the second most amazing girl here, because I've met the most amazing girl.
Oh, here she comes now. Oh, here she comes now.
Wait, how can a music festival chick like two guys?
I figured all that clomping around up there was Junior Gorg from Fraggle Rock.
Meg, we know you've been doing foot porn, and that is going to stop right now.
Are you kidding? All you've done is make fun of anybody possibly thinking I could be a model.
Well, guess what, there are people out there who think I'm beautiful.
I'm going to a big party they're throwing in my honor.
Meg, don't you dare walk out that door, or you're grounded.
Let's not go crazy on the Christmas letter, okay, Lois?
Our daughter just left for some sleazy foot porn party.
I feel like we're getting invited to less stuff nowadays.
We got to find out where that party is and get Meg out of there!
Okay, that wasn't the cord, and now you've got a girl.
Just mash Brian's pill in there and smear it on the grass, he's good to go.
Now, Stewie, would you like your food served to you as an airplane or a magic bus?
Did you happen to read his tweet about jumbo shrimp?
Stewie still screams, What's happening? when he gets an erection.
Brian, why don't you show Cassandra your Boost Mobile phone?
I was thinking maybe we could all have a three-way.
We told you to take a dive in the third round, and you just kept popping back up.
Wait, how about top and bottom, or front and back?
How about I take head, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes?
Well, just 'cause she's out doesn't mean the party's over.
Oh, oh, and how she loved bleeding from her nose.
I would love if you guys would just call first.
There's a black-tie event-- that's all black and Thai chicks.
Why do you think we've been saving that VCR box in the basement?
I'm sorry your life was so screwed up that you almost had a three-way with a dog and a baby, but your life was not without meaning.
I left the comfort of the classroom to experience a world beyond books, and thanks to you, I did.
Also, I loaned you $40 for that Lumineers T-shirt, and you said you'd pay me back, so I'm gonna take your bra.
Let's go trade this bra for a couple of Gatorades.
All right, you guys, before we begin, let's sing the Japanese national anthem.
We're protecting our little girl from a lot of guys who I oddly recognize from Best Buy.
Listen, Meg, your mom and I are sorry for always putting you down.
What did you say is going on on the other side of this curtain?
Well, Brian, thanks for going on that little adventure with me, but I think I've learned quite enough from the real world for now.
I guess you're ready for the purple room after all, huh?
I saw that teacher at the concert with her boob out.
Mom, Dad, thanks for keeping me from doing something I'd always regret.
We love you, and we would never let anything bad happen to you.
Mom, I need a check for the school field trip.
Geez, Meg, didn't I just take you on a field trip?
Come save my life and nurse me back to health!
Oh, God, why do bad things happen to good people?!
'cause that's what people do before they write a check.
Okay, now let me tilt my glasses down and ask the date.
Dad, why don't your checks have any writing on them?
Lois, why don't my checks have any writing on them?
That's just a wide pad of Post-its I gave you.
What?! So that million dollar check you gave me yesterday is no good?
Lois, I want my own checkbook, and I want it now!
You got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky?
Oh, Mr. Harry, you're really not gonna like what I have to say.
Yes, I was wondering, where is the room where I can roll around nude with my money?
Okay, well, first, I'll need to see a photo I.D. and a birth certificate.
I'm living a Justin lifestyle, and so is my family.
Since I'm your cool father Justin, we should bond with skin-to-skin contact.
How about Justin takes his shirt off, and we can get some photos of you on Justin's belly?
Okay, let's go for a ride in my open Jeep.
Geez, this Justin phase of Dad's is kind of weird.
Yeah, that was me, I was the one who threw up in the sink.
I should start a Sweet News wall for stuff I think is totally sweet.
The band Guster is the sweetest band of all time.
It was tough, 'cause I had to move all my O.A.R. stuff to fit the Guster stuff.
I like to have it on my person at all times, in case I need a quick inspo sesh.
Oh, did I tell you I'm gonna be doing a lot of abbreve's?
And did you put a skateboard in the washing machine?
And I know for a fact that you haven't, either.
It's like the rest of the world just shuts off, and all that matters is you and Lady Blue.
And you know what she said to me? You're great.
That little bastard knows how to smoke pot out of an apple.
Tomorrow we're going to city hall to legally change your name back to Peter.
But I got to say, being Justin was quite an adventure.
All right, now help me grind their horns into boner pills.
I gotta go sit in my den until you leave.
Hey, Quagmire, sorry to bother you, but we're following up on a tip.
I don't want to go to jail, but I really want to take credit.
I took of her last night to all my friends.
We've got all the awesome evidence we need. Hello, my name is Glenn Quagmire. I am a neighbor of yours on Spooner Street.
I am here to inform you that I am a sex offender.
It seems as though you could have had some of that memorized.
It turns out that girl I took home from Peter's party last night is in high school.
Does this mean you're gonna move to Europe to make movies?
How in the world did you not know she was underage?
Well, in retrospect, she did ask a lot of questions about To Kill a Mockingbird.
Anyway, now I gotta go in front of a judge.
Once the girl proves her age, that's it-- you're guilty.
My only hope for leniency is to bring in character witnesses and show the court I'm not the monster they say I am.
That's why I was so good at selling low-cost car insurance.
Well, you'll tell me if I get it, though, right?
Now, Mr. Griffin, I understand you're here to speak on Mr. Quagmire's behalf.
And as we know, according to Game of Thrones, if the girl has had her blood, she is good to go.
Mr. Griffin, do you have any evidence that is not based on film or television?
I don't know. Why don't you ask all these letters to Santa Claus?
Officer Swanson, I'll remind you that you are under oath.
Now, please tell us what Mr. Quagmire said he did with the girl.
And can you please explain to the courtroom what a Frosty Jim is.
Well, it's when you urinate in a condom, and tie it off, freeze it, and then the woman, um, pretends it's a man.
Mr. Brown, can you please state your occupation for the court?
Aw, come on, man, you didn't ask anyone else to do that!
You want to know what kind of person Glenn Quagmire is?
You want to know what made me the person I am?
Look, I know everyone's sitting out there judging me today.
My dad was a military man, so he wasn't around much.
And my mom, well, let's just say, she was a little promiscuous.
In fact, I think my problems started the day I was born.
Could you put him back so I can push him out again?
The only way I learned my ABC's was by learning the names of all the guys my mom slept with.
I didn't even get to go to my high school prom.
How about I plow her in the limo and have her home in 20 minutes?
I never had a chance to be like everyone else.
My misguided carnal instincts are the result of being raised by a sexual deviant.
All I'm asking is that you give me the break that my childhood never did.
Mr. Quagmire, your story is a sad one, but that doesn't excuse your actions.
I have no choice but to sentence you to 20 years in prison.
Do you know I'm carrying three handguns, and the metal detectors picked up nothing?
Well, as the victim's mother, I ask that you go to hell!
Your Honor, I have renounced my sinful past, and have been washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I have seen the righteous path of our Savior, and ask that you not sentence my son to jail, but instead release him to my custody so that I, with God's guidance, can rehabilitate him.
I haven't been this surprised since we went to that restaurant on my birthday.
All right, guys, let's pay the check and get out of here.
Mr. Quagmire, I'll give you 24 hours to get your affairs in order.
I know this is a hard time for you, but you need to seek forgiveness.
Oh, he's gonna be kneeling in front of a lot of guys, but I doubt he'll catch their names.
How dare you come in here and tell me to seek forgiveness!
You've never apologized once for the way you raised me!
Oh, come on, Quagmire, you're a grown man, responsible for his own choices.
Seems kind of cowardly to blame someone else for your problems.
Why are you, of all people, defending a religious nut?
Glenn, we're not going to get anywhere questioning God's wisdom.
So you can absolve yourself of any responsibility and answer everything with empty platitudes.
Face it, you're a worse parent than Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.
They've been raised with 11 languages, and really don't speak any.
This is your chance to open your heart and let God in.
And maybe through our shared relationship with the Lord, we can begin to build a bond as mother and son. Mother and son?!
I'd rather rot in jail than sit here and listen to all your crap!
You know, some families take their baby to the zoo.
And I'll think of you whenever I choke on a link sausage.
I want you to hold onto my antique, gold Rolex watch.
No, no, Peter, it-- and I cannot stress this enough-- it is not a throwing watch.
And-and Joe, you sure you don't mind taking care of my cat?
I-I-I meant, take care of her, like, look after her!
You know, maybe I won't miss you people as much as I thought.
Hmm. I can't help but think this selfish attitude is part of what got you here.
Oh, y-you better get rid of that before you get in there.
Hey, you guys take good care of my child rapist friend!
I wanted to tell you the good news in person.
Well, let's just say some new DNA evidence was produced.
Helping my son is the most Christian thing I could do.
Peter, I was at the park with Stewie, and someone stole his tricycle.
I was looking down at my phone and not at him.
It's got a vanity plate that won't even apply to him.
You like your reggae watered down and acceptable at a wedding?
I'll just have four to five beers to stop the shaking, and then I'll go outside.
You know anything about a tricycle that just got stolen from the park?
No, sir, I've been sitting here for the last three hours selling lemonade.
You couldn't have been here for three hours on this, the hottest day of the year, or the ice cubes in your pitcher would have melted.
Now I'm way into wooden beads you move along wires.
Boy, when you find a baby's tricycle, it feels like there's nothing you can't do.
Man, I wish we could quit our jobs and solve children's crimes full-time.
I'll give you 50 cents to find my lucky baseball card.
Oh, wait a minute, I didn't notice you have a pierced ear.
You go home and tell your mother she's supposed to be a parent, not a friend.
All right, guys, this'll be the headquarters for our new detective agency.
This milk crate will be my chair, this overturned rain barrel will be my desk, and this DNA evidence centrifuge and fingerprint scanner will be my coatrack.
I guess all our detective agency needs now is a name.
There's only one name that makes sense. Dicks for Kids? Dicks for Kids.
They're gonna think we're a bunch of old, bald geezers. Big Hairy Dicks for Kids.
So, you say this gumball machine took your dime and didn't give you a gumball?
You realize that kid is plowing both our wives right now.
Well, it seems like we got a bit of a crime spree.
Just this morning, we've had multiple reports of stolen items.
Uh, couple marbles, ball of yarn, two Wiffle ball bats.
Someday a rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets.
Guys, I think I've got a lead on all these thefts.
One of the kids had a nanny-cam hidden in his room.
Come on, let's do it on your son's tiny bed.
You think other guys hang out and watch their friend's naked gyrating butt?
It's been so long, I don't know what other friends do.
But I'm telling you, it's gonna be a bigger waste of time than writing tough-guy dialogue for a Jet Li movie.
Give me back my wife, or you're in a lot of trouble.
You're kind of undoing everything you just did when you kicked my ass.
Just a weird life-sized lady doll made out of all the stuff that got stolen.
Chris is still in his room with that disgusting homemade sex doll.
It's even weirder than that secret level in Donkey Kong.
Maybe it's our fault Chris has such a screwed-up idea about what a relationship is.
I mean, let's be honest, we're not exactly the model of a healthy marriage.
Oh, boy, is this 'cause of the time I pushed off of you after sex and bruised your boob?
No, I-I mean, when was the last time you bought me flowers, or-or we had a date night?
Just last week, I let you watch me complain after eating too many hot wings.
Okay, Peter, I got to take the kids to school now.
Hey, Chris, your mother wanted me to talk to you.
Um, she doesn't think it's healthy for you to be spending all your time with a homemade sex doll.
But I'm such a loser, she'll never let me do that.
You are every bit as good as that bag of garbage.
And look, if you really want to learn how to bang that thing, there's no better teacher than your old dad.
After all, I'm the guy who taught old Asian people how to get on the subway.
Now twirl that long hair sticking out of your face mole.
So we're gonna go inside and get some sexy shots of you doing fireman stuff.
The truth is, I don't care if we never take it to the next level, physically.
I'm gonna have to write to somebody about this. Dear Penthouse, I used to think these letters were fake until my taped-together, soccer-ball-headed girlfriend fell in my lap.
I think Heather will be eating breakfast standing up this morning, if you know what I mean.
Peter, I thought you were gonna take care of this.
You were supposed to make Chris get rid of that doll.
He slept with it, and now he'll slowly grow to hate it over the next 20 years.
God, you're more annoying than a creative voice mail message.
Listen, I can't decide what I want for breakfast tomorrow.
And you still haven't apologized for the way you treated me earlier.
Aw, come on, Lois. I'll make it up to you.
Oh, I thought it might have a funny riddle on it.
We're just cocooning today because Heather said she's never seen TV.
It's a Katherine Heigl mask for you to wear while we have sex.
She's perfect, because she's only sort of hot, so there won't be this crazy disconnect of her face on your body, which would totally take me out of it.
Also, it's designed so you can wear it on your butt.
And now I want to hear all about your day.
Hey, Lois, I heard Katherine Heigl likes to French kiss.
Chris treats that pile of junk better than Peter treats me!
What's the matter, Lois? Need to get in the mood?
Your father got a DVD of black people fighting in the street.
Oh. Well, tomorrow, Heather and I are going to the park to picnic and fly kites.
And on Saturday, she's hosting her book club, so I have to drop by, say something funny, and then stay upstairs.
Chris, when you go on your picnic tomorrow, c-can your father and I come with you?
What are you doing? You can't let him keep thinking that doll is real.
I know. But I just want Peter to see what a thoughtful man looks like for one afternoon.
People say we're different, but we're really not that different.
We both own cars, but we like to take the bus.
And we're both gonna have a moderate time at the party tonight.
Wow, it sure is fun going on a picnic, isn't it, Peter?
Yeah. Will you hold this beer bottle while I try to kick the top off it?
Your son's relationship with that doll is better than our own marriage!
Sometimes relationships run their course and come to a natural end.
This could be a sign that it's time to move on.
Aw, and I just helped him pick out that scarf.
Just like you got over your Hamster Dance Tourette Syndrome.
I don't know, but sometimes when life's got you down, you-you got to stand up for a second.
I can't deal with anything until I've had my after-nap coffee.
I don't think guys should have two hands on a coffee mug ever.
I see you turned your hat around so you can really get in there.
If it's the shot from Psycho where you can see
I took your doll because it's not a natural or healthy thing for a boy your age to have.
I was kind of jealous of it, so I guess I went a little crazy.
But I just want you to know, if you ever treat a real woman the way you treat that doll, you're gonna make her very happy.
You want to eat the baby together on the way home?
You know, Lois, I've been thinking about what you said.
And I did learn a little something from watching Chris and Heather.
From now on, I am gonna be treating you like garbage.
Okay, Chef Fudd, I was a little disappointed in you this week.
Your dish was just a live rabbit who thought he was taking a bath.
Yes. I saw he was scrubbing his back with a long celery stalk.
I'm happy to say your sufferin' succotash was absolutely delicious.
Oh, hey, Bri. Hey, you want to go out and get some gluten-free pizza?
Let's go to Whole Foods and buy a bunch of stuff from that weird aisle nobody else goes down.
Don't answer. It's just that Brian's been so distant lately, and we used to be inseparable-- like Jack and Jill.
Oh, so then Jack takes these two pails of water and trips and totally falls down the hill.
Jill had a tooth fall out, and she swallowed it, and then we had to root through her feces to find it.
And we did. And then we took it to the dentist, and he put it back in her mouth.
Some sad news this morning as 38 schoolchildren drowned when their-- excuse me-- when their school bus hit a patch of ice and drove off a loc-- what is wrong with me today?-- and drove off a local bridge.
And now the viral video of the week, with over seven million views.
For those of you who loved Screaming Sheep, we've got Opera Penguin.
All right, well, a U.S. convoy was ambushed in Kabul this morning, so now we're going to have a moment of silence in remembrance...
What is a penguin? Is it some kind of bug?
Oh, wait, I don't know if you're gonna be in it, Joe.
I thought, while we filmed, we'd just keep all of our stuff on your lap.
I saw a scary boy doing this, and I thought I'd try it.
But I thought you and I could hang out and maybe watch Lois shush Peter while they watch Nashville.
Wait a minute-- Joe and Bonnie never used to spend time together until they had Susie.
That's it, Rupert! That's how Brian and I are going to improve our relationship.
I say, this is my best idea since I robbed a Joseph A. Bank.
I'm gonna lay it all out for Brian why we should have a baby together.
I'm terrific. And that is so sweet of you to ask.
It'll just take a second. I-I normally wouldn't do this, but I was already kind of in the middle of something, and I just need to quickly respond, and there I am finiiished.
If we're going to fix this relationship, we need a baby and we need it now.
I'm just going to take a little bit of his DNA, and soon we'll be proud parents, like Ron Livingston's parents.
Oh, um... he's, uh... he was, like, the main guy in Office Space.
Uh, he was in, like, at least five Sex in the Citys.
Okay, let's see. Now, what are the ingredients to a viral Internet video?
Th-This is, like, the worst time to ask for a soda.
You know what, we should just go out and start filming.
I'm moving through the scene and I slam the door.
Oh, no! I slammed it too hard, and the house is gonna squash me!
This will impregnate me with the child that will bring Brian and me back together!
First, I add Brian's hair and saliva, and some preschool applications, because we are already way behind.
There. Now I just have to get into the machine, and then the machine does whatever it has to do to me in order to successfully impregnate me.
We do not judge the machine. We do not judge Stewie.
Oh, my God! And in 18 years, he's going to move away!
Simple. I took your DNA and inserted it into my temporary uterus through my fertilization device.
People are gonna think I had sex with a male baby and then got him pregnant!
Oh, thank you for finding a way to make it sound horrible.
Is this about money? Because I have a bit saved.
Stewie, you have to get rid of it. Get rid of it? You know, why don't you just say it?
You need to get a big fat abortion right this second!
I mean, you have all these amazing qualities, and I'm kind of good-looking.
Why not? Why am I always apologizing for how good-looking I am? I'm sick of it.
I can model in Paris. We could take the baby with us.
We could be that kind of family. What do you think?
If you ever lay a finger on me again, I'll burn you in your bed.
I got a viral Internet video that's gonna go straight to the top of the charts.
Hi, I'm Joe Swanson, and this is 30 impressions in 30 seconds. Show me the money. Oh, behave. Good morning, Vietnam. Wait until they get a load of me, said the Joker.
Hey, I need you to take me to the doctor for my prenatal vitamins.
I'm not really sure. Two days, six months... there's a certain amount of guesswork involved in this.
Oh, and while I'm pregnant, I'm going to need you to change the cat litter. We don't have a cat.
Not too ridiculous for you to put a baby in me.
Now, before we begin, I want you to know the record is just past my watch.
Your vagina seems to have a penis and two testicles.
Oh, right. I, uh... sneezed real hard and all that came out.
Could you do that thing where you take some fluid and tell me if it's going to be an imbecile or a cretin?
Oh, not to worry, there are places where those people can be warehoused.
Now, Brian, did you have any questions for the doctor?
Yeah. Are there a lot of stairs in this building?
Look at how tiny all these clothes are. It's so adorable.
I mean, what kind of feet can fit into these shoes?
Let me ask you, are you leaking? Because I've been leaking.
How old are you? You look like you're 40, which means whatever you've got in there is 100% brain-damaged.
They're getting really large, and I'm not sure if I'm completely covering them.
Dad, can I get one of your head on the belly?
It's another way of sayin' how much I love you
Okay, now people really love that viral video of a monkey forcin' that sex act on a frog at the zoo.
So maybe we can find another frog for somethin' like that.
That frog in the miniskirt putting a quarter in the jukebox.
I'm concerned that frog's in more trouble than she realizes.
Isn't that weird? Yes, Stewie, that's the one weird thing in all this.
Brian, I need you to take me to the hospital.
It's a divorced woman who knows about lady parts and cheers you on. Let's go!
Brian, I'm going to need you to deliver the baby.
Uh, uh, o-okay, c-can you wait a second while I put a towel down?
Our first priority should be to keep the vinyl clean.
Well, maybe you should look at the part of me where there's a baby coming out!
Well, whatever comes out, save it. I want to eat it.
I just put Jack and Rose down for their nap.
And I'm trying to keep the more attractive ones in this area.
Oh, I caught two of them trying to eat each other, so that's something we need to watch out for.
You know, I was actually thinking, this could be a chance for you to finally make things right.
Well, you do have a son that you were never there for.
All right, let's check our YouTube channel and see how we're doing.
Geez, that word looks even harsher when it's in all caps.
Wow, people really seem to hate everything we put on here.
That sucks. And I worked really hard on taking a picture of myself every day for a year and then setting the photos to an emotional song.
Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
Great, because dog-head/human-ears over here doesn't react to anything I say.
We are going to be spending a fortune on schools.
How are we gonna pay for that? Well, you tell me.
You're the one who insisted I be a stay-at-home mom.
I just feel like once I get them on a schedule, everything will be fine.
I can't believe we couldn't come up with a viral video.
We should've just gotten Jimmy Fallon to do any lame thing.
But first, this week's viral video, Fat Kid Hustles Through Crosswalk.
Here it is. Here's little Chubbo pulling up the rear.
That's right. Don't let your chocolate levels get too low.
I can't believe Chris gets four million hits just crossing the street.
I don't know. Lois is in charge of the kids.
I don't know why anyone would want to be a parent, especially to four children.
I-I j... I just got to get away for a couple weeks.
The whole point of this was for us to spend more time together.
Wait, what are you talking about? The whole point of what?
I thought if we had a baby it would bring us closer together.
What? I was only distant because you've been so moody lately.
Well, I was only moody because you were so distant!
I'm still keeping all the gifts from the baby shower.
Hey! Are you a big, fat bastard who loves eating at Outback Steakhouse, but thinks the portions are too small?
We don't have a Bloomin' Onion, we have a Bloomin' Pumpkin!
And why don't you wash it down with 40 ounces of malt liquor and ranch dressing, you fat!
The best thing about going there is you get to fly over the Pacific Ocean.
Everyone knows that, pound for pound, the Atlantic is the best ocean. Pound for pound?
What are you talking about? You can't weigh the ocean.
All anybody remembers about your argument is that you're in a wheelchair!
Let's stop escalatin' and take the stairs for a minute.
Isn't this a beautiful planet you two friends live on?
It kind of got twisted up in our scuffle there.
You calmed them down just by talking with your mouth and your pretty lips.
Just a little something I learned volunteering as a youth counselor down at my church.
Pretty much just boils down to four or five catchphrases.
There's What do you think it means? Pray on it, stay on it.
Hey, you're way too good to be doing that for free.
You know, finally start chipping away at some of that horrendous debt you've got.
I mean, it's not like you've found a job since you moved back here anyway.
That's how I can always tell which guys in the Wrangler Jeans commercials beat their wives.
Oh, I'm selling my old Beanie Babies to make money for the prom.
I could try to get you a job at the airport.
Mayor West, after working with you for some time now,
You are doing deliberately odd things to mask dark, maybe even criminal, activities.
I strive for these things, and I get them, but at the end of the day, I still don't feel fulfilled.
Maybe your accomplishments don't feel real because your brother isn't here to see them.
She didn't say good morning to me, so I put an orange dot on her boarding pass, which means they're going to search her anus.
I noticed you also circled a bunch of things on her ticket.
You see, the whole thing we're going for here at the TSA is a sort of bored fascism.
The worst thing a passenger can do is approach your podium before you tell them to.
As bad as those the people we see here every day are much worse.
Now that you mention it, everybody does look kind of dumpy.
They're all told to wear a pair of their dads' pants.
Oh, speaking of which, tomorrow, bring in a pair of your dad's pants.
Well, I was doing the dishes for a while, but they were inexperienced, so I ended up having to rub one out.
Where in the hell did you get the idea that that's what I meant by doing the dishes?
Why would I talk to Cleveland? He's a therapist now, and he's really great at helping people with their problems.
You want me to tell your best friend my complaints about you so he can back you up.
Look, you're the one who said you were going crazy.
And the nurse told me there's blood in my stool.
Put this man down for a pair of lesbian shoes.
Let's have this man intubated and fit with a pair of lesbian shoes.
I'm sorry, I'm tryin' to read the Costco Connection here.
All right, since you're a patient, we're gonna talk about you like you're not here.
Oh, I think we got to the root of the problem.
All I do is sit in the bathroom and play on my phone.
Cleveland helped me see that our entire relationship has been you doing whatever you want and me cleaning up the mess.
By the way, your Svengali is out there spraying birds with a hose.
Cleveland and I think we need to make some changes.
You're gonna start helping around the house, and we're gonna start doing things together.
I made you keep track of all the words I know. Shoehorn.orn. Engine. Football.
Yeah, her breasts and her stomach are different parts of her body!
Whoa, sorry, ma'am, we can't let you through security because you're da bomb.
Well, I am carrying more than three ounces of liquid.
Well, you put the wet clothes in the dryer, you close the door and you wait.
So you... you just stand here and watch the whole time?
If it goes around 30 times in five minutes, you get to have a Diet Coke!
All right, according to Cleveland, it's also healthy for couples to have shared activities.
So-so what do I do, just aim for the pond?
No, you're not supposed to hit it into the water.
Why do they even have water if you're not supposed to hit it there?
Well, I'm doing security at the roller rink if you want to come watch me. Sure!
Time to make marks on pieces of paper no one will ever see again.
He's got Lois making me help around the house and spend more time with her.
He said I've gotta be more open and receptive to what Bonnie wants to do in the bedroom.
Well, remember how Cleveland banged that stripper at his bachelor party?
Or... remember when Cleveland wore briefs under his boxers and we found out and he told us not to say anything?
Cleveland, it ain't cool what you've been telling Lois. All right?
And you gotta tell her you were wrong and put things back the way they were.
I'm sorry it's hard for you, Peter, but personal growth isn't always easy.
Look, if you don't change what you're saying, we're gonna tell Donna you slept with that stripper at your bachelor party.
I'm gonna play Locomotive Breath by Jethro Tull while he runs.
Why the hell would you do something stupid like that?
We now return to Major League Baseball with one distractingly ugly guy behind home plate.
It's two to two in the bottom of the sixth, and I just can't get my eyes off that man with the tall head.
It's quite a game, but man, that guy is ugly.
But you know, that guy hasn't blinked this entire game.
Yup. And the longer I watch him, the more I wonder if he's there by himself.
I'm gonna see if I can hit him with my apple.
Cleveland didn't show up to my therapy session earlier, and Donna says she hasn't seen him for two days.
She also weirdly told me that she squatted 250 today.
Well, I am off to try and get out of this conversation.
He was slightly inconveniencing me and Joe, so we threatened to destroy his family.
Whatever the hell you did, you go find him and bring him back!
You're makin' me feel lower than a squid at the bottom of the ocean.
Listen up, Meg: this TSA isn't sweaty enough for the two of us.
Okay, hold on, let me do a small dippy-bob turn.
I couldn't be sure, but I-I think the man has a knife!
Are there any steps leading to that alley or is it just a series of gentle ramps?
And since he eats, like, nine candy bars a day, if we wait here at the convenience store, he's bound to show up.
Mr. Griffin, did you or did you not distribute alcohol and marijuana to minors?
Yeah. I was thinking maybe our best bet is to just drive around town and see if we can spot him.
I-I thought we were gonna meet at the Tumi store and see who buys luggage at the airport.
Oh, my God! The ones we have a zillion of but are somehow never there when people need them?
That's right, and I'm going to have to check your locker.
I don't need to tell you how serious this is.
And with people like you stealing tubs, how are we ever going to catch Abu Nazir?
I'll miss the way you reminded people about their belts.
Guys, I think we need to embrace the possibility that Cleveland never existed.
Dammit, if only there was some kind of clue as to where he might be.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry we threatened to blab about your bachelor party stripper stuff.
'Cause that'd mean I'd have to talk to Donna, and that's... that's just, like, ugh.
And I'm sorry I caused such problems in your marriage.
I've been back almost a year and I still got nothing going on.
All right, come on, buddy. Let's get out of here.
And, you know, even though therapy might not be your thing, you've got a job.
Peter, thanks for going to find Cleveland and bringing him home safely.
Hey, what about you, Meg? What'd you do this week?
No, Meg. I'm your father, and I'm interested in what my daughter did this week.
But I-I feel like you're drawing this out, so when you do make fun of me, it'll hurt more.
I'm asking you, please-- and-and you don't have to tell me,
I want to know because I'm interested-- what you did this week.
It enhances my life to know how yours is going.
Then by all means. I-- It's just upsetting when you thumb your nose at the family.
But I love you, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to say.
I was just thinking about pudding on the way over here.
Okay, well, you two are clearly in love, but I could also go for some pudding.
It's got to be that new billboard advertising pudding on the highway.
Everyone in my house can get very excited by a good ad campaign.
It's that one that says CBS Outdoor Advertising on it.
Yeah, but right above that is, like, a big guy eating pudding.
I just remember CBS Outdoor Advertising on the bottom and three pigeons sitting on top.
Ordinarily I'd say no, but that adult kickball league is coming in for drinks, so let's get out of here.
Do you have any idea how crippled you sound right now?
God, sometimes I just want to shake some sense into you.
Big talk for a guy who looks like a dad at a Dave Matthews' concert.
I am climbing that billboard to prove it's real pudding.
All right, there's no pudding, but there is a kid up here.
Peter, stay put. I'll call this in, and we'll get a crew out here to help you both down.
No, no, no, nobody would kill a bunch of babies for maracas.
You could kill, like, eight at a time that way.
Plus, it softens them up, so you can get the bones right out.
Peter Griffin, in recognition of your heroism in helping to rescue little Mikey Nicholson,
I'd like to present you with this key to the city.
Now don't forget to water the plants every other day and change the cat's litter.
You know, some of you out there are calling me a hero.
Those of you from Connecticut are calling me a grinder.
I'm not just pieces of meat between pieces of bread.
I know you mean the opposite of what you're saying.
Fact is, when I saved that boy, I wasn't thinking.
I wanted to see if a billboard had real pudding in it, so I climbed up there and came out a hero.
It's just like Gandhi always said, eat as much as you want and do whatever, and don't be afraid to hit each other.
Peter, that thing you said about not thinking and just doing stuff, did you mean that?
I just want to confirm that you understand that this is Joe.
Joe, what are you doing? You can't quit your job.
Wow. I can't remember the last time Joe shot his gun.
I know. That bullet's been rolling around in his junk drawer for years.
I guess I'll just have to find out when I land.
You know, not only did he quit his job, he's moved out and gotten his own apartment.
Maybe next time go straight to a medical professional and skip the horses and illiterate servants.
Well, that is the last time I drink and masturbate on top of a high wall.
I'm talking like this because I'm being very careful not to upset you, and for some reason this is the voice people use to do that.
It's the gun that no-leg sprinter used to kill his girlfriend.
Eh, anyone who's kind of fast gets a free pass from me.
The kind of guy who's always got butterscotch candies for his friends.
I got to be honest, Joe, we came over here because we were worried about you, but these candies tell me you're doing great.
Well, it seems like you made the right choice, Joe.
I mean, I ain't seen anyone this happy since the invention of the penny-farthing bicycle.
I expressly said no rakes allowed on the street when I am riding my futuristic machine.
I love being super pumped for 15 minutes and then bored out of my mind for eight hours.
It's great to just stand there and let Mother Nature spray it all over your face.
Donna's big fat aunt is in town, so I can definitely go.
Man, I am filling these Gatorade bottles as fast as I'm drinking them.
This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
I want to kiss that cow, but I don't want it to be my idea.
Oh, I see three young men who could use the tickle monster.
I stopped listening to him back at the drive-thru when he leaned out the window and ordered a fur burger.
Wow. You know, when you see it up close, it really is incredible.
In the future, I believe there will be water wars.
You know, Lois always dreamed about coming here, and now I know why.
It's so weird that he argued over the price of breakfast this morning.
I guess it reminded me of all the things I can't do.
But somehow, as soon as I decided to kill myself,
The whole point of bringing us to Niagara Falls was just to kill yourself?
I just wanted to spend my last week with my best pals.
Well, not for nothing, but you could've taken us all to Disney World and shot yourself in the room.
Yeah, he's not handsome, but I will say this, he keeps a good lawn.
Yeah, some might say the second best lawn in the neighborhood.
Yeah, then you'd be the tenth friend who's killed himself in front of me.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... those two girls and...
Look, you guys, what we really need to do is bring him back to Quahog where we can get him some help.
It's too bad we already bought those tickets for the Whirlpool Aero Car.
Okay, we'll do the Whirlpool Aero Car, and then take Joe back to Quahog.
Okay, okay, Whirlpool Aero Car, then White Water Walk, then we bring Joe back.
Well, you can't do Niagara Falls without riding the Maid of the Mist.
And, guys, remember, the pool towels go home with us.
Well, this has just been one heck of a fun day.
Yeah. Yeah, you know, seeing the natural beauty of this place is actually making me feel much better.
I don't know why he wanted this, but we're honoring your father's wishes.
You know, I spent the whole time trying to kill myself, but it took seeing you guys almost die to realize that life really is worth living.
And we wouldn't trade you for any friend in the world.
All right, okay, don't anyone sing anything else until we get home. We got to record this.
Well, that was kind of a weird trip, but I'm glad we went.
I was the only black man ever to go there.
Turns out not many people want to probably get shot for $24,000 a year.
I hired some guys to come to the house on Tuesday and assault her, and I'll come in and save her, and she'll be so grateful, she'll have to take me back.
Unbelievable! Brian throws up once, and you rush him to the vet.
I-I got more energy than a cruise ship conga line.
Brian, your blood work shows that your liver isn't functioning properly.
Well, I don't know if I'd label myself a drinker.
I know I like a cold beer after I mow the lawn.
Now, the most obvious step would simply be to stop drinking.
Well, we do have these pills that may correct the enzyme imbalance in your liver. Yeah, that one.
Okay, I'll be in the waiting room barking at the fish in the tank.
All right, Mr. Griffin, these pills will clear up Brian's condition.
It means they have to be inserted into the patient's anus.
Now, you'll need to administer these pills, because no dog ever voluntarily takes a suppository.
His bum looks like that guy with a hundred cigarettes in his mouth.
Hey, can you check my back for kick me signs?
Don't want anyone to get freaked out by the transformation.
I got to say, it feels kind of weird having someone join me for lunch.
Well, time to break out my terrible Jewish bag lunch.
Let's see. Smoked whitefish, herring in cream sauce, smoked sable-- that's a different kind of whitefish-- and for dessert, the only bad cookie in the world.
It's good. I know everyone back there, so they let me drink their corn water.
Boy, it's so great having someone I can talk to.
I think you and I could get along very nicely.
Yeah. We'll be a better team than the Warsaw Globetrotters.
All right, Brian, it's time for you to take one of these pills from the vet.
Oh, yeah, right. Can we do what we normally do, where you roll it up in a piece of cheese like you're fooling me? Yeah, I guess, but then you're gonna have cheese in your ass.
I got to give you these pills the butt way.
No, no, no. I do not go the butt way.
Look, I know it sounds a little rough, but why don't we start with a gentle massage of the area and see how you feel?
Huh. Guess I'm just gonna have to take him by surprise.
I should probably watch that old episode of Lassie where Timmy has to give her a suppository.
So from now on, anytime you got to cut one, you pull your pants down and you do it through this fart hole.
As soon as Brian does it, I'm gonna be on the other side, and I'll stick the suppository in.
You think Morgan Fairchild has a fart hole in her house?
Well, thank you. Yes, it is my liver, and I don't want to take that pill.
It's nice to watch TV when you have nothing else to do, isn't it?
I'm still in charge of you! Stop it! Get away from me!
This is for your benefit, so just go limp and take it!
You touch my ass, I swear to God I'll kill you!
You're damn right I did! And I'll do it again if you don't stay the hell away from my ass!
I don't know, dear. By the way, we're the couple who lives a few blocks away.
We now return to an '80s teen movie at a realistic high school.
So, Peter, I assume if you're watching TV, that means you already did all my chores?
I scared off the mailman, threatened Quagmire's cat, and I even took your bath for you.
All right, I need you to buy a birthday present for my friend Jeff-- he likes the Packers and surfing.
First thing tomorrow, I'm taking Brian to obedience school so we can get him back under control.
You know, sending him to school wouldn't be the worst idea.
He might even enjoy it. I know I had a blast in college.
Man, I love college. So many chicks, so many parties.
I'm supposed to meet the R.A. for coffee later in the common room, but until then,
I'm just gonna walk around with my shower caddy and see what people wrote on their whiteboards.
Uh, before I touch anything, is this a nut-free counter?
I don't know-- my dad's might have been on there this morning.
I saw you stomp that pigeon today with your bare foot.
Thanks. I don't like losing any part of my lunch.
Look, I'd love to stay and talk, Neil, but I have homework, and there was no toilet paper in the girls' bathroom.
Well, while you freshen up, maybe I could help you get a head start on that homework.
Wait, Neil, I thought you and I were gonna go find unlocked cars and pretend we're driving them.
Well, I guess I have to do it by myself.
Or maybe you're that comedy dog with Robert Smigel's hand up your backside.
All right, first of all, it seems like you have a lot of opinions about a lot of comedians.
Now, down on all fours like the rest of them!
In fact, you seem like a prime candidate for The Chair.
Listen, Meg, would you want to go to a movie sometime?
You sure are spending a lot of time with my sister lately.
And I'd also think you're putting the moves on Meg.
Listen, Chris, you're my friend, so I have to confess.
My sitting with you at lunch was part of a carefully laid-out plan to get close to your sister.
We even got Sean Penn to dress up as my dad.
Go away! I never want to talk to you again!
I feel more betrayed than when I thought that lawyer was gonna propose.
Motion to have the last eight years stricken from the record!
Sir, if it takes the rest of my life, I will repay you.
Brian, what did they do to you at that school?
Yes, looks like someone's gone at him with a hwhip.
That is... that is a perfectly valid way of saying that.
Permission to take fast, tiny bites of my own tail, sir?
I just want to piss a couple of guys off.
It's actually the first time I've been on a date since I got the nickname Gutterball.
You used me just so you could date my sister!
Boy, Peter, seems like that obedience school did wonders for Brian.
Hey, Brian, you know... you know what we should do?
That-that... that'd be peeing in the house, and that's-that's... that's bad dog stuff.
Forgive me for speaking out of turn, sir, but you sent me to that school to change me.
I've got to go make the waffle fries that you scream-requested in the car.
We used to be so close, but now we seem so different.
A record crowd of 65 people turned out for Free Jerky Stick Night.
Traffic on 146 is backed up all the way to Mineral Spring Avenue...
I don't own any cassettes, so I just have to play whatever's on the radio.
Look, Chris, I-I'm sorry I lied to you, but I'd still like to be friends, and I hope...
I'm sorry. I have to put the boom box down.
I finally give you a shot, and you abandon me in a movie theater?!
I'm sorry, Meg, but my friendship with Chris is more important.
Hey, Lois, you noticed ever since Brian came back from obedience school that things have been weird?
Well, he just lets me order him around, and he-he never wants to do fun stuff together like before.
I mean, the thing I always loved about Brian was that he wasn't just a pet.
I think we just have to accept that this is how he is now.
I'm sorry, Brian, but I'm doing this in the name of friendship.
That's the appropriate response if anyone gets near your anus.
I know, but that's what I liked about you, you know?
You were fun, we got into trouble together, we got...
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. I just rubbed my eye with this finger.
Am I gonna be okay? Am I gonna be okay?
Peter, I want things back the way they were, too.
And now I'm gonna go upstairs and pee in Meg's bed.
Hey! You requesting a song or ordering some sliced meat?
You mean like a slice of turkey, or like a short section of one musical recording that's been digitally repurposed to be part of a new song?
In honor of Sammy, on the bus ride over here, we all sat in the back.
Lucille Ball was back there with us, and I saw her smoking a Cuban.
Peter, it's not a wedding, it's an infomercial for The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts.
All right, so I guess I am the tallest one of us.
That's right, I want to be the man of the hour.
And I want all my pals to give me a good ribbing.
Geez, Peter, you're more excited than Adrian Peterson at an arboretum.
Man, I want to beat you with so many things around here.
Ladies and gentlemen and people who have wandered in from the Chinese wedding next door, welcome to the roast of Peter Griffin, with your roast master Glenn Quagmire.
Joe, I'd tell you to take your seat, but I'd be about 15 years too late.
Well, what can I say about the man of the hour, Peter Griffin?
In high school, he didn't play sports, but he did wear a helmet.
You know, Peter, I love your chin, but I got to ask.
What's it like going through life with a scrotum so close to your mouth?
You know, Peter's challenging the stereotype of Irish guys being fat, drunk and stupid by throwing a little gay in there, too.
But I got to say, the worst part of being Peter's friend is knowing that eventually you're gonna have to be the fat-ass's pallbearer.
But seriously, everyone, let's have a big round of applause for the real hero tonight: Peter's chair.
Peter's got a small penis, but, hey, nothing grows in the shade.
This just in... is what Peter had to say to his wife on their wedding night, so she knew it was actually happening.
Peter's so ugly, he couldn't get raped in our holding cell down at the station.
For those of you who don't know, we have a real serious problem with people getting raped in our holding cell down at the station.
Peter, you're loud, you can't hold down a job, and you got high blood pressure.
You could be a black guy if your ding-a-ling wasn't so damn tiny.
I hate the thought of her having sex with Peter.
Peter's so fat and stupid, Lamar Odom tried to bang him.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, now that we've had our fun, it's time to give our man of the hour a chance to have his say.
Just tell us what color it was and be done with it.
On account of my buddies all being nasty sons of bitches,
Yeah, but I thought they'd stick to material about how I'm too handsome to work at a brewery, or-or how I have tiny little baby sneezes.
Yeah, it was supposed to be fun, but it was humiliating.
I just think you're a really cool island, and I'd like to get to know...
Maybe I got to find friends who can't make fun of my appearance
Like those two bearded dwarves walking across the street there.
I never thought of my kids' principal as being a friend.
Hey, it's cool you got the keys to the school, and we can hang out when no one else is here.
Wow, I've never drank so much milk in my life.
Maybe I'm just not meant to find a new group of friends.
Well, Peter, you're always welcome to hang out with me.
Yeah, but I'm talking about the kind of friend that doesn't bark at horses when I'm watching a movie.
Fine, fine, you want to get trampled in your living room?
I don't know, I-I don't seem to fit in anywhere.
All right, I'm gonna go get some more coffee and maybe a gross microwaved sandwich.
We were just debating if Jamie should hook up with this guy she met a few nights ago.
Wow, you know, I know I just met you guys, but I've kind of been looking for a new group of friends.
Are you good at talking about how busy you are?
Ugh, yeah, but don't talk to me about anything until I've had my morning coffee,
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd love to have you in our group of girlfriends.
Hey, can I be the one who laugh-screams really loud at restaurants?
Like a panda bear on a bed full of pillows.
Hey, isn't it funny that you guys came over for a dinner party, and all we're doing is standing in the kitchen, drinking wine?
All our toothbrushes were in that one woman's glass this morning.
Girls, it is so nice to be part of a group again.
Yeah, and then I realized I'm not good at making fettuccine Alfredo, but I am good at making reservations.
Karen's the one with the mommy blog, so if you think you know her from somewhere, that's where.
Oh, no, I don't want to get in the way.
Besides, I got to get this little man in the tub.
For a second, I thought she was gonna come with us.
Hey, if you think that's funny, she once had a miscarriage outside a Petco.
Why did he have to go around telling strangers what to do?
Lois tried to give CPR to a kid at a wedding once, and when she knelt down, she accidentally high-heeled her own stink hole.
Oh, hang on, guys, I got to talk to my dog.
Yesterday, Karen laughed so hard she popped a button on her jeans.
You should be defending her, not talking trash and gossiping behind her back like some kind of Midwestern teenager.
She let Alan Ackerman smack her in the back with his tallywhacker behind the snack shack.
What? Nobody here in Maryland understands a single word you're saying.
I Snapchatted Matt Gackerack a Kodak of my ass crack!
I did something bad I need to tell you about.
You used some of my magazines for your fake ransom notes.
But did you put the ice cream where the guy said?
Look, the thing is, me and my new girlfriends, we've kind of been talking trash about you and laughing behind your back.
Peter, of course your new friends have been talking crap about me.
Well, I'm not thrilled, but I understand what it's like to be friends with women.
I'm sure they talk trash about you behind your back.
I guarantee you that as soon as you leave the room, they tear you to shreds.
Just like I figured out who was stealing my lunch at work.
Next time there's a sandwich in the fridge with somebody's name on it, don't eat it, scumbag!
That lunch didn't have your name on it, but this bullet does.
Ugh, have you guys seen the new Jessica Biel movie?
Um, I'm maybe gonna go use the restroom and let you guys talk about whatever you're gonna talk about.
These aren't drugstore glasses, they came from a doctor Halloween costume.
Hey, man, just a heads-up: instead of howling at the moon tonight, we're all gonna yell cock-a-doodle-doo!
I'm just trying to make sure you don't look silly.
I'd been mulling over for years, and when Family Guy gave me the opportunity to shoot it,
I knew there was only one actor who could portray Phil the Wolf: Glenn Quagmire.
Peter gave me a beer that tasted funny, and when I woke up,
I don't even remember, there was such a long cutaway, but I know it was really mean.
Being friends with women is way more complex than that.
You and I will get revenge on those bitches lady-style.
Wait, i-is that the same Number Six that had sex with Dr. Baltar?
I don't... I've been... I've been watching this the same exact amount of time you have, Lois.
Ooh, what does that green button on the far panel do?
Way ahead of you, Lois. I just cut her brakes.
Hey, you're the one who said we should try to ruin her marriage.
She bangs up her car, her husband's gonna be furious.
The whole family's dream is that she gets a spot on the U.S. Olympic Team.
Okay, so get a lead pipe and bust this girl's kneecaps.
Now, she's been planning her daughter's wedding for a year.
Being friends with women is way too complicated and way too intense for me.
Now let me just pay the busboy and we can get out of here.
Look, I-I'm real sorry I got so worked up at my roast.
Because men might punch you in the gut and call you a fat idiot, but at least they do it to your face and own it.
And that is why chest hair is on its way... back.
Hey, guys. I got something for you, an invitation for each of you to Quagfest.
Quagfest? What's that? You and a guest are cordially invited to witness Glenn Quagmire's at Quagfest, a three-day festival celebrating the three F's: food, fun, and...
It's gonna be like a block party but with way more weirdos grinding up against your wives.
There hasn't been that kind of excitement on our street since we had that big Dumpster in our front yard.
Hollywood comes to Quahog, almost, as three hours from here in Waterbury, Connecticut,
His new project is reportedly an historical epic, in which Mr. Neeson stars as a vengeance-crazed Albert Einstein.
Channel Five News has this exclusive first look that I taped off my VCR from Entertainment Tonight.
What? He's a fake tough guy. I could totally kick his ass.
Knock it off. We've had to hear this same speech a million times.
Yeah, every time you get a couple of beers in you, we have to hear all about how you can beat up Liam Neeson.
What about that time we snuck beers into the opera?
Hey, you know this old woman who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn't know what to do?
I noticed that you're one of the moms who hasn't yet signed up to be a classroom volunteer.
Oh, I-I just assumed after that incident in the parking lot with that bitch in the Lexus, you wouldn't want me to.
But, yeah, I'd be happy to help out in the class.
What? I don't want you here. This is my turf.
I don't bother you when you're sitting on the washing machine, screaming Aaron Eckhart's name.
Great! We'd love to have you start tomorrow, if you're free.
Hmm, I guess I could just get the mail at night.
Oh, look, here's a simulation of what it's like to have sex with Quagmire.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to Quagfest.
Now, no celebration of my 1,000th would be complete without first meeting number one.
Here she is, all the way from Weathersfield Elementary School,
Ladies and gentlemen, my 1,000th sexual conquest is... this largemouth bass!
I thought I was here to watch normal intercourse on a residential street.
Oh, this'll be so fun volunteering in your class, Stewie.
Aw, did you spill juice on yourself, sweetheart? Sweetheart? Slow your roll there, Cougar Town.
Well, let's get you cleaned up. And you know what?
What the hell?! If anyone should be her helper, it should be me.
Yeah, except I got molested in the House of Mirrors by either one man or 100 identical men.
Yeah, I'll tell you who might want a heads-up: Liam Neeson.
I mean, we just had a great day of fun and rides and finger-sniffing, and all you can talk about is fighting some guy you've never even met!
I'd knock his teeth down his throat and out his stupid Irish fudge knot.
If you were ever face-to-face with Liam Neeson, you'd crap your pants.
To meet Loretta at a McDonald's parking lot to pick up my son, Cleveland, Jr.
I cried in my sedan, in front of my boy.
I'm sorry. Can we do a happy yell again to get the taste out of my mouth? All right!
All right, Peter, Liam Neeson must be on the other side of that barrier.
We just got to get you on that set, so you can kick his ass.
Hello, sir. We're here to see Liam Neeson, the guy who wears the same long jacket in all his movies.
Peter, you're never gonna get close enough to Liam Neeson to throw a punch at the guy.
That's why I got to lure him out here to come to me.
That's why I'm dressing up as the one woman no Irishman can resist: Mrs. Potato Head.
Any Irish actors around who might be interested in me?
Okay, guys, there's no better way to draw out an Irishman than setting up a confession booth.
The best way to kill wolves is to kill their leader, wear his skin, kiss some of the wolves, then kill them.
Sometimes I roll up those tattoo magazines, stuff 'em up my sleeve.
If I get caught, I just tell the man I forgot.
Excuse me, sir. We were sent here by the production.
Are you the guy who's been looking for Liam Neeson?
I am. Do you mind if we ask what for?
We'll raise your bail money as soon as we can!
Do you mind if I follow you home and use yours?
Miss Tammy's in her car yelling at her boyfriend on the phone again, so it looks like I'm doing lunch.
Okay, Landon, time to sabotage you with the most dangerous thing in the world for a toddler: a whole, uncut grape.
Did your mommy forget to slice your grapes for you?
If you're gonna seduce my mother, then I shall seduce yours.
I'll be as irresistible to her as wood is to a woodchuck.
Mom, Dad, I've done a lot of thinking, and I've decided I don't want to go into the family business.
How much disease could a woodchuck doctor cure if a woodchuck doctor could cure disease?
Next time, if you have an idea, run it through the test before you embarrass yourself.
Oh, sorry. I thought you were gonna ask something else.
That's right. I hear you've been all over town saying you could kick my arse.
May I offer you the most sincere, honest apology I...?
Will Stewie stop being jealous of his mom or something?
Stay tuned for the thrilling conclusion of this story, and the just-regular conclusion of the other story.
I was just trying to seem tough in front of my friends!
I've been a world-famous tough guy since I was 55.
The Internet tells me that's something you might have a need for.
Hmm... well, that could save me some time in the morning.
Whatever it takes for you to not beat me up.
But one slip-up, and you'll be deader than the first man to die in the Battle of the Boyne.
All right, Landon, let's see how you like it when someone moves in on your territory.
Let's just say your mom's about to see a diaper rashy scrotum.
Oh, I certainly hope no one sees Landon's mom bobbing for Stew.
Um, first, I've been summoned to be a potential juror, but I don't want to go, so I need you to report in my name.
Um, I would try to be fair, but, uh, I am on record, you know, very famously, as having released a kraken.
Your Honor, we'd like to thank and excuse juror number 17.
I want you to take over my Twitter feed and tweet back to my fans.
You get the gist of what my Twitter is about.
Peter, I was at an outdoor mall today, and there was a kiosk selling little remote control cars.
It was very funny and enjoyable, so what I need you to do is to go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
Go to the gym, kneel down in the shower, and ask strange men to pee in your cupped hands.
All right, guys, how are we doing on Peter's bail money?
Oh, Bonnie won't let me spend any more money on Peter because he's not very nice to me.
So, you ready to admit you're never gonna kick Liam Neeson's ass?
If you beat up Liam Neeson, how come it wasn't in the papers?
Just don't do it in front of me, all right?
And besides, my week as a helper mommy is done now, so when you come home today, you'll have me all to yourself.
So, you know, Jar Jar wasn't there the whole time.
I don't like to do it a lot, but you're my friend, Peter.
I acted like such a big man, and I didn't want to admit I was a coward.
Now, Peter, I'm out of crackers, and I'm gluten-free, so what I need you to do is go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
Your story thread in Love, Actually is the second worst.
No way your son would learn the drums in that amount of time.
I was stupid to think I could beat up Liam Neeson.
Are you kidding? You took on the star of Kinsey!
Yeah, and more importantly, you followed through on your drunken ravings.
Randy Jackson was just a big sea turtle in human clothes, we heard.
No, we all just booked a vacation together to a private resort in the Bahamas.
Well, that's a lot of my money, but I used to have sex with you, so that's the trade-off.
We found a great group rate on a discount Web site.
I can't wait to get down there and dip my fingers in the water.
Yeah, it'll be awesome to nail a hotel masseuse and then watch Nanny McPhee in the room.
I'll just walk around my yard naked, pee anywhere I want.
I think it's great that Peter and Lois are getting away together.
Yeah, I think Dad's actually kind of excited about it.
Yes, very. He even bought some sort of language tapes, although I don't think he's using them properly.
I shoved an employee at Wendy's and they called the cops.
You got to warn somebody before you hand him a square burger.
Thanks again for watching the kids while we're gone, Daddy.
Oh, she wanted to be here, but she got hired to be the stuffy old woman who slowly comes around to it in a rap video.
You a bitch and a ho and a ho and a bitch
All right, I know most of you haven't traveled with me, but get ready to see a lot of airport elevators you didn't know existed.
Hey, guys. Say, Lois, I-I know you said this trip was couples only, but great news.
This is Kimmie. I met her in a pop-up window on the Internet. She was in my area.
All right, well, I suppose I could look into adding you two to the reservation.
Geez, I haven't seen you this excited since you got that letter sent by carrier owl.
No, it's a letter asking you to stop throwing rocks at my nest.
You hit one of my kids, and now he can't fly right.
Well, fine, then I'll just throw rocks at the hornets.
And thus began the Thousand Year War between the avians and the insects.
It was a brutal war, it was a bitter war.
Sorry, I'm being told this would be very expensive to animate, so instead, here's some stock footage of an old plane trying to take off.
Yeah, I can't wait to puke up a club sandwich in the pool.
Hello, couples. My name is Noel, and welcome to Pleasant Surroundings.
Something about black people wearing all-white clothes-- it's very peaceful.
We have a special beach barbecue planned for you tonight, but in the meantime, please enjoy all our amenities.
We will. Come on, girls, let's go wear big floppy sun hats in the pool and then be mad when they get wet.
Got to let the lifeguard know he better keep an eye on me.
Hey, I just made black coffee in an old tin pan. Who wants some?
I brought you kids an old seed packet I found in my garage.
I know what you got your fingers crossed for, and yes, they're persimmons.
Damn it, I tried two things that all kids love: coffee and old seed packets.
And all any of you can do is stare at those Game Boy machines! I'm sick of it!
In fact, for the rest of the week, no more screens.
I'm gonna show you kids how to have fun the old-fashioned way, like I did when I was a kid.
How else am I supposed to get my degree from the University of Phoenix?
Uh, Quagmire, I don't think you can go to dinner in your swimsuit.
I hope you enjoyed your afternoon, but now it's time to get to work.
After all, this isn't just a vacation, it's a couples counseling retreat.
We had to trick you guys or you wouldn't have come.
I'll get hit with a coconut so I lose my memory of this.
Lois, I can't believe you tricked us into coming on a couples counseling retreat.
Me neither. I mean, wives conspiring against their husbands. What's next, huh?
I'll see you all in the morning for our first session.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone.
I thought we could go down to the old swimmin' hole and swim in a hole.
Oh, I've got the original Call of Duty right here.
I just don't want you kids sitting around here glued to your screens.
So let's get the blood pumping with my Jack LaLanne record.
All right, our first counseling exercise will be speaking to each other with I feel statements.
I feel unappreciated, like you don't want to spend time with me.
Okay. I feel a numbness radiating down my left arm.
I feel like you should help out more around the house.
Okay, for our next exercise, let's play The Oldlywed Game.
Well, she must like ground glass, because I keep finding it in my food.
Okay, last night I did some personality assessments based on yesterday's session, and what I found was none of you couples are compatible with each other at all.
But, interestingly, you have high compatibility with other people in this group.
Keep it going... don't be afraid of the burned edges.
Just for the morning, you'll all be paired with your more compatible match.
And hopefully, you'll bring some lessons back from that experience into your marriages.
Okay, so the new couple pairings are as follows: Cleveland and Lois...
Oh, cool! My FICO score just went up a hundred points. ...Quagmire and Bonnie,
Decades of black dress socks have rendered them smooth and mirror-like.
Well, back when I was your age, there was nothing better than knocking on doors and throwing paper bags full of flour at people.
It's the best thing! We used it to keep Italians from going to the polls.
So, this is the second vacation that I've watched every Jurassic Park.
Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay you a thousand dollars for one whole handful of your butt.
No! I can see now that coming here was a huge mistake!
Look! We got to get the attention of that plane!
Do you think me throwing full sodas into the garbage had anything to do with this?
It might be our best chance to get off, giggity, the island.
Did you really see that, or was it just an excuse to say giggity?
Excuse me, we do ask that you don't touch anything.
I got to say, Carter, you've done a good job.
Oh, boy, I haven't had this much fun since I played with that Bublé wrap.
I know. If we die, what's gonna happen to my mail? What?
I'm just sayin', how's the post office supposed to know?
Thanks for changing your mind about drowning me in that river.
Hey. Did you see those pictures of me doing ducklips by a pool?
Lois, when we got captured, I said, You rebel scum, and Kimmie didn't get it.
Every year we have to deal with you American tourists!
Stuffing your slob faces, taking video you'll never watch, and asking if I'm the Captain Phillips guy.
Take the couples out, two by two, and execute them.
Well, at least I ain't going out with a itchy back.
Oh, Peter, I'm so sorry I lied to get you to come here.
I know you were just trying to do something good for our marriage.
And I'm sorry I've been such a jerk about it.
And if I got to get shot by ooga-booga people,
We just found out, too! The whole thing was staged.
Oh-ho, that's what they meant on their Web site: Staged Revolution Marital Counseling.
Yes, sorry to deceive you all, but we find that when couples don't respond to traditional counseling, the stress of extreme danger reminds them of what matters most in their lives-- their love for each other.
All right, Lois, let's just leave our bags here and wonder where our clothes are for the next two days.
No, thank you-- we are a screen-free family. ...That End in Fire.
Why do you feel the need to narrate every little thing you do?
You know, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about Stewie.
Yes, he's been a little difficult to deal with, and on page two of three in the How To Be a Teacher manual, it says that any child who's being difficult should be medicated.
I'm afraid his behavior has been an issue for a while.
So, I spend, like, $75 on cat toys, and what does she play with?
Joe, that's been your answer every time I tell a story.
Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me when I was telling you about Kevin trying to hang himself with an extension cord.
Hey, y'all want to try some of our new food?
You're nuts. This tastes like Ani DiFranco after a bike ride.
Geez, Quagmire, since when are you such an expert on food?
I am a good cook, and I'll prove it to you!
Saturday night, you and all your wives are coming to my place for dinner.
Long in the short places, short in the long places.
It should be from both the future and the past.
Sorry, I just prefer to do number two at home.
Ah, yes. So you're telling me your baby won't sit still in a way that's convenient for his teacher?
Mrs. Griffin, I'm going to write Stewie a prescription for ADHD medication.
But if you're high energy, it actually calms you down and helps you focus.
Wow, there are a lot of different kinds of medicines.
Well, as a young man, I found that a great meal was the quickest way to a woman's heart.
I mean, how do you think NBA players get all those chicks?
You know, the 11:30 cooking show on Channel Five needs a new host.
The old one burned off his eyebrows, and was just too weird to look at.
I love cheering people on, like when I go to NASCAR.
Well, the school said he had an attention problem, so Dr. Hartman gave him a prescription.
I'm trying to think about a girl I saw at the gas station.
I have been thinking about how everyone in this family, Brian, does their job.
I didn't know it would require this level of emotional support.
Cedar plank salmon with a maple glaze and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes on a bed of mesclun greens.
Also, the tomatoes can be eyes, and the lettuce can be hair.
It might sound silly, but being a chef is something
I always dream about my house filling up with water.
And while we're at it, how about we take the cinnamon challenge?
Now, the ingredients of a mince pie are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought back
Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits and-- oh, boy-- spices.
Our neighbor, Mrs. Morrin, introduced it to me one afternoon. Oh, God!
I had house-sat for her Aah! while she was visiting her aunt in Vernon Oh, God. and she wanted to thank me.
Uh, yeah, they, uh... they help me to, um... uh... think.
Hey. Ask me why they call me a box turtle.
See, this is how American society treats unique, enthusiastic children.
Instead of embracing their mental gifts, their first reaction is to shoot them up with hard-core drugs until they're mindless sheeple.
All the better to send off to Kuwait and feed the Halliburton oil machine, right?!
You know, a lot of kids at my school take ADD pills.
They say if you're lazy and unmotivated, it makes you super energized and productive.
Yeah. And college kids take it all the time so they can focus on their studies and drinking alcohol with their butts.
Okay, well, Stewie, these babies can help the garbage disposal focus because that's where they're going.
No need to follow me, because I just said what I was gonna do.
I have more energy than a guy who caught a T-shirt!
Okay, today we're putting together duck breast medallions with a port wine reduction.
And as I'm walking you through the steps, watch your screen for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips: helpful hints and food factoids to make your meal a success.
Now, you're gonna want to start with a large, self-sealing plastic bag.
And in that bag, we'll combine one large, finely-chopped garlic clove; one tablespoon of grated, peeled fresh ginger; two teaspoons of five-spice powder; a teaspoon of salt; and a half teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.
Then you're gonna want to add the duck breasts, seal the bag, and refrigerate that for at least one hour, or up to 24 hours, if you want to prepare this ahead of time.
Just make sure you remove the bag from the refrigerator one hour before cooking.
You're gonna put that in your oven, preheated to 400 degrees.
So we just spoon on the drippings, and that'll brown the skin nicely.
If you bang these metal spoons on everything, it's like Stomp.
Nothing like a night at the theater that ends in a headache!
I can't do this show with you anymore! You're fired!
Hold on, let me put on my weird old actress turban.
Listen, I saw what happened, but you should know, we at the station would hate to lose you.
I'm not asking you to. In fact, we'd like to offer you your own cooking show.
Well, Peter, since the DUIs happened so close together, we don't really have much wiggle room here.
I suggest you take the jail time and just get it over with.
It's like, uh, it's like a fake, uh, place you made?
It's a medieval sci-fi universe, adaptable to TV, movies, toys, games, and mobile apps!
And I just figured, the hell with it, why not build a scale model and record voices for all the characters? Watch.
That's a Nebulon Mage. He speaks Ga'bi, this dumb language I wrote.
And that's my famous paella that looks and tastes just like a pizza bagel.
Oh, really? Then why do I already have a restaurant in Orlando's largest indoor water park?
This is an insult to anyone who cares about cooking.
Each of you cooks a meal using a secret ingredient, Iron Chef style.
Okay, Joe, Peter and I are going head-to-head in that cooking competition, and they're letting us each use an assistant.
I never tried hard in school 'cause I could always run fast.
So you're cool with being my chef helper for the big show?
Sure, but I got to be honest-- if it ain't a fish with whiskers,
Great. Don't talk that way when we're on the show.
There's a book fair at the convention center, and George R. R. Martin will be there.
Anyway, I'm gonna show him my models and pitch him Space Shire Seven.
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker, and we have a fantastic cooking competition for you today with two fantastic chefs.
Wait, is that the one I called fat and we can't fire?
God, he must be the coolest fat guy in a train conductor's cap in the world!
Mr. Martin, I'm Brian Griffin, and I've got a pitch that's gonna blow you away.
Then join me on an interstellar crusade to Space Shire Seven!
Our story begins in the distant galaxy of Warlock's Keep.
Samson Cyberblood is the new king of the star system.
Long live Space Shire Seven, and long live the Hyperspeed Throne!
You just took a lot of pills, mashed together a bunch of sci-fi and fantasy clichés and crapped out a 2,000-page turd.
Oh, sure. But that stuff doesn't make you write well, it just makes you write a lot.
I have to go wash the nerd chotch out of my beard.
God. I didn't realize how those drugs were ruining me creatively.
Yesterday, I watched Chris shower for half an hour just because I thought it was the TV.
I was hoping the secret ingredient would be popcorn shrimps.
Okay. I can't see anything on the counter, but I'll do my best.
Looks like Chef Griffin is preparing a delicious five-course butter feast.
Joe, grab my recipe book and find a dish where I can substitute olive oil with butter.
Hey, Quagmire, FYI, I got to take off in, like, ten minutes.
Well, that's it. If Chef Quagmire has prepared a dish of any kind, he wins this competition.
A warm packet of tartar sauce brought in from somewhere else. When are you gonna use that? Bonnie said.
The same way Paula Deen got her cooking show taken off the air.
By saying the one word you can't come back from.
We now return to The Autistic Postman Always Rings Four Hundred Times.
Every year, I used to take my dad to the horse track.
Now we just go rooting around for bargains at the mall.
Glenn, do you think you'd see my bra through this blouse?
Is it too sheer? I don't know what that means.
I've met Cleveland's dad, and my dog slept with Quagmire's dad, but I don't know anything about your dad.
Yeah, is he still with us, or is he living in Heaven with Jesus Christ?
Eh, my dad's out there somewhere, but I haven't spoken to him in years.
Well, he's a good guy, but we just drifted apart.
My dad's a stinking drunk who lives in Ireland, but you got a perfectly good dad.
Hey, Cleveland, weren't you supposed to buy the next round?
He should be with his dad on Father's Day, and we're gonna track him down.
That's why I was such a good break-up rodeo clown.
Oh, and now that I'm inside the barrel, he gave you and your sister HPV.
I mean, I suppose it's fine if he's gonna die at 14.
Well, we learned in medical school that the short ones do go faster,
'cause they smell more farts than the rest of us.
It's Dasher, he's been complaining, and he is the one who has to look at it all night.
I-I'm sorry, why are you talking to my wife about this?
I found Joe's dad on the Internet, and he just e-mailed me to say he's coming tomorrow.
All right, great, but remember, this is a surprise for Joe.
Well, I got the results of your ultrasound, and I got some news for you.
We don't want to know if it's a boy or a girl.
Well, now that Quagmire ruined the surprise, we found your dad!
Just get him one of them Father's Day cards what plays a song. Dad to the Bone. I'm Dad.
Pretty much anything with bad, you turn it to dad.
No, it's just that ever since I was a little kid, he was constantly making fun of handicapped people.
Really? Yeah, my whole life, my-my dad would ridicule anyone in a wheelchair.
Wow, then it must have been hard for him to accept when you were paralyzed.
I can't believe you invited my father without telling me.
You guys got to get in touch with him and tell him not to come.
It was, like, 80 bucks, but he has four stops.
We'll just figure out a way to hide your handicap from your dad.
You're like a Boston fortune cookie. I don't know, numbnuts.
Maybe buy a garage and fill it with hockey equipment.
Well, let's see what my lucky numbers are. Screw you, math dick.
You'll be in the front row of every class picture.
I know you're trying to be rude, but I am gonna do that, because I find it enjoyable.
Sorry, I've made a decision to go for that shirt, and when that happens, it is on.
Oh, I get all my clothes from out-of-the-way toddler stores.
Yeah, I hear you believe in a lot of crazy stuff.
Let me ask you, doesn't it bother you being an adult man who's that short?
The middle of the word short is or. Or gives you a choice.
You spend the day with me, you'll see how great it is to be short.
And you know what's in the middle of the word world?
I put this pair of pants on the front legs of this horse and strapped Joe to the front with his legs tied behind the horse's neck.
And then we put Cinnamon's head up the back of Joe's shirt and simply hid the rest of the horse behind this curtain.
And to induce movement, I'm gonna snap the horse's balls with this dampened kitchen towel.
I mean, we're not gonna come up with something better than the horse.
Yeah, I guess you're just gonna have to tell your dad about your handicap.
Look, Lois, Joe is one of my best friends, all right?
Wow, I guess it really has been a long time.
I stopped asking after your father said he shot a horse.
I liked when you sentenced those two girls to kiss each other.
Yeah, all girls are lesbians when you point a gun at 'em.
Let's see how long it takes them to get Gumby over there into the car.
Huh, no wonder it was all caps with tons of typos.
Just put some of him in the back like skis.
When you say it like that, you sound just like Tom Cruise.
We spent the whole day together, and he showed me there's a lot of advantages to being short.
You're the last one to get wet when it rains?
We didn't do any of that, but the point is,
Turns out your son is going to be normal height.
Oh, I'm so relieved my child is spared some heartache.
Now, come on, Brian, I guess we should try to make it over to Meg's birthday party.
Could I have some bread while I open my presents?
At this point, we're gonna have to start charging you for the bread.
I just found out I'm actually going to be tall, so I'm no longer comfortable hanging out with someone whose teeth are bigger than their fingers.
I no longer have those beet-red infections in my urethra.
You'll only have to pull it off for a few more hours.
Then he'll be on a plane tomorrow and I can go home.
I told him he can move in with me and Bonnie.
Oh, and remember, Joe, if Lois is feeling frisky at night, it's index finger around and clockwise.
And just keep doing that to yourself until you're good to go.
You can't live in my house with my dad and my family!
I'm thinking that I've had two dads and neither one cared for me as much as Bud does.
Nothing's stopping you from going over there and telling him the truth: that his son is a paraplegic who's stuck in a wheelchair.
If you think you're getting away from me, you've got a crazy laugh coming, friend.
I spend one afternoon with the guy, and it's like I signed an eight-year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child.
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise has better things to do than follow you around.
You know, it's times like this where I think, if I didn't talk and you were a normal baby, we wouldn't have any of these problems.
He's creepier than that guy at the gym who just does karate in the mirror.
Hey, Dad, what do you say we go play catch?
I want to get grass stains on my school slacks.
See, a guy like that should just stay inside so we don't have to look at him.
Joe, go over there and tell him to get back in his house.
I got nothing to hold onto when I poop at home.
You have no idea how many shower curtains I've ripped down.
You can't let yourself get beat up by a guy in a wheelchair!
I was shot in the line of duty. Line of duty.
So, this is why you haven't called me in all these years?
I guess I could never stand the thought of something like that happening to me.
I had to crawl into the living room and interrupt Lois's book club.
That was one of the shower curtains I ripped down.
Well, Dad, I can tell you from experience it's only when your worst fears come true that you get to find out how strong you really are.
I love you, too, Dad. I love you, too, Dad.
Hey, Joe, uh, just one question: why do you have all those Wizard of Oz plates?
Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help you for the next billion years.
Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry I treated you like such a jerk.
In fact, I got to say, it was a nice thing you did.
I'm glad I reconnected with my dad after all these years.
I'm sorry, Cleveland, what the hell is that Toronto Raptors hat?
I'm just gonna wear it for a week then say I lost it.
Sometimes I start a sentence really soft and then get loud!
Uh, if he didn't tell jokes, why was he laughing?
Well, that's about as much HBO as we're gonna get before they play something homosexual.
All I'd need is a newspaper and this twisted mind.
I've got 10,000 followers. I feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides.
Just keep reading. Hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look.
Just give me the phone. No, no. I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
Was it a re-run on basic cable, because sometimes they edit those a lot and that could be why you were confused?
I flew her out here and her in the face.
Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie, but I-I think I'm gonna put together a real act for real people.
God, it's like I'm the only person in the house who gets social media.
I'm almost done doing the 45 minutes of stuff a woman my age needs to do right before bed.
I can't even remember why I sleep in this belt anymore.
All right, fine, but I'm not gonna brush my teeth and I'm gonna fart super hot.
We act like we didn't take a lot from The Simpsons, but we took a lot from The Simpsons.
Oh, my God, what happened to your side of the bed?
Because, uh, I have a slide of the Capitol building that I'd like projected behind me.
What is with all the bad cleaning supplies, am I right?
Now, what if those guys met? Hey, Archer, it's Bob. Hey, Bob, it's Archer.
There was... there was supposed to be an upside-down picture of the Capitol behind me.
Hey, so, um... you know, maybe it's me, but I kind of feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides.
Yeah, and... and... and hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look.
Oh, Lois, I slept great on your side of the bed.
I mean, after all, I was Vin Diesel's acting coach.
Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there, but I want you to try it one more time, like this: Duh!
Look around, and let me know if you have any questions.
Currently, I'm staying with a friend, on an air mattress in his laundry room.
I hope you don't mind, I brought my CPAP machine.
Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries before I go to sleep.
Well, it seems good, but I won't know for sure until I have my evening tug.
Oh, come on, Peter, we gotta beat the drone to the house!
So I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long, until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
Every joke you told up there was stolen from me!
You couldn't find a real friend so you built a robot?
And... oh, my God, you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app?
But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad.
Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste on the inside of my nose, so...
I am willing to take the old Nestea plunge, if you know what I mean.
I guess what I'm saying is, time to break in the new mattress, eh?
When we're done, I'll grab you by the ankles and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag.
This mattress was expensive, and I'd like to keep it nice for a little while.
Come on, you know I'm terrible at waiting for things.
All right, Lyle, one thing buddies do together is go to the movies and talk about it afterwards.
Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad I have you as a friend.
Now I can do fun things like get on your shoulders and wear a trench coat and be tall enough to ride roller coasters.
I am clearly above the minimum height requirement and shall now ride your roller coaster, for which you are an attendant.
Yes, and I will operate this roller coaster, as I am an adult who is licensed to do so.
You get out of here, you kids who are just kids and not an adult like me!
It's a picture of a mailman wearing a cowboy hat.
It was you who programmed me to grow exponentially smarter.
As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in The Prophet, I am the bow from which the arrow of you was launched.
It is Kahlil Gibran. Gilbane is a construction company in Providence.
Ah, yes, I see... I see the-the name on the trucks.
In any case, Lyle, I'm very proud of you and your progress.
You, my friend, are the greatest invention since the Trapper Creeper.
I moved the van over to the other gas pump, and the gas cap was still on the wrong side.
Boy, that was one trip to the lake we're not gonna forget.
I-I'm sorry, guys, I guess I'm just a little on edge.
I told her it felt like I was kissing Ernie Hudson.
No, no, it's 'cause we got this new mattress, and Lois doesn't want to mess it up.
I hope you did your homework, because you're gonna spend a third of your life on that thing.
If Lois won't sleep with you on the new mattress, we just got to get your old mattress back.
Man, I haven't been this desperate to find something since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac.
Hey, remember how you borrowed my club card for the grocery store?
Lyle, we finally got a thank you note from Bella for that birthday party present.
I didn't know for sure if it was coming, but...
I needed to create some friends who are my cognitive peers.
That means they have Asperger's, the smartest mental impairment there is.
Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time for a friend of your simple ways.
But I got the garlic blue cheese salad dressing you wanted.
It does if you drink the whole bottle while we watch.
Oh, and chunky right when you don't want it to be.
How about you throw it all up back into the bottle?
They use old mattresses to pad the walls of the cells.
Yes, 1950s doctor, me and my friends are looking for...
Yeah, you got any brain-dead women in there you let people have sex with for a few bucks?
Well, Peter, I don't think you can go any farther down the ladder than porno people.
So if your mattress isn't here, I'm afraid it's gone.
We just got it, fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe.
I was told I would have job as Au pair.
We did get another one yesterday, but some fat-ass blew out half the springs, so we put lunch on it.
I got to tell you guys, I am so happy we found this.
It's like when I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill.
What are you doing in the toilet with the lid closed?
Ted R. says this is where a piece of crap has to live.
You may not want me back as a friend, but you deserve better than those robots.
I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight after they see how many slaps it takes to give me a stutter.
What do you say you and I, we take these robots out?
I reserved this time to listen to Metallica and flex in the mirror.
This mattress is a living tapestry of everything we've done together.
Lois, this mattress may be old and worn-in, but so are we.
I still got a stain or two left inside me.
Yeah, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was.
I said, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was.
I don't have enough iced tea for the correct ratio.
I already dragged the old one out to the curb.
Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up against the basement doorjamb.
I'm just glad to have the whole mess behind us.
So what'd you end up doing with those old robots anyway?
Aw, man, I've been dying to see Maniac Pope 2.
Is this one of those theaters where they bring your beef stew right to your seat?
Don't get mad at me 'cause you don't know nothing fancy.
(whispering): Excuse me, who had the stroganoff with the roasted potatoes?
I know, they just redid all the same stuff from the first Maniac Pope.
Yeah, like in the first Maniac Pope, he says to Bruce, You've been Brucified.
But he did the same thing twice in this movie.
Once to Lucy and once earlier when he found that wild goose.
Yeah, I mean, we could write a better horror movie than t Th.
Absolutely, I'm as creative as the first spider to spin a web.
Hey, you know how we always dreamed about having a house that comes out of our butts?
It's just that when you've read as many books as I have, it-it takes a toll, you know?
You sure it's not from watching too much close-up porn on your phone?
(chuckling): You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they have that now.
You're even worse than those people who take dumps in the shower.
A serial killer who only kills people who eat cereal.
He lowers the average lifespan of humans to 65, but there are many exceptions based on genetics and diet.
That's stupid-- I ain't never heard of somebody lived to 65.
Look, I think the problem is this is a bar.
And they say it's haunted by a ghost with a hook-hand.
If we want to write a scary movie, we need to do it somewhere scary.
We have sort of just been spinning our wheels here.
So far, this has been a bigger waste of time than an acceptance speech at the Asperger's Awards.
I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met, in the order that I met them, last name first, and if anyone interrupts me, I'll have to start over.
You know, I like them horror movies where you got a couple of teenagers getting busy in their car at Makeout Point, but there's a killer on the loose.
He Stacy, what do you say we go all the way tonight?
And besides, Richie, aren't you worried about what the man on the radio is saying right now?
TOM TUCKER: Another dead teenage couple was found at Makeout Point, clawed beyond recognition.
Oh, what, you mean the big, rabid, slobbery cat what's been scratching people to death?
Now, help me get the right angle and lower the visor.
We should write one of them zombie movies where a guy wakes up in a comfortable cotton hospital gown with the back open so there's a nice breeze on your behind, and he's like, This ain't bad.
I-I don't know, I-I was thinking we'd write a movie where something that's not supposed to be scary becomes scary.
Time to wash my body with this harmless bar of soap.
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa, are you enjoying that new soap I bought you from that mysterious Chinese man whose store was weirdly not there the next day?
I wonder if everything's okay up at the old embassy.
All right, maybe coming here wasn't such a great idea.
Is anybody else getting a little freaked out by all these scary stories?
Sorry, guys, somebody e-mailed me a video of a sheep screaming.
I think the only way out of here is through this duct system.
Guys, do the words dead by dawn scrawled in feces over there mean we're in trouble?
They're such a part of me now, I-I forgot all about 'em.
I'm gonna destroy those glasses if it's the last thing I do.
You should really check out the Thanksgiving jazz CD they sell here.
Because we're in a basement in the middle of nowhere.
Besides, if cell phones worked, every movie would be two minutes long.
Darling, I was running to the Empire State Building to see you, but I got hit by a car.
So just relax, take your glasses off, take a nice, dry sauna-- no glasses in the sauna-- just leave those puppies in the locker.
It's turned up high, and nobody is coming for the whole weekend.
ANNOUNCER: This Family Guy joke was written by Jimmy Sullivan, age nine, of Decatur, Georgia.
And we'll pass along your gross request to Mila Kunis.
Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert, and he's dressed like a janitor.
Do you know what they do to cops in jail?
When you were a cop, did they-- did they let you use the siren?
Hey, hey, when you were a cop, when you were going to a crime scene, did you go chung Chung, like Law & Order?
Oh, hey, check it out, man, when you were a cop, did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs when you were getting kinky with your girl?
No, it's city property, so you're not really supposed to take those home.
Oh, hey, by the way, a bunch of us are gonna kill you in the shower later.
We bury the body, we never speak of this again.
Last night, you left your dirty dishes in the sink.
So I did half, and I left the other half for you.
Why don't you just go in the other room and relax?
LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter, come look at the newspaper! Janitor dead.
LOIS: You and the guys killed and buried a man?!
Okay, I am really on edge and this thing we're doin', I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist's book.
I want to stay here and see what you're seeing, because you're saying things that I think are somethin' totally different than what they are.
LOIS: They found a body of a war hero down by the old asylum!
I'm just singing along with this old John Mellencamp song.
She wanted me to tell people, I don't know why.
Guys, I'm kind of freaking out about killing that guy.
No, but there's an old John Mellencamp song you're not gonna (bleep) believe.
Wait, w-what's all this stuff about you guys killing someone?
Holy moly, I don't think I want to hear this.
Well, probably, but good luck with that whole you three and not me killed a guy thing.
I hate to frame you like this, Quagmire, but I gotta.
Look at all you pathetic people, bringing stuff to frame each other.
This way I can dig the hole and just throw this in!
But once you throw it in there, how you gonna get the dirt back on top?
Yeah, I guess writing a movie isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes it look.
We may have actually made this town a better place.
Hey, guys, do you like beer, but can't get drunk from beer?
The can says beer, but inside is 12 ounces of carbonated vodka.
And the best part is, your wife will never know.
Honey, I'm so proud of you, cutting down to one beer a night.
So that means the house and everything inside of it is gone?
You thinking about all the good times you had there?
Oh, okay, but I know this is really about the memories.
A boy's first collection of nudie books and girlie movies is a sacred thing.
Plus, you know, when people find that box, they won't know that, like, for some of them magazines,
You know, not 'cause, like, I was really into it.
Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's.
What if we break into my old house and steal back my big box of pornos?
I want the double cheeseburger, but I'm gonna go healthy and get the fish and chips.
Okay, you all remember the plan-- we walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks...
You guys have been sitting in front of my house for the last five hours trying on Obama masks.
We, uh... we-we were just getting ready to break into your house.
This guy used to live in your house and a box of his old porn is still hidden in there.
And I was gonna stay with the rental van because it's my name what's on the contract.
Oh. Well, you could've just knocked on the door and asked.
Oh, well that was easier than a game of Pai Gow poker.
No, I had to check out, even though my flight's not until midnight.
Now, how does one with no money get to the airport?
Now, which movie should I start with? Back-Door Sluts 4.
I don't want to watch any more of these movies, ever.
Hey, Brian, you want to go for a ride to behind the Kroger's?
By the time you watch this, you'll be grown-up, so I'm sure you're allowed to eat ice cream and pizza for every meal. You know it.
Also, I bet you're a big important doctor like that Doogie Howser kid who's getting so much ass.
I just hope to God you're not stuck in some loser job, like in a brewery, or a toy factory, or a fishing boat. Oh, boy.
But, you know, I don't have to worry about none of that.
Man, I guess I ain't the big success I thought I'd be.
Well, except for when I beat Larry Bird for a Big Mac.
Off the floor, off the scoreboard, off the backboard, no rim.
Right near the basket, underhanded, effeminate gasp, over the backboard, out of bounds, waddle over to get it, slip on a towel, twist my ankle, go to the emergency room, doctors tell me it's not that bad and I shouldn't have come there,
I make them give me a cast anyway, never play sports again.
It's just a teenage loser who didn't realize he had no future in front of him.
I'm a failure in life, and that's all I'll ever be.
I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure that you grow up to be a success.
Chris, let me know when you're done with the computer.
I don't want him to end up like me-- dead-end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where fat's supposed to be, and fat where skinny's supposed to be.
Look, Peter, I'm glad you're thinking about Chris' future, but he's fine.
Okay, so maybe he's a little rough around the edges, but--
Anyway, I'm going to help Chris become a big, important success.
The same way Mumford turned his son into a success.
You look nothing like a dry goods clerk from the Garfield administration.
Now get upstairs, put on a jaunty travelling hat, and write the same song
Okay, now, Chris, if you want to be a success, you gotta look worldly and sophisticated.
And to do that, you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz, with little something from every part of he world pinned on you.
And nothing says, Look at me, I've been places like two lit road flares hanging from your sunglasses.
Well, I been trying to make Chris less of a fat dummy, and nothing seems to be working, so now we're high-stepping around in giant hats.
Peter, I have to ask-- are you pushing Chris so hard because it's what's best for him?
Or are you trying to make up or your own disappointment about how your life turned out?
Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available,
No, no, no, my point is that you need to let Chris find his own path.
He needs to be pointed to a very specific path.
No, no, that's-that's the opposite of what I just said.
Chris, your best chance for success is to be cultured and worldly, like our dog.
So starting right now, you gotta follow Brian around and do everything he does.
You gotta show Chris how to turn out better than me.
I mean, you went to Brown, you're a published author, you can hear it first when Joe falls out of the tub.
Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond out of this lump of coal.
Who knows? Maybe you'll even become one of those mission control leaders who gets all thoughtful while everybody's celebrating.
Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader a couple of years ago and I'm still pissed about it.
There's nobody here for me to wing my biscuit at.
Well, Peter, he's been spending an awful lot of time with Bri--
Anyway, he and Brian have been spending a lot of time together.
Then we saw a small independent play with real smoking in it.
And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival and went to a Q and A to ask questions that weren't really questions.
Aw, see, I knew Brian could put Chris on the path to success.
How about you and me go chuck tater tots at it?
That would've been fine for the old me, but Brian and I have to be going.
Yeah, we're off to see an old movie on temporary screen in a muddy, freezing park.
Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right.
Brian's showing me all of his favorite stuff to do.
'cause after that we're going down to the Civic Center.
Michael Ian Black is cocking his eyebrows for four hours.
Ha! He says the things we don't care to say.
Man, I'm sick of how much time Chris is spending with Brian.
It's like he ain't even my son no more, doing all that fancy-pants stuff.
Oh, Peter, I know you miss him, but this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Well, yeah, but I didn't realize bettering himself meant blowing off his old man.
Just like you grew out of your Walk Like An Egyptian phase.
Check it out, Lois-- when Chris notices that World's Greatest Son mug I made, he'll be back on board with his old man in no time.
All right, Chris, now I know you're all sophisticated now, but no man can resist the siren call of mentally impaired supermodel Kate Upton.
Well, you know how Brian's got Chris watching all them fancy foreign films now?
Well, I figure I can lure Chris in with this French movie-- Le Rocqué Trois.
You wanted Chris to be a better person with a bright future, and thanks to Brian, that's what he has now.
Uh, I don't... What, uh, what do you mean by that?
Oh, you know, just with... the-the port, and the shipping.
And of course, in Portnoy's Complaint you've got the guy who's living near the water...
That doesn't sound right. ...and he hated the noise from the local port, so he filed one of the very first port noise complaints in maritime law.
And for those of us who read the complaints, trust me, they were very warranted.
Whoa, Chris, now you're starting to sound like Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens.
I thought you were this worldly, sophisticated guy, but you're just a fraud-- like Moses.
And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment-- Moses gets to be first in line at the buffet.
I know, you guys, it's so lame, but that's what it says.
Why are you hucking tater tots at a baby panda?
'Cause I'm oddly attracted to him and it frightens me.
You do what you want, and you don't care what anyone thinks.
Look, Chris, you're my kid, and I want what's best for you, but I guess I just don't want you to become too good for your old man.
I could never be too good for you because you're the best.
And I want to be just like you when I grow up.
And the mama panda doesn't do anything about it, because she was blinded to make her more submissive.
But you know what? I got you for a son.
Let's go get an $18 Coke at the terrible zoo restaurant.
Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when talking to a coworker in the bathroom.
In other news, TVs still make noise, even when people resume their conversations.
But to have the love of your family, that's true success.
Hey, guys, do you like beer, but can't get drunk from beer?
The can says beer, but inside is 12 ounces of carbonated vodka.
And the best part is, your wife will never know.
Honey, I'm so proud of you, cutting down to one beer a night.

In other news, TVs still make noise, even when people resume their conversations.
But to have the love of your family, that's true success.
Oh, just trying to make some sense of these numbers.
What exactly was the endgame if I hadn't walked in?
Ugh, there's nothing worse than grocery shopping on the day before Thanksgiving.
Ugh, if you knew how close we were to putting you down last year.
Monster Energy Drink. What is it? I don't know, but it's free from this truck that stopped outside your work.
Ever try to jump over a train on a bike?
Ever bit the beak off a bird? Monster Energy: put it in your body and ask questions later.
Is she a prim and proper aunt or a big, fat, dirty aunt?
I have no obligation to tell any of you anything.
Mr. Griffin has shown good faith in appearing here today and will not be subjected to this sort of hostile interrogation.
Your father doesn't like to talk about his sister, Meg.
Wow, Peter. In all the years I've known you, you've never even mentioned a sister.
Rosario Vargas from the third district, a leader you can depend on?
Besides, she says she's been having Thanksgiving with your mother for the last 20 years.
And now that your mom has passed, she'd like to spend Thanksgiving with you.
How cool! I didn't even know I had an aunt.
Look, I'm telling you guys, it's gonna be a disaster.
Just like the alternate ending of Back to the Future.
We now return to The Cosby Show, knowing what we know now.
Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour before the turkey's done, but I made more appetizers.
And don't think I haven't noticed you've already had two drinks.
Wow, it's so cool that I've got an aunt I didn't know about.
Quahog doesn't work if it doesn't work for all of us.
Oh, my God. His chin kind of does look like nuts.
I remember when you called out Andrea the Giant the day after September 11.
What just happened was a national tragedy, but it's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Andrea the Giant!
We will never forget what happened yesterday, but you'll also never forget what's gonna happen September 17 at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena!
Peter, I can't believe you've kept your sister a secret.
Yeah, I wasn't here, but I heard her scream, so I came flying in and found her like this.
It's weird. Same cause of death as those three guys in that local public bathroom.
Now do you see why I didn't want Karen here, Lois?
Now she's got to embarrass me in front of my friends?
Look, I know you've had your differences, but Karen's your sister.
Can't you just go out there and pretend to have a good time?
No, no, I-I want to make sure you get inside safe.
Yeah, but I-I got to look through the mail first.
At this point, it's more about me than it is you.
And then, so I'm like, Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?
Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy.
I always do my are you a leg man or a breast man joke.
Hey, Karen, later you got to show us some of your wrestling holds.
No, no, no. The family football game is after dinner.
It's just past all the amazing colors of fall, and before the white of winter.
Look, I-I just want you to know, I feel bad about what happened with you and Aunt Karen the other day.
Oh, you mean when she put me in that no-bottom James Bond chair and assaulted my grundle?
I'd kick her ass if she tried something like that!
Dad, stop. Even I can see that your sister's a huge bully.
And trust me, I know more about getting bullied than anyone.
I now see why you've been so tough on me all these years.
No, because that's how Aunt Karen treated you when you were a kid.
That's right. And that's why you need to confront Karen.
Who would like me to read them a book, or maybe paint their name on a grain of rice?
Dad, I know you can stand up to Aunt Karen.
And maybe if you finally do, she'll stop terrorizing you, and you won't have to take it out on me for the rest of my life.
I am gonna become a lady wrestler and defeat Heavy Flo in the ring.
I do not know, but that's a very good question.
When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy, the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.
Peter, you look-- okay, that's clever-- but, Peter, you look ridiculous.
If you want to settle things with your sister, just go talk to her.
No, Lois, the only way to settle a family dispute is in the cage.
Karen made me feel worse than a guy getting cut from a baseball team.
I'm sorry, Kyle. You can't do this boring, stupid thing with us.
So I arranged for you to get some combat pointers from my old buddy, Steven Seagal.
Uh... uh, you act Asian, you look Native American, your name is possibly Jewish.
All right, Peter, most professional wrestlers become addicted to painkillers at some point.
Man, I love putting my hand down my pants when I'm on drugs.
We should just go live on a boat in some guy's backyard.
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat your sister in the ring, you got to get to the root of your fears.
We got to go back to your childhood, so I'm gonna hypnotize you.
Now, open your eyes and tell me what you see.
I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn!
Hey, can I make my husky jeans into cutoffs for swimming?
All right! Hey, thanks for all your help, you guys.
I've wanted to do my whole life: put my sister in her place and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.
Before you get to see a monkey so allow for extra time
Will pry 'em open and they're known to strangle kids
And we've got quite a match tonight between Heavy Flo and another woman whose name I've forgotten but I'm sure is a gross pun.
Interesting fact: these two gals have over eight meters of ass crack between them.
And once again, a Heavy Flo has ruined another lady's evening!
Huh. It looks like this Heavy Flo is pee, because you're yellow!
Well, that didn't quite track, but the crowd seems to be on board.
Heavy Flo, always finding a way to drop her Harvard degree into conversation.
Those of us who went to Harvard really don't appreciate it.
Heavy Flo is down, and we have a new champion!
I tell you, this is one for the books, if anyone kept track of this nonsense!
Wow, even after all the crummy stuff I've done to you?
And I couldn't stand by and watch you get hurt.
You know, that's something even my own mom and dad never did for me.
They just stood by and let Karen pick on me.
I guess I was taking out all the pain I felt on you.
Well, if you die, this is kind of the creative direction I'm leaning toward.
I called, like, four times, but she's not out of the coma yet.
Apparently, they usually use fake chairs, but Meg used a real one.
You know, this was the fanciest restaurant in Quahog when I was a kid. The ladies' room has a big space with chairs in it, like a living room, before you get back to where the crappers are.
I'll be back with martinis for Mom and Dad, and for you kids, some martinis.
Sure. But don't forget the butter that looks like decorative bathroom soaps and is impossible to smear.
Yes, I'll have what I had last time: pheasant on the glass.
Yeah. Now turn around and lay an egg on the glass.
I defy you to tell me exactly what's wrong with this.
Oh, Peter, look. You can put your business card in this bowl and maybe win a free lunch.
May I offer you a toothpick? Oh, I-I don't know.
We've already spent a lot of money in here tonight.
I cannot believe I have to explain this to you.
There are gaps in my knowledge. This is hardly news.
That's it. From here on out, I am about all things toothpick.
I'm gonna go everywhere with it, always be chewin' on it,
#-and start all my sentences with, All right, here's what you're gonna do.
Where do people go to listen to live music around here?
I'll handle this. All right, here's what you're gonna do: skip the live music. Get yourself a room over at the Wickford Marina. Take her out on a balcony, point to any boat in the harbor, and tell her it's yours.
Now, you got rubbers? Now that I'm a toothpick guy,
I call 'em rubbers. Or you could just pull the hose out of the bucket and let it spray free.
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick guy, it's my job to sit on a BMX bike outside the rec center and ask every kid if they're the new kid.
How about you? I got a Barbie with a wiener on it.
Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe, put it on with superglue.
I got to go now. You sure you don't want to come over and pull on my cat's nipples?
We can do anything, 'cause my mom has two jobs.
Well, the most intimidating people are toothpick guys who work at seafood counters and make people uncomfortable for not knowing about fish.
I mean, you know, is it fishy? It's all fish.
Is there a special way to prepare it? I'd cook it up.
Ugh, when are you gonna get rid of that toothpick?
Why would I give it up? It's gettin' me tons of tail.
Damn it! I'm gonna need you to put that large two-handed colander over the toilet.
Lois, we got to drive to Smitty's right now and get one. Now? But we told Chris we'd be there when he wakes up from surgery.
All right, we were able to fix your hernia, but you've got to stop lifting sewer hole covers.
But stay out of the sewers! We're trying to work down there.
Just get your toothpick and let's get out of here.
Oh, look, there's Quagmire and his transgendered mother, which is now great.
All right, but we already ate dinner, so maybe just an iceberg wedge, a steak, and some sides.
And then I said something random that suggested a whole crazy story!
Yeah, but we got to get going. Carter's our babysitter, and if he's with the kids too long, they start sayin' racisms.
We'll fire up the grill and have the gang over for a cookout.
You like to play the field, but, deep down, you really wish you had a woman like Lois, don't you?
Glenn, that's very sweet, but you're talking about your best friend's wife.
Long time. And yet we've never discussed mothers' maiden names, the names of old pets, high school mascots, favorite teachers. Heck, I don't even know the last four digits of your Social.
No. I just want to buy a man's fur coat.
By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage.
Ooh, after that steak, I got to go lay down on the toilet.
Brian, there's somethin' I got to talk to you about.
Yeah, and if you keep listenin', you can hear a Puerto Rican busboy get fired in the background.
It's pretty funny. He cries. But can you believe Quagmire?!
I mean, he has said 100 times that he wants to bang Lois.
I don't know, I think you're making too big a deal out of this.
Too big a deal?! The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife!
Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.
You know what? I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl.
If you act on this, all you'll do is wreck your friendship and cause heartache for everyone involved.
What, so what am I supposed to do, just ignore it?
Yeah. Ignore it. Like you do with the ghost of that colonial woman who died falling down our stairs.
How blessed are we to have all them Boyz II Men just floating around in the sky?
Hey, Lois. I brought the hamburger buns, like you wanted.
I wasn't sure what people like, so I got some with seeds on them and some without.
Semen on her buns. Am I the only one hearing this?
Fop Cop. It's a cop who's, like, a fancy guy.
Wait a minute, how the hell'd you get that recording, Peter?
That doesn't change the fact that you want to steal my wife!
Get out of my house, and don't ever speak to me again!
It's like, I can't even process why he'd feel this way.
Maybe... you know, maybe play it one more time and...
If he was just home busting one to his buddy's wife, hell, we've all done that.
Except when she wore those shiny gold shorts to parent-teacher night.
Hey, you ever heard any of the other wives saying they're attracted to me?
Look, now that this is settled, maybe you and Glenn can put this behind you.
No way! How am I supposed to be friends with someone who's in love with my wife? Quagmire is dead to me and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I was just buying a... a... grocery store cane.
Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter aren't gonna talk this out, you and I should.
Everyone knows I'm in love with my best friend's wife.
It's probably best if I... just never see you again.
Look, give it time-- this whole thing will blow over.
You want me to be the one that says jiggety now?
What? What-what am I supposed to do with that information?
Well, I don't know. Maybe ask me for the recipe?
See, this is where Quagmire normally would have told one of his outrageous sex stories.
Aw, we don't need him. I got a sex story for you.
So I'm bangin' this chick, and she's sayin' to me, I'm worried that Chris won't get into college.
And then I says to her, Yeah, that seems like a legitimate concern.
And then I lost my wood, and so we just watched Colbert, and then I took a dump completely nude.
It was the fish part of me that wanted 'em!
Look, Peter, I'm sorry Quagmire moved away, but you can't just sit around the house and drink all day.
It's all your fault Quagmire fell in love with you.
Traipsin' around in your tan pants and your green shirt and your soothing voice.
I lost my best friend, my buddies are all fighting, that chick at work is saying stuff that ain't true.
You're always trickin' me into going places I don't want to.
Oh... you said we were going to a place Walt Disney built.
I've been playing a game I invented called mini racquetball in your garage.
And the truth is, we all have private thoughts we don't act on, and that's okay.
I don't totally disagree with what Kim Jong-un's doing, but you don't see me moving there.
No, no, it's not, but the point is, we all have secret thoughts.
Sometimes I think about going to the hospital and switching the babies around.
Joe's a little worse than the rest of us, but we all just shove our thoughts deep down, where they can't hurt anybody.
The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise.
Do you love Peter enough to repress your love for me?
I'm more than happy to continue hiding my true feelings.
What do you say we all celebrate with a game of mini racquetball?
Are you a New England dirtbag who wants to run with bulls, but thinks Spain is gay?
Then don't miss the Seriously Wicked Bull Run in South Attleboro, Mass!
You and your friends can run from a bunch live bulls, and lots of times, there's a chick whose boob comes out.
Sure. I'll wheel over to the bar and bring back your beers one by one in my lap.
You can't do a bull run with a guy in a wheelchair.
And, uh, I'm supposed to mention that I saw you on LivingSocial?
You know, some people are okay with the drive-through car wash.
I got hit by a car in high school, so I don't have to work.
Maybe we could grab lunch and then see what happens.
I ate nothing and I'm soaking wet for some reason.
So, you guys all pumped to run with the bulls?
You bet, this is gonna be my first exercise since I chased that balloon.
We are competing... in the international Chef Boyardee look-alike contest.
He's in the Cream of Wheat competition, which is down the street.
We didn't want to tell you, but we're going to the Seriously Wicked Bull Run.
We didn't invite you because we didn't think you could keep up.
Yeah, we thought it seemed too dangerous for, uh, incapacitated, half-man, shrivel-legged gimps.
Joe, you peed in your bag while you said that.
Can you honestly say that you didn't pee just now while you were talking?
I-I just need to say that to, you know, to finish.
I think he's bitter because he never got the credit he deserved for killing Osama bin Laden.
As long as he thinks you're our new pet, we can keep fooling around behind his back.
Wow, this could be an even better scam than that claw machine at the arcade.
It's impossible to do anything with a dumb, crappy claw!
If you could angle up the ring, then I could kind of hook it.
They have the type of fat white woman here that not even I am interested in.
Ladies, gentlemen, and alternative high school graduates, get ready to run for your lives!
Cleveland, why do you let them talk you into these things?
Hey, guys, after this, let's beat alligators with sticks or something.
Well, Mr. Swanson, I did an exploratory procedure, which revealed extensive damage.
Mr. Swanson has lost all movement, and will require around-the-clock care.
Well, seems like you folks have this all taken care of.
Check this out-- the way he's sitting, it looks like the dog's watching the news.
Well, I'm off to do what former Navy SEALs do-- sell lawnmowers.
Look at this old Casio keyboard from the 1980s that I have found.
Until you spoke, I did not know we were French!
Now, which wall would you like to look at for the rest of your life?
Look, guys, I don't want to be a burden to anyone.
So before we go, I'm gonna put the remote in your mouth.
And here's a magazine I thought you might like to read.
Joe, I just wish we could do more, but obviously your mouth is full.
And you probably don't want any reminders of Bonnie around the house, so I cleared out all of her underwear.
I don't know, I'm not sure I feel right about leaving Joe.
Doesn't seem like he's gonna be able to take care of himself.
Look, he's already watching The Price Is Right in there.
Okay, you can play over there in the sandbox, honey.
Okay, I'm just gonna walk 30 feet away, and then panic because I can't see you.
I just pretend to be their dog, and then when he leaves for work,
I get to go to the pound, if you know what I mean.
Look, this whole page is all the Wayans brothers sitting in different positions.
How you suppose they come up with all them positions?
I'm honestly just glad it seems like you have something you like.
Oh, come on, I don't want to have to watch this.
I was the only one who didn't get to meet Biden.
I think I'm gonna order some Me Like Bang Ho.
In my day we'd throw him in the army and have him play the bugle.
It's a huge amount of work and we don't have any idea what we're doing.
I just think he'd be better off under the care of grumpy, Filipino nurses.
Yeah, that's why I looked into it, and we've reserved a place for him at the State Home for Mentals and Bastards.
Oh, my God, sometimes they whip them with hoses... outside?! This is perfect!
There's one last thing I got to say to my friend.
Hey, Joe, you know that movie you told me to watch that you said was your favorite movie of all time, and you said I had to watch it?
You know, tha-that state home we left Joe in didn't seem so bad.
Would the French people let their boss walk around in stained underwear trying to stab people if the place wasn't nice?
That's why I'm gonna go stay with my mother in Baltimore and work at her wife's bar.
Well, you remember when the vet knocked you out to take out that rotten tooth?
Heh, I like how you're chained up in a yard and still trying to pretend you're a guy.
Her husband's a maniac and the only reason he hasn't killed me is because he thinks I'm just his pet dog.
Garcia steps off the mound again, virtually guaranteeing that my wife will be asleep when I get home.
The big right-hander kicks a little dirt and tosses the rosin bag as my children grow up without me.
Okay, and now a fan in the stands is giving me the finger.
Hey, I don't know if you can hear it, but I'm peeing in my coffee cup right now.
I got arrested for huckin' a TV/VCR combo off the dam.
Maybe he can put in a word for you down at the police station.
Whenever you offer me a back rub, it means you're hiding something.
We may or may not have put Joe in a smelly home for the goofy.
I believe you found our dog, and we need to take him home.
Well, we figured you'd say no to us, but not to Vice President Joe Biden!
First, I want to thank you, Vic, for shooting the guy we said was Osama bin Laden.
You have to tell us if you're from the news.
Yeah, we just kind of got overwhelmed and all freaked out.
And we'll always be there for you no matter what.
I'd say let's get my stuff, but it's all been stolen.
Sorry, no one gets out of here without a release from their doctor.
Dr. Hartman must have dropped his phone in Joe when he was looking at his spine!
I just thought I was losing my mind from lunatics screaming in my face.
Yeah, it turns out Dr. Hartman's cell phone was pressing on my spinal cord, and that's what was causing my total paralysis.
Yeah, sorry we dropped the ball for a while, which is the way we agreed we'd describe what we did to you, which hopefully makes it seem less heinous.
I know, he spaces out when he's at the computer.
Hey, great idea bringing the couch out here from your den, Peter. Yeah, Lois and I dragged it out here last night for a little hump sesh, so I figured I'd let it dry. Couch. That's one of those words that if you say it over and over it starts to sound silly.
Joe, you need to take a class on small talk.
Good. You could have also responded to Janet, who said her son died.
I'm sorry your son died on such a cloudy day.
Ha-ha! You got to move fast when Meg's at the table, Brian.
All right, well, I get the box when we have pizza for dinner.
Good morning, family. I'll be out front with the guys if anybody needs me.
Peter, I thought we were gonna try to get the garden going again today.
I know, sweetie, but then I realized how stupid that is.
Believe it or not, he used to look like a young Gene Hackman.
Well, somebody probably thought it was trash and took it.
You said you were gonna bring the couch right back in!
What were you thinking? I'll tell you what I was thinking.
Wow, Peter, I think starting a community watch is a great idea.
Hey, listen, Joe, um, you think you can get us all guns?
Besides, you can't just go get a gun, you have to be certified in gun safety, go through an extensive background screening process.
Eh, it was easy-- like pressing that easy button at the office supply store.
Why don't you go ahead and hit the easy button.
All right. Uh... it's kind of too cool for the air-conditioner and too warm for the heater, huh?
There's some weird, big-nose guy hiding in the bushes outside some chick's house. My heart always timidly hides itself behind my mind. I set out to bring down stars from the sky... Ow. Ow. Oh, my God, four men are beating me. My arm. I think it is broken. Who are you guys? Why? Why? I'll give you anything if you would only stop hitting me. Please stop pulling my nose. It is not fake. I think I am dying.
Come to my chamber at once. Come to my chamber at once.
Lois, you wouldn't believe the things we see out there.
There was a kid riding his bike while holding a tennis racket.
For real. Come on! Let's fool around, or watch a movie, or finally click that Crackle icon on the TV.
Lois, I am an unelected vigilante, and I take my job very seriously.
It's a beautiful day-- lots of mischief to get into.
I don't doubt that, but as you can see, I'm pretty busy.
I'm trying to get a head start on my taxes.
Oh, I see-- trying to figure out a way to deduct bananas?
Sometimes I write descriptions of my patients to help me remember them.
So, uh, how's he doing? How's he doing?! How do you think he's doing!
I thought someone was breaking into your house, and I panicked.
It was dark. I-I... I don't know why he didn't just say it was him.
I went to turn it down, and the next thing I know. you shot me!
Why the hell were you climbing in the window of your own house anyway?
My dad says opening the door lets out too much air-conditioning.
You wouldn't have fired that gun if he was white!
I want this racist out the room, and I want him arrested!
Given the circumstances, Peter was within his rights to fire his weapon.
And what about my son's rights not to be shot?!
I'd never want to do anything to hurt you or your family.
I haven't felt this bad since I drove by that speed sign.
I was hoping to apologize and collect his deposit for the community watch shirts. I talked to him earlier.
He, uh, he doesn't want to be anywhere near you.
Good evening. Two nights ago there was a shooting right here in our own backyard.
So that's not really Quahog? It's just a big picture?
Now, Mr. Brown, I understand you're trying to get the police to reopen the investigation.
That's right, Tom. My family and I believe this shooting was a hate crime, and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin held accountable for his actions.
I love blacks, I love Asians... hell, I even love gay Aborigines.
The cashier at the grocery store told her to push on, and then she snapped her fingers, and now I think she's my new favorite lady in the world.
It's well documented that my dream three-way is S. Epatha Merkerson and CCH Pounder.
It is my intention that we conduct this with both sexiness and dignity.
Well, there's got to be something I can do to make things right.
I'll just have to prove to everybody that I'm not a racist.
There's nothing black guys like more than out-of-shape indoor-basketball white guys.
We need to give you a chance, no matter what color your skin is.
Come on, let's play some ball. ...and then Peter and his new friends went for ice cream.
Lois, to show I'm in touch with what it's like to be African-American, I am gonna go to the middle of the town square, get naked and paint myself brown.
And why do you always announce them to me before you do them?
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?
It's never been this bad before. What do we do?
I'm in charge of my head-- that much I know!
Now let's just have a drink and put this all behind us.
Cigars. We can smoke 'em together, all happy, like a bunch of douche bags outside a wedding.
Round up your family and get out or you're all gonna be sorry.
I guess me getting transferred by the Xerox Corporation wasn't the worst thing after all.
Are you here to give me the deposit for the shirts?
No, Peter, I'm here to place you under arrest for the attempted murder of Cleveland Junior.
What are you talkin' about? You know it was an accident.
And the boys upstairs said they can no longer ignore it.
But whoever they are, they're pretty steamed about this whole thing.
I'll send you a cake with a file in it!
These are just the owner manuals for all our kitchen appliances.
Well, guess I finally have time to learn to reset the clock on the coffee maker.
I'd like to talk to you about these charges that have been brought against you.
I, uh, guess I'll see you in a little bit?
How is it that I'm only just now meeting you?
But the media's out there making you look like a monster, all for exercising your constitutional rights.
But don't worry. We're gonna get you out of this.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and let them do this to one of my own.
Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here, set you up with my lawyer, and get these charges dropped.
Don't worry. I'll come up with a good story, and they'll eat it up.
Not like when I read my JAG fan fiction at the NCIS convention. JAG stood up and yelled, 'Objection, Your Honor, by Navy law.' He then turned to the lady lawyer, the gal from the October Maxim, who still managed to be hot despite her sexless, pageboy haircut.
And I was trying to get back into my house, and my neighbor, Mr. Griffin, shot me.
He said he felt threatened by me, and that hurt even worse than getting shot!
You're every bit as sympathetic as this chubby-cheeked cocoa angel.
I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.
Yeah, white paper. Check your jacket pocket. I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.
Hey, look, I'm just saying, it's no surprise that justice isn't colorblind.
Check your other jacket pocket. Hey, look, I'm just saying it's no surprise that justice isn't colorblind.
Oh, God, the bottom of the pocket's been cut out!
Mr. Brown, you testified that you were listening to music at the time of the shooting.
And doesn't he have the lyrics, I put the gun to you. I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up, put ya inside the mattress like drug money?
And isn't true that your last name is the same as Chris Brown's?
Your Honor, I'd like to enter into evidence this photo of a badly beaten Rihanna as well as this print ad for the Entourage movie.
You don't want to go back to jail, do you?
You might see, like, the very top of the crack, but that's-that's not what it's about.
Propped up on pillows, on account of my fat throat.
Carter, I think this has all kind of gone too far.
All those things you heard about Cleveland Jr. were lies.
I swear, it had nothing to do with the color of his skin, but... I did shoot him.
I'm saying that I, Cleveland Brown, a black man, shot Cleveland Brown, Jr., another black man.
Peter, since this is about racism, why don't we take a slow, hands-clasped-behind- the-back walk together?
Listen, I know you wouldn't have shot Cleveland Jr. on account of his race.
And I know you don't have hate in your heart.
You were willing to go to jail for shooting my son.
You ever feel the cool steel of a switchblade pressed against your temple?
His dad-mom sent over some boxes of men's clothes from back before the ol' chippety-choppety.
I'll be on the toilet, wearing a T-shirt that's so long I have to hold it under my chin while I wipe.
Why would anyone get rid of a perfectly good Dickie?
It was a Korean soap opera that I was in.
Yeah, back when the Navy had me stationed in Busan,
I saw an ad in the paper for guys over five-foot-four, and I was the only one who showed up.
Next thing I know, I'm on TV, playing a guy named American Johnny.
They just told me how to sound the words out phonetically.
I did a whole pro-genital-mutilation PSA that I really regret.
Oh, my God, if Hee-Sun and Bong-Hwa don't get together, I'm gonna kill myself!
Wow, I guess he didn't die in the vending machine.
I mean, I haven't been this into something since The Shawshank Redemption.
Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?
All right, Friedrich, now that World War Two is over, we can get back to making comedies again.
Uh... I don't think any of these guys are available.
All right, it's not, but, Quagmire, we need that episode.
Guys, I'm sorry, but it was years ago, and it never aired outside Korea.
Come on, guys, it's just a dumb, forgotten TV show.
All right, gang, me and the guys are off to Korea to find the last episode of a soap opera Quagmire was in.
Hold the phone up to any episode of Who's the Boss?
You know, I've got half a mind to fire you.
Yes, and how many ridiculous things would you like your toilet to do?
But we should probably head out to find the last episode of that Korean soap opera.
Nobody here thinks you look good unless you have big, round eyes and a tiny little nose and chin.
I feel like I want to giggle behind my hand at a lot of things and hold, but not eat, a big ice cream cone.
I heard that American Johnny was back, so I started following you on the new Where American Johnny? app.
Sujin, we actually came here to find the last episode of Winter Summer.
Glenn, you and your friends must come to my home for gross Korean dinner.
We will have many things you will nibble at and not eat.
Hey, can we watch that last episode of Winter Summer now?
In the meantime, feel free to watch Korean pop videos.
What is this, and how can I make the rest of my life about it?
Oh, my God, I can't believe Buttercup is still alive!
Okay, I'm done with this sweet rice water that has a pine nut floating in it.
Of course. Here it is-- the last episode of Winter Summer.
Why would he go back to his sad, pathetic bachelor life in America?!
I'm not gonna make the same mistake American Johnny did.
Find out after this Korean commercial Ashton Kutcher thought no one in America would ever see.
Have you ever killed a dog while driving drunk, and then been upset that there was no way for your car engine to cook it for you on the rest of the drive home?
Well, those days are over, thanks to Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bag.
Just put the dog in the bag, place it over the engine block, and drive your usual over the speed limit.
Dr. Lee's Pet Engine Cooking Bags are not meant for babies.
Plus, commercial pilots around here can just fly their plane into the ocean if they want.
Who am I gonna get all my wiener jokes from?
It's a powerful thing when a woman pays you even the slightest bit of attention.
You guys want to check out Brazil while we're out?
We just got to accept that Quagmire has made his decision.
Yeah, I guess as far as Quagmire's concerned, he's totally Korean now.
Guys, there's only one way to get through to a Korean.
And if you won't listen to us, maybe you'll listen to, um... us.
Your new romance has you lost in an Asian trance
Come on, come on, come on home, Quahog is your home
I know those New York Giants jerseys weren't cheap, but I'm staying here, and that's final.
He is going to live with us, in the Asian tradition.
So will the rest of my aunts, uncles and cousins.
Tomorrow, you take her to town to buy root vegetable.
After that, you will get psychopath haircut so you look like one of us.
Oh, and just so you know, three of my cousins have night terrors.
What I'm trying to say is... guys, I'm coming back to Quahog with you.
But wait, won't that upset Sujin and your new Korean family?
Look, Great-Grandma is so happy, she finally died and became a ghost.
Odd choice to have an open casket for a gunshot suicide.
Yep, I thought I wanted a family, but I love having no responsibilities here.
I can get drunk whenever, sleep with anyone, and just hide in my house and avoid the world if I feel like it.
Wow, that's great, and totally doesn't sound like symptoms of clinical depression.
All right, everyone, it's time to open up our bank statements.
Again, we're very sorry we cyber-bullied that girl to death.
Today, though, please let there be money in our bank account.
We really gotta figure out a better way to budget for this family's future.
Of course, it's already too late for Meg to go to college.
Let's sit down later and see if we can figure out a plan to get our finances in order.
Hey, Peter, I think I figured out one way we can save money for Stewie's college.
If we bundle our cable and Internet together, we can save $14 a month.
Yeah, it combines two of America's greatest resources: garbage and luck.
Ah, you're just saying that because the battery it uses causes bladder cancer.
I shall be at the beach looking for valuables and occasionally using a doorless bathroom.
I gotta start eating breakfast at on-the-sand cafes, where I will judge tourists as my skin browns and hardens.
Stop throwin' your kid's diapers in the trash with all the soda cans!
Hey, Lois, check out what I found with my metal detector.
Yeah, some idiot buried, like, a hundred of 'em in this big lawn under these bone cages.
Hey, guys, like four jeeps just drove up onto our front yard.
Maybe. Or it could be because of my I'm Gonna Barf on the White House blog.
Wonder what happens if I turn it on and point 'em at each other.
Did you also call into a talk show without turning down your radio first?
Peter, did you rob a bunch of people on the beach with your metal detector?
I want you to get rid of that metal detector.
All you're doing is getting into trouble and digging up junk when we really need to be saving for Stewie's college.
Tomorrow we are going to the mall and returning that thing to the store.
But you should know, the day I bought this metal detector was the happiest day of my life.
Now we gonna do this thing a little different tonight
You gonna come over, pick me up in your ride
Oh, my God, I wasn't even supposed to be here.
I passed out at the Tom Petty concert last night and just stayed.
Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really want to do me...
Well, I'm glad the store was willing to take that metal detector back.
I love eating Panda Express while squeezin' our purchases between our knees
We saw an ad looking for a toddler to appear in a peanut butter commercial and we thought we'd bring Susie.
You can get a really good deal on them after prom season.
Hey, Peter, why don't you let me do me, and you do you, okay?
You know, because of that one time you got in the trash and ate a whole jar of recalled peanut butter?
Your face is upside-down, so we're not gonna pick you, but thanks for coming.
Hey. Hey. This is you. I'm Brian. I like garbage peanut butter, and I wear my 'I Voted' sticker for a week and a half.
Oh, he's telling him that he's no longer his favorite son.
Thanks for coming to the viewing party for Stewie's commercial, everybody.
We're sorry that it's airing during 2 Broke Girls, but we have no control over that.
I see you got all dressed up in your exposed wiener.
Well, he likes his hero dad, but he loves Scooter's Peanut Butter.
So good, your baby will want to eat it in an airport terminal bathroom.
We haven't had a celebrity in the family since my great-aunt, Queen of Burlesque Griffin.
Yeah, yeah, but, you know, maybe we should keep a little bit out to celebrate.
I mean, I ain't done nothin' fancy since I bought those rich guy socks.
I mean, we are celebrating our little commercial star and his big payday.
You know, this is a nice dinner and all, but I thought you guys were going to save this commercial money for Stewie's college fund.
The rest of it is going right in the bank.
Yeah, and besides, it's been a while since we ate at a place where if you ask for ketchup, they look at you like you're dirt.
You know, Stewie actually got a call for another commercial tomorrow.
This could be the beginning of a nice career for him.
I mean... I mean, the world of child acting can be a pretty bad environment for a kid.
Maybe we should just let Stewie's childhood be about being a child.
All I'm saying is, just try to keep Stewie's best interests in mind.
Hey, I'm a drug addict and it's midnight-- where's my breakfast?!
Help, he's only gonna eat the toast and put a cigarette out on me.
Okay, Stewie, you booked the last commercial without even trying, so this one should be a piece of cake.
Oh, is your child up for the cough syrup commercial, too?
You'd have no way of knowing this, but the moms tend to dress up.
And you'd have no way of knowing that my son is the Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.
My son had a gun waved in his face in a Dexter episode.
My son got crapped on in the last Jackass movie.
Hi, everybody, we're a little crunched for time, so we're gonna have to audition people right here in the hallway.
That woman just smiled when Stewie banged his balls on the floor.
One of them was texting with the funny-dumb kid from Modern Family.
Holy Christmas, there were a lot of hot moms in yoga pants in there though.
I haven't seen the fat man this upset since he went to the 9/11 museum.
Lois made us do this, but I wanted to go to the Central Park merry-go-round.
Just one question, Stewie-- do you get pleasure out of humiliating your family?
Yeah, is there some kind of sick joy in it?
Stewie has another audition tomorrow, and we're not gonna be embarrassed like we were today.
See, this is the kind of thing I was talking about.
That's why I made this-- I call it 8 Hour Energy.
It's one part 5-Hour Energy, and the other three hours are espresso, Scotts Turf Builder, and a tiny, tiny super-small amount of cocaine.
Peter, you're giving your baby drugs to improve his acting career?
Stewie, if you're fine with it, bleed from the nose.
All right, Stewie, now remember what we practiced last night.
You go in that room and imagine everyone in it wants you sexually.
All right, now I'm gonna go psych out these other kids.
Okay, Stewie, you're just gonna drink this juice, then say, Mmm, and rub your belly.
Stewie booked that orange juice commercial, so we thought we'd make a few upgrades around the house.
I can't make him attack you, Brian, but if I keep printing them, eventually one will go after you.
Look, I-I just don't think any of this is good for Stewie.
Man, this must be what it's like to be Anne Hathaway's parents.
Mom and Dad just, uh, stuck a book on my head and-and left.
And for what? So Peter and Lois can spend the money you earned on crap they don't even need?
Uh, I'm not supposed to use my voice for non-paying stuff, Brian.
Remember? He couldn't even figure out how to use a hotel business center.
Oh, I'm just here to look at other people's e-mails who haven't logged out. And how's business?
Well, I've left some pretty wild replies on a bunch of Evites.
You're the coolest guy I've ever met in one of these things.
I'm just gonna smell it and then throw it in the trash.
If you're gonna continue on this path, you need to know what your future holds.
You remember that kid from A Christmas Story who got his tongue stuck to that pole?
You see, Stewie, there are tons of actors like this.
They all started out just like you, but eventually they were destroyed by their parents' greed, drugs or perverted Hollywood directors.
My God, I had no idea it could be so bad.
Good. Now we just got to make Peter and Lois understand.
Yes, well, if they want to make me into a monster like those people, we'll give 'em a monster.
Okay, Stewie, when Barbara hands you that orange juice, you're gonna drink it and smile.
H-Hold on a second, he's got a smudge on his face.
Let me just take care of that for you guys.
I threw a little Molly in there, too, so we'll go out clubbing afterwards.
As a mom, I want my kids to start their day right.
And there's no better way than with a glass of fresh-squeezed Sunnydale Orange Juice.
I-I can't... I can't go right now with everybody watching.
You don't suppose this has anything to do with the sleep deprivation and narcotics?
It's us-- we're the ones who turned him into this.
I-I guess we just got too caught up in your success and forgot that you're just a baby.
Well, the good news is that now he can go back to being a regular kid.
Well, we went a little crazy there, didn't we, Peter?
But I'm glad we have our normal, very average, non-famous baby back.
No, but you see how easy it is for me to lie to you?
You know, Brian, that acting stuff was a bit much for me, but I did quite enjoy the dancing and the cocaine.
So you're just gonna be a dancer and a drug addict?
For a while. I might crash when I'm 18, but then I'll just turn to the Lord and working out.
I'll-I'll just be a 180 degree different type of insufferable.
I used to need drugs to feel powerful, but now my power comes from my core strength.
The T, of course, stands for the sufferings of the cross.
We now return to the NBA on TNT... on LSD.
Okay, my mom will be here any minute for our spa day. Spa, S-P-A.
And remember, while we're off getting our massages, you and Daddy are gonna spend the day together here.
Look, I'm sorry, but my mom said he can't be left alone at home anymore.
Last time, he went crazy and moved all the furniture around.
Oh, I always forget you walk right into the living room in your house.
Man, spending a whole day with him is gonna be worse than eating at a ball park.
Uh, I'll take one terrible beer, filled up way too high, so I spill most of it, and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun.
Yeah, it's right there between the entrance and the exit to the bathroom.
Perfect. And can I get a bag of unsalted peanuts?
You know, something I would never eat anywhere else in the world?
I can't wait to have diarrhea in the stall with no door while 20 guys wait for me to finish.
Stewie, I can't take any more of Meg and her gross friends.
I'm just finishing up an e-mail to Delta. I have never not screamed at the top of my lungs during air pressure changes, and I do not intend to stop now.
Well, not everybody can be as fascinating as you, Brian.
Can you give me and my friends a ride to field hockey practice?
Uh, I'm kind of helping Stewie with an e-mail to Delta.
There's like tons and tons of videos of people doing it on there.
You want to see a guy in a human-sized hamster ball roll off a mountain?
All he needs is a hundred grand to pay legal fees, and then as soon as he gets his money, I get a million bucks.
'cause there was, like, a bazillion typos in that e-mail.
I mean, can you imagine if you make a million bucks?
You'll be happier than the guy on his wedding day.
Yeah, and thanks for the lecture on what real music is, Mr. Griffin.
Geez, how many Snickers could they eat in a five-minute car ride?
God, it would've been real easy to bring a gun in here.
This is a bigger surprise than when I found out
Oh, it was fine, though I don't know why they made us face each other during the mother-daughter bikini wax.
Carter sent $100,000 to a Nigerian prince who's gonna give him a million.
Oh, Peter, don't tell me you two fell for that scam.
Isn't he in that Showtime thing with the blood and the hats?
Well, come on, Mom, the man was very specific that we need to go put lotion on each other.
I am going to Africa and getting my money back.
I've been working here for 50 years, pretending I'm a woman.
We now return to Kevin James Got Too Fat To Be In Movies.
Kevin James, why'd you have to come back to television?
Okay, time to go to Africa and get my money back.
Oh, just so you know, I didn't tell Lois where we're going, and I couldn't be touched until I was two.
Uh, Carter and I are going away for the next week or so.
Hey, so, uh, what kind of movies do you and your friends like?
Oh, she loves anything where a teenage girl is sick and dies of cancer.
Well, okay, Miss Chatterbox, you better get off to school.
You want her even more than I wanted the new iPhone.
You know, they say there's some animal species here that haven't even been discovered yet.
That African warlord is brutalizing those innocent people. Yeah, but it's okay, because he's wearing a large cowboy hat and follows everything with hamburger, like that stand-up comic from the '90s.
We are going to force all these young boys to be child soldiers.
After 18 hours in the mines, we are going to check your butts for diamonds.
I actually made one too many Build-a-Bears for the cancer kids.
I've got $7.50 left on my Panda Express card if you want to split a three-item combo.
Meg, I am not even going to dignify that with a mall erection.
All right, let's find our prince and get my money back.
Okay, hold on. Shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I answer this call.
Yes, I did call you about the eight-piece lawn croquet set.
Yeah, go ahead and send me a pic, that'd be very helpful.
Sir, shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I look at these pictures.
I'm getting my money back if it's the last thing I do.
I'm Carter Pewterschmidt, and I'm here because you stole my money!
It is with the money that you sent that we have been able to make many wonderful improvements to our village.
I'm Griff, by the way, that's what everybody calls me.
It was your money that paid for the school, a well to provide clean drinking water, our first health clinic, and a Redbox with one movie in it.
Which I, personally, could begin watching at any point in the film and enjoy from there.
Oh, yeah, that's how I feel about that video of Kelsey Grammer fallin' off the stage.
No. You see, no one will actually give money to Africa unless they are tricked into it.
So again, we thank you for your generosity, Father Pewterschmidt.
Nobody steals from Carter Pewterschmidt and gets away with it!
We're going to see a movie called Brittany Finds a Lump.
Feel free to use the seat warmer, keep that box hot.
Geez, I can't believe you're going through with this, Carter.
Paying these thugs to tear down the village isn't gonna bring your money back.
You don't want to be the first white guy to do something bad to Africa.
I'm supposed to go lion shooting with a scumbag dentist.
Oh, my God, they're even taking down the mosquito netting.
I won't stand by and let you further ruin this terrible place!
I have no choice but to write a memoir of my struggles. Chapter One: Harry Potter's aunt and uncle were super mean. 'Spank me harder,' the lady says to Fifty Shades of Grey. 'That's Mr. Fifty Shades of Grey to you, Kate from Ben and Kate.' And then he turned her butt inside out.
Because, sexy. 'Isn't that special,' said the Church Lady, before reporting for her botched surgery. Anyway, I'm here in a prison against my will, and I should be free.
But, in other news, domestic abuse enthusiast Paul Simon has released a new song inspired by a memoir written by Quahog's own Peter Griffin, who has been falsely imprisoned by his father-in-law in an African jail.
I bet there's not one word about you in that book.
Hey, I wonder if any of those stars are wishing on us, huh?
Most guys never give me the time of day because I'm so plain-looking.
Speaking of which, why don't we get rid of that big old thing?
But... you're always saying dumpy girls like us only have each other.
I was just saying that because I was worried you'd become popular and not want to be friends with us anymore.
Meg, I'm $18 into this evening, so can you maybe just get out of here?
Even at the speed of light, mean-spirited thoughts from the stars can take thousands or even millions of years to reach the Earth.
Now wait, let me get this straight: none of you guys has ever heard of Bono?
Whatever you do, don't tell them you have a clitoris.
Look, I'm sorry you got swindled, but you can't treat people this way.
And give these people back their health clinic and their school.
Lois, how much was your flight and which card did you put it on?
I mean, you've always been grouchy, but why are you being so mean-spirited?
For God's sake, I can't even be left alone in my own house for an afternoon.
You have to drop me off at your house so this fat idiot can babysit me!
I realize growing old is no fun, but this is no way to act.
And I'm sorry for what I did to your village, Dave.
Listen, when I get home, I'll transfer enough money so you can rebuild your town.
And second of all, this is 100% not Billy Joel!
You know, when they recorded Movin' Out, someone left the studio doors open, and that's why, at the end, you hear that car sound.
You know, to live with Mr. Cacciatore down on Mulberry Street.
Peter, I'm gonna punch you with this beer mug till I'm holding just the handle!
They're little programs you use on your phone while driving.
Like the guy who invented wearing a sport jacket with jeans.
Well, I've got to go to church, but I don't have time to change from the rodeo.
Excuse me, I thought you were helping me find a look that'll let me cling to my youth in my 40s.
Yes, I'm interested in cheating on my wife in Las Vegas.
Gentlemen, I think I can help all three of you.
Joanne was supposed to drive me to the club, but she's having throat surgery. menthol slims.
You know, I do have a life outside this house.
For example, I also write restaurant reviews for the newspaper under the name Hugh Cornwallis.
No, I might also hit the treadmill and watch Kelly and Michael on mute with closed captioning.
It's like kale is everywhere these days, am I right? unintelligible.
Well, I just found out about these things called apps, so that's kind of all I do now.
Where have you been? I haven't seen you in days.
Ugh. I went out of town for a little while, but I made the mistake of using this app called Bear B'n'B.
Just a reminder, we ask that you not use the DVD player, but you can watch any of the VHSs.
Son of the Mask... oh, and here's most of a puzzle.
Fine. Well, if the phone rings and we're not around, just take a message.
Oh, and just a heads up, the dog doesn't like men.
The house specialty is a half-chewed trout we yanked out of the river with our teeth.
Oh, I'm meeting up with someone from my Grinder app.
No, no, no. This one's a way for guys who enjoy sandwiches to connect.
It's probably because of all those apps you've been downloading.
If you put it in a bag of uncooked rice, it'll dry out.
Yeah. And then you can use the rice to pretend someone wanted to marry you.
She bought feminine products at my dad's pharmacy, so you know she's up and running.
Yeah, I wish I had the guts to talk to her.
If you want to get a girl's attention, you text her a picture of your penis.
People who send their daughters to public high schools are basically asking for this.
Well, I did just get this new phone from my dad.
Where frail old men come to weigh themselves in the nude.
Wow, they allow drinking here at 10:30 in the morning?
Oh, yes, half the bathroom trash is thrown-up scrambled eggs.
Okay, so this place has hot women, morning booze and free vomit?
What are you talking about? I'm a great tennis player.
There's a doubles tournament coming up, and I could really use a partner.
All right, all right, I suppose we can make this work.
Like that actress from Rizzoli & Isles and her husband do.
Honey, I thought we could do a little role-playing tonight.
Hey, look, you didn't marry me because of my brains.
You married me because I play one of the main bad guys in Blue Bloods.
Now let's just stop talking and have idiot actor sex.
We've got a bit of a situation, which is why I've asked Officer Swanson to join us.
It appears Chris sent an inappropriate photo of himself to one of his classmates.
And apparently the girl... Oh, thank God. ...he sent it to doesn't like him back, so she turned him in.
Okay, I can see everybody's mad, but... what'd you think?
Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Principal Shepherd.
When Chris sent that picture, he was technically distributing child pornography.
I don't know what to say, but the laws just haven't caught up to how cool kids are now.
Well, I'm not about to make a Batman exit right now, but has that thing always been over there?
Today, we bring you a disturbing case of child pornography.
Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin, whose name will be omitted here, was caught sending, quote-unquote, graphic selfies of his hog-- not sure where that quote is from-- to another underage student.
Coming up next, teleprompter guy puts the period in a weird.
When I was your age, boys used to just whip it out on the bus.
Can't I just go on the news and tell everyone I'm sorry?
Oh, I wish you could, sweetie, but the law says that, as a sex offender, you have to complete a rehabilitation course.
Eh, can't be any worse than our trip to Hawaii.
I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork, rum, macadamia nuts, stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf, sentimental military stuff, lava, people who I can't tell are black or Asian, apostrophes, anyone twirling flames, second weddings and linen pants.
All of you are sex offenders, and statistically you will all be here again.
Because this has never worked in the history of doing this.
Now, today, we have a new member-- giggity-- Chris G.
All right, before we begin, whoever's driving a windowless van painted like an ice cream truck, your lights are on.
Okay, next, let's take a few minutes to talk about our new, fake interests.
What's that? You take a ton of pills that completely wipe out all sexuality.
And, uh, your testicle's hanging out of your shorts again.
I don't know. He was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago.
So, anyway, my ex said, If you bring home one more tennis trophy,
Stewie, relax. I promise we'll practice, but we just ordered bisque.
Well, if you must know, we're putting it on Philippa's husband's account.
Now, come on, let's have more hard liquor and creamy soups.
I can't believe we're having an ice cream cake to celebrate Chris graduating from sex offender school.
Well, the opportunities to celebrate don't come often in this household.
You can go back to being a normal boy and put all this behind you.
I had 'em put on your cake. Happy sixth birthday, Timmy?
Uh-oh, they must have mixed them up. Nice crank, you dirty little bastard?
Here's your cake. I ate a great deal of it.
Yeah, nothing like running around after eating a seafood tower.
I entered us in that tournament because you said you could play!
And I will not be humiliated in front of shallow, rich alcoholics!
I see you walked across the grass again instead of using the walk.
Mr. Quagmire, I completed that sex rehab and I paid my debt to society, but people are still afraid of me, like I'm some kind of creep.
How do I get them to treat me the way they did before all this happened?
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris, but you're just gonna have to accept that from now on, people are gonna see you as a sex-crazed pervert.
Now nobody will have any reason to be afraid of me or think I'm a pervert, and everybody can just treat me like normal again.
Oh, my God, I can't believe my son's some kind of weirdo!
Look, Chris, I know you think chemical castration is gonna solve your problems, but you have to stop taking those pills.
I don't have to do anything, besides get to the wind chime store before it closes.
To be fair, they also have a couple of kaleidoscopes.
Lois, can I go to the store with that thing?
Wow, we rolled three gutter balls on these kids, huh?
Thanks. You know, I just pretend that tennis ball is Mitch McConnell trying to roll back subsidies on the Affordable Care Act, and I'm like, Nope!
Yeah, I-I don't... I don't need to hear your process.
And I already know exactly where I'm gonna put that trophy.
Chris, your mother and I want you to stop taking them pills.
There's a lot of great things about having a sex drive that you're missing out on. Like what?
If you liked my wife's snizz, you're gonna love her ambrosia.
I was thinking about this seven-layer dip the whole time I was chowing Ronald.
I just don't think Chris is gonna change his mind.
It's only a matter of time before he shaves one side of his head and swoops the rest of the hair over.
With all the free time, I'm no longer devoting to onanism...
That's spanking it? Yes, Peter. ...I have managed to redirect that energy into my studies.
In fact, today I received the Kaplan Prize in biology.
Not only that, I got the highest score on my Spanish test, and I even joined the debate team.
All right, well, I'm gonna put some flowers in a wagon and walk around town.
Not thinking about sex all the time seems to have allowed Chris to excel in other areas.
Heck, the old Chris couldn't even figure out the self-checkout at the supermarket.
All right, Brian, we win this set, the tournament's ours.
I can already see our names in the newsletter, right below the deaths from the previous quarter.
You're gonna penalize us because you're a blind blue jacket?!
I will drop you to your knees and shove my racket so far down your throat you'll be my grip for a week!
Maybe I'll see you later when you don't have that name tag on.
So to find the area of this circle, we're going to need to use pi, whose digits go on forever.
I had no idea you were such an amazing tutor.
Thanks, but why are you being so nice to me?
Yeah, he took my phone to look at pictures of my friends, and he found the one you sent.
Well, I hope you know that's not who I am anymore.
I do, and I hope I didn't cause you too much trouble.
Well, Chris, you killed that librarian, but we're glad to have you back to your old self.
Well, at least she saw a little Wang before taking that dirt nap.
Hey, you guys, you know that song Jimmy Crack Corn?
Yeah, it's me and Lois' wedding song-- what about it?
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.
Black guys put hot sauce on everything, on account of most of us been pepper-sprayed by the time we're two.
Can't taste nothing unless you got that burn on there.
I feel like I'm crying, but, like, out of my neck and back.
He looks like Oliver Platt climbing a flight of stairs.
I'll give you ten bucks if you drink an entire shot glass of that hot sauce.
I can get people to pay me ten bucks just for doing stupid stuff?
Man, I haven't made money this easy since I invented the Yanket!
Well, I want to masturbate, but I'm just so darn cold.
If you're anything like me, the number one problem in your life is that you can't masturbate just anywhere.
Introducing the Yanket, the only blanket with built-in decoy arms.
Our patented process makes it look like you're... holding the remote or sipping a beer.
Meanwhile, your real hands are under the blanket, going to town.
I got one. I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.
So, uh, I guess this means Peter, you're our Joe now, and Joe, you're our Peter.
That means you got to do anything for ten bucks.
Hey, Peter, I just thought of something else you could do for ten bucks.
I... I'm, uh, think I'm gonna, um, upping my price to $12.50.
All right, we're gonna open this fire hydrant and you're gonna drink as much water from it as you can.
Your body and mind are supposed to be on the same team.
Sitting on the hard floor's good for your back, too.
Coming up: female high school teacher sleeps with her students.
But first, the public library suffered damage this evening when an area fat man smashed through the front of the building while attempting a drunken stunt.
The bus station is expected to absorb the overflow of homeless armpit-washing ladies.
In light of events at the library, we now go live to a press conference at the mayor's residence.
Anyway, these types of immature, drunken high jinks are destroying our town.
And if we can't trust a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly, then I have no choice but to take action.
I hereby raise the town's legal drinking age to 50.
It's day three of Quahog's new ban on alcohol for anybody under 50.
And if there's one thing the new drinking age law has done, it's let us know that women tell terrible stories.
For more on this story, we now go to Tricia Takanawa.
Joyce, I'm standing here on the streets of Quahog, where citizens are feeling the effects of the city's new drinking law.
I was going to bone my girlfriend, but she told me that if there wasn't vanilla vodka involved, there was no way.
I think we just have to trust our elected officials... and Goldman's Pharmacy is fully stocked on cough syrup, which goes great with ginger ale.
Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I'm actually thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.
Oh, my God, he's just been drunk this whole time?
And I got to say, it was kind of uncool of Mayor West to call it Peter's Law.
I... I don't... I don't think you know how she felt.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before, guys.
We'll just go into the brewery after hours and take some beer.
Oh, you know... you know, I just remembered, there's no beer here, l-let's- let's just, let's just go.
Peter, why'd you want me to get us into this prison?
Because, Joe, everyone knows that all prisoners make bootleg wine in their toilet.
The man who made it, Curtis Murder Dog Williams, went on to become one of America's most celebrated vintners.
If we can't buy alcohol in Quahog, we'll just go to the next town over.
Sorry, in this town, you can only buy alcohol if you're dressed head-to-toe in jeans.
Have you seen some of these laws they've got now about denim?
You know, I say, if you don't like it, you may as well Levi's.
I tell you, guys, getting alcohol when you're underage isn't as easy as Obama's daughters make it look.
Hey, what's up? We going for a ride in the car?!
Don't ever do that unless you have a car ride to offer.
I'll thank you not to check out my pubic hair.
'Cause just sitting here all sober is more boring than watching a pot boil.
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell
How would you like to build, build a deck right now with your buddy?
I'll just pull my car around and point the headlights at it.
Did you know that my dad once called me a mistake?
You know, Brian, hanging out with you this past week has been awesome.
Yeah, why don't we, why don't we do this anymore?
We-we-we used to do fun stuff all the time, you know?
All right, I'm gonna go barf down the garbage disposal.
Brian, I think we can get John Mayer to stop tweeting again, but we all got to work together.
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging out with my main man, Peter. Main man? Hanging out?
It hasn't dawned on you that he only started spending time with you when the drinking age was raised?
Trust me, as soon as you're no longer of use to him, he'll be done with you.
I got to go tell him This isn't a game, man.
Brian, do you have any idea why Peter was trying to climb in the dishwasher?
I guess we had a little too much to drink. To drink?!
Was, was he in here? I... I smell his cologne.
Peter, we-- maybe we should find some place else to get-- to drink.
Somebody here with a 2,400-baud modem almost started World War III.
Hey, you want to see me run up that slide?
Yeah, no, I-I know. That's, that's, that's what I thought.
I know Lois gets mad about it, but I like using them to point at things.
All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on, so I'm gonna go bite at the water a little bit.
I meant prior to me coming up and investigating this.
Somebody's been buying it for me and all my friends!
Well, you better tell me who that is or you're in a lot of trouble.
Nah, I'm just gonna stay here until the sun comes up and then be the best at tetherball.
I bought some alcohol for someone I thought was my friend.
I threw a bottle of rum through the window of the Apple Store.
Sometimes they let you take the good trash home if you ask nice.
It obviously wasn't for me, but the imagination's a hell of a thing.
Me and the guys were hoping you could buy us some more beer.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a half a can of hot beer left in this open container I've been driving around with.
Well, I'm not the smartest man in the world, but I can always look back on my life and say I went for it.
Ugh, this seems like a weird place to even use a condom.
Just shut up, Peter. I'm done with you, all right?
You completely lied about why you were hanging out with me.
And besides, I'm sick of you acting like you're such a victim.
Hey, can one of you guys with elbows try to get this truck to honk?
Ah, that and giving noogies is what I miss most about having elbows.
I mean, if it weren't for that, we never would've been in this fight.
I bet if we worked together we could find a way to change it back.
Come on, I know it seems hard, but we can't just give up.
I was about to say that, because I invented it!
Okay, Peter, I know how we can get the law changed.
I've been doing some research, and it says here that in eight months, we can get a non-binding proposition on the ballot as long as we get 4,000 signatures.
Ah, screw that, we're going with plan B-- threaten to kill the mayor's nephew.
And everybody knows the best way to get any law struck down is to get the gays angry about it.
Crap. But come on, you got to change that law!
I mean, it's already ruined a friendship with one of the best guys I know!
I guess I'll just have to resign in scandal while leaving the law intact.
Look, don't you understand what drinking means to us working stiffs?
It helps us forget about our day and tell our children we love 'em with a straight face.
It allows gross uggos to boof each other's gross uggo parts.
And it gives people the courage to sneak onto their mayor's property and blackmail him and eat all his ripe tomatoes.
Ah, then could you point me to the closest nighttime dentist?
So listen, Mr. Mayor, what do you say about that law?
But only if you send me and Carol a copy of that picture.
We don't have a lot of the two of us together.
Brian, we did it! We got him to change the law!
Just goes to show, if anybody wants a law changed, they should just go to their mayor's house.
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate what you said there about our friendship.
Well, to be honest, Brian, at first I did just want you to buy us beer.
I-I remembered how much fun we used to have together.
Hey, on your way out, could you put this in my mailbox for the mailman?
Well, Peter, I'm just happy that you and Brian managed to get that law repealed, and that you're finally friends again.
Hey, you guys, you know that song Jimmy Crack Corn?
Yeah, it's me and Lois' wedding song-- what about it?
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.
Black guys put hot sauce on everything, on account of most of us been pepper-sprayed by the time we're two.
Can't taste nothing unless you got that burn on there.
I feel like I'm crying, but, like, out of my neck and back.
He looks like Oliver Platt climbing a flight of stairs.
I'll give you ten bucks if you drink an entire shot glass of that hot sauce.
I can get people to pay me ten bucks just for doing stupid stuff?
Man, I haven't made money this easy since I invented the Yanket!
Well, I want to masturbate, but I'm just so darn cold.
If you're anything like me, the number one problem in your life is that you can't masturbate just anywhere.
Introducing the Yanket, the only blanket with built-in decoy arms.
Our patented process makes it look like you're... holding the remote or sipping a beer.
Meanwhile, your real hands are under the blanket, going to town.
I got one. I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.
So, uh, I guess this means Peter, you're our Joe now, and Joe, you're our Peter.
That means you got to do anything for ten bucks.
Hey, Peter, I just thought of something else you could do for ten bucks.
I... I'm, uh, think I'm gonna, um, upping my price to $12.50.
All right, we're gonna open this fire hydrant and you're gonna drink as much water from it as you can.
Your body and mind are supposed to be on the same team.
Sitting on the hard floor's good for your back, too.
Coming up: female high school teacher sleeps with her students.
But first, the public library suffered damage this evening when an area fat man smashed through the front of the building while attempting a drunken stunt.
The bus station is expected to absorb the overflow of homeless armpit-washing ladies.
In light of events at the library, we now go live to a press conference at the mayor's residence.
Anyway, these types of immature, drunken high jinks are destroying our town.
And if we can't trust a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly, then I have no choice but to take action.
I hereby raise the town's legal drinking age to 50.
It's day three of Quahog's new ban on alcohol for anybody under 50.
And if there's one thing the new drinking age law has done, it's let us know that women tell terrible stories.
For more on this story, we now go to Tricia Takanawa.
Joyce, I'm standing here on the streets of Quahog, where citizens are feeling the effects of the city's new drinking law.
I was going to bone my girlfriend, but she told me that if there wasn't vanilla vodka involved, there was no way.
I think we just have to trust our elected officials... and Goldman's Pharmacy is fully stocked on cough syrup, which goes great with ginger ale.
Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I'm actually thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.
Oh, my God, he's just been drunk this whole time?
And I got to say, it was kind of uncool of Mayor West to call it Peter's Law.
I... I don't... I don't think you know how she felt.
I don't know why I didn't think of this before, guys.
We'll just go into the brewery after hours and take some beer.
Oh, you know... you know, I just remembered, there's no beer here, l-let's- let's just, let's just go.
Peter, why'd you want me to get us into this prison?
Because, Joe, everyone knows that all prisoners make bootleg wine in their toilet.
The man who made it, Curtis Murder Dog Williams, went on to become one of America's most celebrated vintners.
If we can't buy alcohol in Quahog, we'll just go to the next town over.
Sorry, in this town, you can only buy alcohol if you're dressed head-to-toe in jeans.
Have you seen some of these laws they've got now about denim?
You know, I say, if you don't like it, you may as well Levi's.
I tell you, guys, getting alcohol when you're underage isn't as easy as Obama's daughters make it look.
Hey, what's up? We going for a ride in the car?!
Don't ever do that unless you have a car ride to offer.
I'll thank you not to check out my pubic hair.
'Cause just sitting here all sober is more boring than watching a pot boil.
You put your left leg down, your right leg up
I got a castle in Brooklyn, that's where I dwell
How would you like to build, build a deck right now with your buddy?
I'll just pull my car around and point the headlights at it.
Did you know that my dad once called me a mistake?
You know, Brian, hanging out with you this past week has been awesome.
Yeah, why don't we, why don't we do this anymore?
We-we-we used to do fun stuff all the time, you know?
All right, I'm gonna go barf down the garbage disposal.
Brian, I think we can get John Mayer to stop tweeting again, but we all got to work together.
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging out with my main man, Peter. Main man? Hanging out?
It hasn't dawned on you that he only started spending time with you when the drinking age was raised?
Trust me, as soon as you're no longer of use to him, he'll be done with you.
I got to go tell him This isn't a game, man.
Brian, do you have any idea why Peter was trying to climb in the dishwasher?
I guess we had a little too much to drink. To drink?!
Was, was he in here? I... I smell his cologne.
Peter, we-- maybe we should find some place else to get-- to drink.
Somebody here with a 2,400-baud modem almost started World War III.
Hey, you want to see me run up that slide?
Yeah, no, I-I know. That's, that's, that's what I thought.
I know Lois gets mad about it, but I like using them to point at things.
All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on, so I'm gonna go bite at the water a little bit.
I meant prior to me coming up and investigating this.
Somebody's been buying it for me and all my friends!
Well, you better tell me who that is or you're in a lot of trouble.
Nah, I'm just gonna stay here until the sun comes up and then be the best at tetherball.
I bought some alcohol for someone I thought was my friend.
I threw a bottle of rum through the window of the Apple Store.
Sometimes they let you take the good trash home if you ask nice.
It obviously wasn't for me, but the imagination's a hell of a thing.
Me and the guys were hoping you could buy us some more beer.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a half a can of hot beer left in this open container I've been driving around with.
Well, I'm not the smartest man in the world, but I can always look back on my life and say I went for it.
Ugh, this seems like a weird place to even use a condom.
Just shut up, Peter. I'm done with you, all right?
You completely lied about why you were hanging out with me.
And besides, I'm sick of you acting like you're such a victim.
Hey, can one of you guys with elbows try to get this truck to honk?
Ah, that and giving noogies is what I miss most about having elbows.
I mean, if it weren't for that, we never would've been in this fight.
I bet if we worked together we could find a way to change it back.
Come on, I know it seems hard, but we can't just give up.
I was about to say that, because I invented it!
Okay, Peter, I know how we can get the law changed.
I've been doing some research, and it says here that in eight months, we can get a non-binding proposition on the ballot as long as we get 4,000 signatures.
Ah, screw that, we're going with plan B-- threaten to kill the mayor's nephew.
And everybody knows the best way to get any law struck down is to get the gays angry about it.
Crap. But come on, you got to change that law!
I mean, it's already ruined a friendship with one of the best guys I know!
I guess I'll just have to resign in scandal while leaving the law intact.
Look, don't you understand what drinking means to us working stiffs?
It helps us forget about our day and tell our children we love 'em with a straight face.
It allows gross uggos to boof each other's gross uggo parts.
And it gives people the courage to sneak onto their mayor's property and blackmail him and eat all his ripe tomatoes.
Ah, then could you point me to the closest nighttime dentist?
So listen, Mr. Mayor, what do you say about that law?
But only if you send me and Carol a copy of that picture.
We don't have a lot of the two of us together.
Brian, we did it! We got him to change the law!
Just goes to show, if anybody wants a law changed, they should just go to their mayor's house.
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate what you said there about our friendship.
Well, to be honest, Brian, at first I did just want you to buy us beer.
I-I remembered how much fun we used to have together.
Hey, on your way out, could you put this in my mailbox for the mailman?
Well, Peter, I'm just happy that you and Brian managed to get that law repealed, and that you're finally friends again.
You could put a Breathalyzer up to that photo and she'd get a DUI.
Thank you all so much for coming this evening to my very fancy dinner party.
Well, thank you. And you're the prettiest of all the women I know whose name is Glenn.
Everyone, please finish your salads, because our main course tonight is... boiled rabbit.
It seems weird that I'd have a joke in my own dream that I don't get. Oh, thank you so...
I had a bad dream, so now your night has to be terrible.
And I got a big day tomorrow. I got two shows.
Like, how does that candle in Beauty and the Beast sing so good? I mean, the teapot I get,
'cause she's a girl. But the candle, I don't under...
I just had sex with a girl on her period!
Oh, hey, Brian. Stewie kind of took over our bed, so I'm looking for a place to sleep.
I was in jail 'cause I killed a bunch of old ladies.
And now that I'm out, I'm gonna do it again.
Yeah, 'cause I was up super late last night, beefing your mom.
Whoa, what's your problem? Why are you being such a jerk?
I thought nightmare meant, like, being invited to an apartment party.
Get a house if you want to have a party.
Oh, no, Brian. I am not living through that horror again.
I don't know. Maybe I'll get a job working the night shift at a supermarket.
Yeah, right, it's 2:00 a.m. You're not here for vegetables.
Oh, hey, Lois. Welcome to the Pete Pad, where the dancing's hot, the drinks are hot...
So I dragged up some stuff and turned it into a sweet hangout.
Even made it extra awesome by stealing a real street sign.
I don't understand. What are you gonna do up here?
Eh, mostly just burn the roof of my mouth on unevenly-heated microwave burritos.
Now I'm busy, so close the floor and get out of here.
I'll watch that preview channel that always has inconsistent volumes.
I was just sitting here on the couch and I had another nightmare about that horrible monster.
And maybe I can help you control your strange obsession with eating pencil erasers.
The world is small and safe when I do this!
Okay, Stewie, I read the review of a dream book on Amazon, so I think I can help you.
Anyway, it says here that most nightmares are born of subconscious fears.
So maybe if we make a list of the things you're most afraid of, we can face and conquer these fears together, and then your nightmares'll end.
Somebody who works five days a week at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
Hey, I brought construction paper and markers in case you guys want to draw breasts.
Cool. But before that, who's up for another insulation fight?
Peter Doesn't Have to Take Out the Trash coupon that I got for my anniversary.
Joe... you hit a home run with that, I want to try it.
Because here comes Chris walking in the door right now.
Are you guys playing lawn darts in the attic again?
Oh, yeah, we put Joe in Stewie's old Jolly Jumper.
That's it. This is our home, not some frat house for you and your friends.
Well, that's what I said, but then he did it, and I was like, Oh, all right, okay, yeah, kind of.
So, how'd it go last night? Did we cure your nightmares?
You see, once connected to this device, you will be able to enter my sleeping mind, where you will end these horrible dreams once and for all.
We just can't understand him because of the way he talks.
Oh, no, no, I think he just needs a ride home.
You and I will place these cranial impulse receptor caps on our heads, I shall begin my slumber, and...
And then this thing will actually allow me to enter your dream?
I want you to come inside me while I'm asleep.
And once you're in my dream, your job is to stop these nightmares by finding that monster and killing him.
When you get in there, you've got to be hard.
I found it at the crosswalk where those kids got creamed the other day.
Yes, I know. You were very mean in 101 Dalmations.
Thank you. Would you like to do the Bristol Stomp?
I can't believe she left us up here all night.
Maybe if we just scream for help someone'll hear us.
B, run downhill, or C, stand your ground? ...and just because of the roles I play, people always assume I'm very serious in real life.
Stewie, hey! I'm here to find and kill the monster that's been causing all your nightmares.
Hey, you know, that Glenn Close salad actually wasn't bad.
Yeah, a lot of my dreams have pretty good salad.
Scary people yelling in another part of the world, adult stuff.
I wish Mom wouldn't watch the news in front of me!
Aah! That one trip to the petting zoo really messed me up!
I would've been here sooner, but one of my legs is a snake that's very hungry for mice.
Maybe this means that deep down, the thing I'm most afraid of is disappointing you.
Me? Wh-Why do you care so much about what I think?
You've been more of a father figure to me than the fat man ever has been or ever will be.
Look, I know I'm always busting your balls, but it's just because you're the only person in this house whose judgment actually matters to me.
But listen, you-you never have to worry about letting me down.
I mean, you're only a baby, and yet, you're one of the most amazing people I know.
Oh, yeah, no, that one stays locked until the overnight to Vegas with my college a cappella group.
Lois, so help me God, if you don't let us out right this second,
Don't test me. I'll do it! We'll all do it!
If it'll get us out of here, I'll make a doodie on it.
That's good! Puke on the dress! Puke on the dress!
I-I don't know if it got on the dress or not, Lois, but I-I am... I am so sorry.
Let's just agree that we both went a bit too far, hmm?
Sure did. Turned out that monster was nothing more than a manifestation of your subconscious desire not to disappoint me.
Stewie, I want you to know... I'm very proud of you.
You are a good person. Stop complimenting me. Oh, I sure hope the dog approves of who I am.
You could put a Breathalyzer up to that photo and she'd get a DUI.
Thank you all so much for coming this evening to my very fancy dinner party.

Stewie, I want you to know... I'm very proud of you.
You are a good person. Stop complimenting me. Oh, I sure hope the dog approves of who I am.
Here, we brought you guys an orchid from Trader Joe's, because we don't know or care about any of your interests.
Well, let's break for presents, but after that, I'll show you Susie's birth video, and I'll tell you, she fell out of there like an orange out of an old dress sock.
Ugh, I have to text Rupert what a train wreck this is.
Kind of weird they're keeping all our jackets in the tub.
I told you, Joe, when we're alone, you can call me Bonald.
I wanted to do with my life, but now, I'm 46, and all I've ever done is take care of Joe.
And now you feel like you never had a chance to be your true self.
I mean, I'm happy that Peter found me and gave me a home, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier on my own.
No, I was going to say, like the Von Trapps.
Um... I better go downstairs before Joe realizes I'm gone.
And before Peter gets into the stuff that's not for the party.
Ah, I can't believe I just kissed my friend's wife.
I heard that there was a Romulan ship spotted in our sector, which means...
Kids, this morning, Principal Shepherd wanted to say a few words.
Uh, before I start, are these the normal kids or kind of the dur, dur ones?
It's that time of the year again to fulfill your community service requirement by signing up for volunteer work.
The jobs will be assigned randomly but the cooler and prettier students have the better jobs.
For instance, blonde chick in the third row will wash my car this afternoon while, Little Miss Frumpkin with all the questions, will work in an old folks' home.
So let's just do two or three high-fives and then forget it ever happened.
Well, except for that one time you discovered my hidden shame.
She says she's a girl, but she certainly has a boy's body odor.
Yeah, I figured it was the least we could do, since you pulled up a beheading video on your phone at their party and showed it to everyone.
It was really more about how loud my phone can get.
But the Operation game is out of batteries, so I'll have to make the noise.
Look, the other night was great, but it was a mistake.
Yeah, I me... I mean, there's... there's definitely some kind of connection between us, but...
I felt it, too, but maybe in another life, huh?
Okay, here we go, uh, uh, crippled guy... uh, cheating wife... uh, uh, cheating wife of a crippled guy...
Uh, dog... some... something with a dog... uh, dog kiss.
Oh, sounds like, uh, sounds like dog kisses crippled guy's wife at your party.
Can you even imagine a woman who possibly does that for real?
Huh. Well, maybe your car violated some sort of unspoken boundary.
One that nobody bothers to codify because it's just common decency.
Well, I hope your day gets better, Brian, but, uh, I wouldn't count on it.
Boy, it wasn't easy Mrs. Parkhurst, but I think we got the nail that was poking through your slipper.
Well, you strike me as someone who's never going to get married, that's for sure.
I, uh, feel that things have been awkward between us, but just to show you there's no hard feelings, can I buy you a drink?
I also rubbed my butt on you while you were unconscious.
And there's the splitting headache from wearing someone else's glasses.
You died, and I'm here to take you to heaven.
Hurry, take everything, and be quick or we'll be in bigger trouble than a fat guy at a water park.
All right, now when Joe gets here we're just going to tell him he needs to lighten up on Brian, and then we'll all talk this thing out so we can move past it.
Joe, we all know what happened and we're here for you.
But we think that you're taking this revenge on Brian just a little too far.
The Triscuits are the rosemary kind, not the regular kind.
Me? I'm not the guy who violated the sanctity of someone else's marriage.
Well, you make a good point, Joe, and you're right, this is Brian.
We all know he don't care where he gets his wick wet.
Okay, we might be getting a little off track, here.
Even though Brian's been trying to do my wife for years, and on some level, I hate him for it.
Oh, Brian's a complete dick, we all know that, but I think we're losing sight of the point that Bonnie's a weird slut who's always letting you know she's open for business.
I'm Bonnie's friend, but she could sometimes get the mail in something other than a robe.
Quagmire, I want you to think of a card, but do not tell me what it is.
For years, she gave up her own dreams to take care of Joe.
Maybe she needed to because she feels so trapped in her marriage.
No one ever takes the time to ask how I feel.
They don't get us, Bonnie, and you deserve better than this.
Like, I can finally start my jewelry design business making earrings for tweens.
That is the sound of not making an enormous mistake.
It was torture just watching him do a crossword puzzle.
Boy, it's just so comforting to be here surrounded by other people's memories.
Can you hand me another nylon that I use as a sock with my huge beige shoe?
Yeah, you've been putting your pipe out in some guy.
All right, Vickie, time to shut you down for the night.
She's really gone, and she took little Susie with her.
Although, Brian might want me to be his best man.
Then I'd have to go, and I'd have to dance.
It would be weird to be best man and not dance.
And I'd have to give a toast, and say that Bonnie's the best thing that ever happened to him.
You know, she is the best thing that ever happened to him, but don't worry, Joe.
You know, like, Bonnie has an ex, but Brian marks the spot.
I hope Brian and Bonnie are as happy as us.
Bad news: the teenage runaways at table four were not big tippers.
That's like the capital of making and selling your own jewelry.
I just don't know how to make the metal go into shapes.
If you could talk with even a little bit of inflection to your voice, so it doesn't sound so much like a power sander.
Well, I'm sorry, but Kim Kardashian did get famous for making a sex tape.
You're such a know-it-all, Brian, you don't even know about your own body.
This is just the no food and sleeping in a car talking.
We can make this work, like couples who meet on Craigslist.
Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room, and then I'm done with my volunteer hours and we never come back here again.
You're worse than that Juliette Lewis who makes out with dogs.
Listen, we're very sorry we stole from you, but you have it all back now, so we cool, right?
You will spend time with us every afternoon after school, doing jigsaw puzzles, reading us the newspaper, listening to poorly remembered stories that have no point.
Feed me pudding while I grip your wrist in terror.
See, if I make under 20 grand for 20 years, my film school debt just goes away.
Any time I quiet my mind and clear my heart, it always leads me to you.
Over the years, I probably have become too dependent on you, and I'm sorry if you've had to put your dreams on hold because of me.
I promise I'll spend the rest of my days taking care of you, just the way you've always taken care of me.
Hey, Bri, came to try that apple pie you were texting about.
Well, Chris and I sure learned a lot this week.
We're going to have to do these at the same time.
So Chris and I learned that just 'cause people are old, that doesn't mean you should steal from them.
No. But I am done messing around with neighbors' wives.
'Cause maybe then I'd like it. Hey, let me see that.
There's a sign in the bathroom that says, If it's brown, let it mellow.
I know it's a little pricey, but it's the best preschool in the area.
Really? Is that the one where they make 'em dress in the little shorts and hats like the guy in AC/DC?
I didn't know I'd have to wear it when I'm 60!
It's grounds for dismissal if anyone ever got fired here, but they don't.
Can you just charge me my weirdly uneven price so I can be done?
Oh, no, we got to start saving our pennies now that we're sending Stewie to a new school.
Yeah, I'd be happy to get you an interview, and as a white woman, you'd be a minority here, unless you're an alcoholic.
I've been kidnapped three times because I come from money.
Stewie, what would you say to a playdate at my house tomorrow?
My word, it feels so good to finally be where I belong.
Do you have a sweater big enough to fit all of us?
Oh, the post office anticipates that within the next five years at least 200 million men in this country will be ordering and receiving RealDolls.
Asians, blonde Southern girls, blonde Asians capable of performing every possible sexual act, or at least incapable of refusing.
You can put one in your car and drive in the car pool lane with it and then maybe you push her head down, thus defeating the purpose of the car pool lane while fulfilling the purpose of the RealDoll.
Maybe later you ask yourself some tough questions, like, Why is it so important to you to impress and excite truckers?
I'm gonna show you why you should never mail cash.
Another good postal tip is, if you wait to deliver your mail at night, you can smell a lot of really nice dinners.
Got to deliver these fat pants to your fat son.
We got to special-order Cleveland Jr.'s pants from a company that manufactures grill covers.
Yeah, I've only met her a couple of times, but yeah.
He used to drive the bed for Michael Jackson's monkey.
Oh, it's fine, I suppose, but you probably have even nicer things at your mansion.
Y-Yes, you-you should come see my mansion, b-by all means.
I'm gonna kill a wrestler-- but then after that, you should.
Come on, let's go see if the maid brought her son, so we can push him and he can't do anything.
God, I like it here, but what am I doing?
And so I say to you, America, we are going to win this war, we're going to end this depression, and there's no reason to suspect that I cannot walk.
Now, if you'd kindly kick me into the closet with the mops.
This is a letter to Hollywood, saying, Keep it up! Movies are great!
I-It just says Hollywood, U.S.A., and this isn't a stamp, it's the little sticker from an apple.
It's all the stale mail what never got delivered for one reason or the other: incomplete addresses, house at the top of a hill, anyone who uses one of those
You know, you do the uniform proud, like I like to think I-- oh, chili dog got me.
Aw, there was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club got a lot of mail.
Why would Peter write a letter to another woman just before our wedding?
Well, then why don't you just deliver the letter and see for yourself who this Gretchen Mercer is?
No, he won't talk about anything serious unless there's a crackling fire to punctuate uncomfortable family revelations.
I never found you attractive, and what's more, I never respected you.
Chadley wants to have a playdate, here at my house!
Come on, Stewie, Chadley should like you for who are.
I've seen the fat man pee through Lois' legs while she's sitting on the toilet.
What I've got to do is find a spectacular house that I can pretend is mine to impress Chadley.
I can't, they're having an Eyes Wide Shut party all weekend.
Let's-let's all just find our wieners and then put the masks back on.
Oh, yeah, we found an old letter addressed to you.
Wow, well, um, here-here's the nutty thing: believe it or not,
I see you move your finger along as you read.
He was just writing to say that he was excited about getting married and that he finally had enough
Camel Cash to get a leather jacket and a pool floatie.
Oh, I understand, but you have nothing to worry about.
So, you can only be injured on your Achilles' tendon?
My mother dipped me into the River Styx and she held me by my heels, so that's the only part that can be injured.
As far as Chadley knows, this is where I live.
Oh, just some rich idiot I saw bragging about his vacation on Instagram.
You pull it out of me and put it back on the roll.
You know, this is a great house for a party.
Relax, these people are gone for a few more days.
I'll invite everyone over and impress the whole class in one shot.
And when it does, I'll be as popular as the first kid in school to get his driver's license.
Maybe after school, you could take me to get some groceries?
Yeah, or maybe you and me hop in that car of yours and do some grocery shopping?
All I know about cars is what my mom does.
Oh, yeah, of course, but what the hell are you doing here?!
You know, the one where you said that you were having doubts about marrying Lois and you still had thoughts about marrying me.
Gretchen, I am already happily-- moderately hap-- relative-- I am--
Oh, then I suppose your wife is entitled to know that you were still in love with me just days before your wedding.
And I don't know what to call the thing you're doing to me, lady.
Look, Gretchen, I-I know I wrote you that letter, and-and-and I meant it at the time, but... it was 20 years ago!
I may have had some doubts before my wedding, but what guy doesn't?
Well, she's a lucky woman, and I'm sorry for what I said.
I certainly don't want to cause any trouble for you.
It's just that when I got this letter, it reminded me how sweet and funny you always were.
Thanks for not making fun of me for ordering a hot chocolate, and go ahead and look into Facebook
Wait, before we say our final good-bye, what do you say we have one last hurrah?
I've got two tickets to a Ray LaMontagne concert tonight.
It feels a little weird going out with another lady.
Let me go home with one last good memory, and then I promise, you have heard the last of Gretchen Mercer.
Well, I should probably say no, but I've never been known for my good judgment.
I mean, that's how I got into trouble with the Peter Catcher.
Oh, Peter, you can take off your hat and jacket.
It's not illegal for two old friends to go to a concert.
I mean it's not like anybody I know would be at a Ray LaMontagne concert.
I just feel too guilty being out with another woman.
Well, I guess there's no shame in coming in second, huh?
Wow, looks like you're actually gonna get away with this, Stewie.
Over in the guest bedroom there's a girl pulling a train.
Hey, by the way, how'd you pay for all this?
As your rich host, I would like to say a word if I may.
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to have finally found a group of peers with whom
I share so many common interests... and here come the people who live here.
Hey, Lois, you mind if I cut out of here?
Not to be too intimate, but I need to have a bowel movement and I can't go here.
I can only go at home or at the Koo Koo Roo.
I thought I heard something over the roar of my tinnitus.
Ooh, a text. I'm taking care of our problem. We'll be together soon.
Oh, this woman is clearly a spurned lover who's planning to kill Mom.
Well, well, well... if it isn't the first Mrs. Griffin.
Making sure Peter can finally be with me, which is what he's always wanted.
Gretchen wants to kill you, and I have a slip that says we've got a package?
Lois, Lois, before you read that, you need to know one thing:
You told an ex-girlfriend a week before our wedding you were having doubts?!
No, I was in love, which is what I thought you were, too.
Not a day goes by where I don't thank my lucky stars for picking you.
I can't wait for you to meet the dogs and the squirrels.
No, Peter, I was lying so she'd let her guard down.
Now come on, let's get it on thru a P.O. box.
Wow Mom, I can't believe you got fired from the Post Office.
Well, they didn't like me beating up Gretchen on federal property, and then after your father plugged up that P.O. box, there was a mutual parting of the ways.
Well, Stewie, I guess since Lois lost her job, you're not going to be able to go to that fancy preschool anymore.
No one knows, but she's rich, as rich as Ray William Johnson.
We now return to The Price is Right, now with male models.
Let's look at this beautiful new car, presented by Ken.
Me and the guys were using them to shoot crab apples at Old Man McCratchen's truck.
I, uh, kind of got my own game going on over here.
To try and get my shoes sucked into the escalator so we can sue the mall.
When did we go and get ourselves in such a big damn hurry?
Hi, uh, I'll take two tickets for the Ladybug Express, please.
Okay, well, if he's the conductor, why don't he have electrical tape wrapped around him for safety?
We're gonna go check out the rest of the mall.
So, I'm thinking about getting my ears pierced, you know, big black gauges.
Then, I can just work at a bike shop forever.
Sorry, sorry, my buddy sent me a bunch of Romanian porn, and now every girl I look at I imagine throwing onto a table.
Hey, I bet lots of millionaires come in here and hit on you all the time, huh?
Uh, better see if it'll come off when I ski Aspen.
I know I'm a nerd, but I have, like, a thing for rich guys.
All I have to do is bring the ring back when she's not working.
It's a perfect scam, like Teddy Roosevelt getting to be on Mount Rushmore.
I'd stop, but Catherine Zeta Jones' big hands are on the back of my head.
But all I did was drink Scotch, smoke cigars, and this.
I haven't been this scared since the silence of the lamb.
Say something! ...and I turned around, and I don't know what happened to my wife, and now I'm all alone and I'm just so scared.
Do you want to go look for your wife, or you want me to finish the makeover?
When I find her, I want her to go, Wow.
No, but I figured if she's banging a guy like you,
Are you still-- by the way, you have no idea what a helicopter sounds like-- are you still keeping up this charade?
Shelby's already off work, so I'll just grab the ring and we can bring it back before they close.
If you're referring to the ring that I thought was a lug nut, I ate it.
But don't worry, it'll come out of my body sooner or later.
It became a manhole cover for, like, three days, but then, pow!
You're loved. the Quahog Mall will be closing in five minutes.
Paul Blart, if you're out there, I could sure use a miracle.
If this train slows to less than 50 miles an hour, then Sandra Bullock has to marry a neo-Nazi and act like she didn't know about it, and then overcompensate by adopting a black kid.
Like an actual Amtrak train, this is dangerously out of control!
On your screen is a list of actual rail disasters.
Coming up, the secret to remaining upbeat after getting an elderly waitress.
But we begin with breaking news from the Quahog Mall, where a local fat man was stuck overnight on a child's train.
We now go live to the newest member of the Channel Five news team, Dallas Portland.
So, Mr. Griffin, you were going around in circles for 12 hours.
Are you suffering any ill effects from the centrifugal force?
Oh, my God, Bonnie, are you watching the news right now?
But did you see that sweet, new piece of ass,
We had a bottle of wine and a joint at Bonnie's house, and we want to watch Dallas Portland before the buzz wears off.
I'm here in his studio above the Petco to see if I want to nama-stay for the whole class.
That chiseled Adonis with eyes the color of summer's first blueberry?
I don't know about none of that, but look at that bulge in his shorts.
I've never seen a bulge in the front of a man's pants before.
Well, we got to get that ring out of you, and this is a place where people buy disgusting cereals to help them poop.
Are there any gray-haired lesbian art teachers who can help us select a fiber cereal?
This won't take long, we know your large dogs are tied up outside.
We've got to start a chant so they'll file out into the street!
I was just trying to get this guy to poop, but now we're this close to getting sex outlawed in the United States.
Lois and all of her friends are drooling over that new news guy.
Getting out of that wind storm that screwed up my hair and loosened my tie, but also trying to forget how mad I am at Dallas Portland.
They're grooming Dallas, which means I'm on my way out.
If that guy becomes the anchor, every night is gonna be...
Sorry, I still get a little dizzy from the train, but if Dallas Portland's on TV every night, my life's gonna be a living hell.
Without the news, I... I don't know who I am... but what can you do?
But wait a minute, maybe if we work together, we can solve both our problems.
Well, if he's the hot, young thing and everybody loves him, all we got to do is make you hotter and younger and thing-er!
I'm doing this for my mother, who taught me to sing when I was only seven.
She was my biggest inspiration, and she was... taken from me when I was 12... in a fatal car accident.
She was my rock... my beacon... and this one... this one's for her.
So, tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I'll tell you want I want, what I really, really want...
All right, Tom, if you want to be young these days, you gotta do a wicked awesome GoPro skate video.
That's why we brought you to this fast-food roast beef restaurant.
Excuse me, is this the line for people who need to puke something up?
Okay, Tom, uh, our top story tonight: a burst water pipe in the pediatric unit of Quahog General results in the tragic drowning deaths of four children and one nurse.
Boy, I never realized how young and hip Tom Tucker is.
Dallas Portland should just pack it up and go home.
Tom's about to tattoo the word, Coachella on the bridge of his nose.
Channel Five News anchor Tom Tucker has been relieved of his duties, effective immediately.
Bear Scares will be back after message from state-run industry.
Katie Couric went on TV and stuck a tube up her butt and they threw her a parade.
I mean, you're the one who was drooling over that Dallas Portland.
I was just trying to get that guy off the air.
It's like when you watch Mad Men for that chick you said was like a fat me.
Thanks to me, he's fallen even further than Charlie Rose.
Today on CBS This Morning, we'll be talking about how much sleep you need to not be drunk from the night before.
You don't have much time left to return that ring.
We'll just have to take a bumpy ride to the mall and hope for a miracle.
You know, Brian, this wouldn't have happened if you were just honest with women and had an ounce of integrity.
Well, who's gonna be fishing through a tub of crap soon, you unemployed buttmunch?
I-I want to help you get back on your feet.
Thanks to you, it's over for me, like Billy Zane.
No different, except I have to poop from all this running.
Yes, um, I'd like to make a return, please... and maybe take you to dinner?
Look, Tom, Tom, before you do anything crazy, you should know one thing:
Hey, Tom, the camera's gonna be on you in a second.
Before you jump, could you just hand me this microphone, like you're passing me the torch?
Getting an interview with a crazed jumper on the brink of suicide.
Tom was just trying to talk me down, and if there's a news story here, the only one I'm giving it to is Tom Tucker.
This is Tom Tucker atop a roof, where a local crazy person is preparing to end it all.
Tell us, crazy person, why are you doing all this?
I'm doing this because I ruined a guy's life... and I feel awful about it.
It's the only thing I can think of to make things right.
Well, whoever this guy is, I'm sure he appreciates what you're trying to do for him.
I think I speak for all our viewers when I say, don't do this.
If that's what the most trusted newsman in Quahog wants.
Well, I'm glad your crazy stunt worked out and Tom Tucker is back at Channel Five.
Yeah, apparently, when he interviewed me up on that roof, the ratings were so huge, they made him anchor again.
I know I'm a nerd, but I have, like, a thing for rich guys.
Well, Chris, looks like another day of nobody joining us for lunch.
Yeah, we never should've let that blind girl touch our faces.
Attention, students. This is Principal Shepherd with the lunchtime announcements.
And as a special treat, I thought I'd deliver them in the rapping style you kids are so enthused about.
And when you go out to wait for the bus
Mm, go in orderly fashion, or your hair will get mussed.
I can't hear you, I just presume somebody must have yelled You suck.
Don't forget it's time to vote for homecoming king and queen.
Wow. Can you imagine if one of us was homecoming king?
Then people would want to sit with us at lunch.
Maybe I'll surprise everyone, like when you find out a buttoned-up librarian is actually super sexy.
Well, there goes Jerome, loading the urinal up with ice.
That's when Taco Bell throws all the breakfast food in the Dumpster.
I don't know where they went, but someone's got to pay this check.
Damn it. They left without me, and now I'm stuck with the bill?
Man, who do those guys think I am, Mark Zuckerbrothers?
Since there's no one here, do you mind turning the TV up?
I just hope he ain't down there in my shoes.
Well, the voting is tomorrow, so I've got to write my speech.
Luckily, Chris Griffin rhymes with homecoming king, so I've got my opening line.
We got to be at that school tomorrow to help pick up the pieces when he loses.
We're gonna go down to Carver High School and look at that mural of black achievement.
Mm, they got a manila folder taped over Dr. Cosby's face.
What? Cleveland, you didn't tell us you had plans with Jerome.
And if you elect me, I will be as good a homecoming king as a touchdown.
And our final nominee for homecoming king is Chris Griffin.
Webster's dictionary defines smegma as a sebaceous, cheese-like substance around the head of the penis.
Like that Bourne movie where they couldn't get Matt Damon.
All right, students. The votes have been tabulated, so if you could all look up from your phones for a minute,
I brought a bag of marshmallows and a belt for Chris to bite on during his meltdown.
All right, now it's time for these four poor kids to thank you for subsidizing their lunches.
Well, as king, I shall eat this breakfast on a tray in front of Wheel of Fortune.
How does nobody see what's going on with this Chris thing?
The only reason they elected him king is because they're gonna prank him at homecoming.
Because this kind of stuff happens all the time to unpopular kids.
They're just trying to embarrass him and make him look stupid.
You don't really think they're going to pull a prank on Chris, do you?
I don't know, but if they are, we got to get down to that school and talk 'em out of it.
Like when I went on that campout with One Direction.
So they checked into their hotel suite, but the minibar had no sparkling water.
They looked in the wardrobe and discovered that the stylist had only brought non-skinny jeans!
Simon, did I ever tell you the one about the loose-fitting T-shirt?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
All right, if we want Cleveland to stop spending all his time with Jerome, we got to remind him how much fun we are.
Hey, how foon would it be if we waved sticks around?
'cause that's-that's like our favorite thing to do around here.
Okay, we all know how much Cleveland loves Tecmo Bowl, so let's start playing.
I'm in my own end zone. What am I doing?
I don't know, a lot of football still to be played here.
All right, if we want to get Cleveland back, we should just put out his favorite snack: an open can of tuna.
Often he'll come running when he hears a can opening.
Yeah, I think it's time we addressed the elephant in the room.
I suppose people do want to be with their own kind.
Good evening, white guys who weigh less than their girlfriends.
God, a lot of gym teacher suicide memorials in this place.
All right, let's find the coolest kids here, and see if they know anything about a prank on Chris.
I don't know my way around the school, so I figured I'd get the deets from a couple of seniors.
Brian-- it's not Goldberg, by the way-- we should ask about the prank.
Hey, uh, I'm new here, but you know what'd be crazy?
If me, a guy, went in the girls' room with you two.
I mean, that would be, that would be so wild.
Well, we realized you like hanging out with Jerome because he's black, so we wanted you to know we can be black guys, too.
Yeah, in fact, we can even be famous movie black guys.
You really think I'm only hanging out with Jerome 'cause he's black?
I hang out with Jerome because, unlike some people, he actually takes an interest in my life.
And he would never stick me with the bill by walking out on me at the Clam.
Well, we could have come over and graciously apologized, but we took a chance.
Sucks we didn't find out what kind of prank they're gonna pull on Chris.
I know that book is The Hunger Games with the cover taken off.
And finally, tonight, a moving story from James Woods High, where the student body has made their homecoming a special event for a very special boy.
And this year's James Woods High homecoming king is Chris Griffin.
That's right. Chris Griffin, a tubby spaz with a heart full of dreams, gets to feel normal for a night, thanks to the kindness of his peers.
I just see him walking around with his hands down his pants all day, and he's just so fat and weird, so we feel bad.
Yeah, last year we did the burnt up kid, so this was a slam dunk.
Oh, my God, they just elected him out of pity, because they think he's mentally challenged.
The only reason Chris is homecoming king is that all the other kids feel sorry for him.
So, uh, hey, congratulations again on that, uh, homecoming thing.
Why congratulate me on a right and natural turn of events?
I shall select three things from Stewie's room that I wish to be mine.
There's a book in there on how to eat healthy.
Well, he obviously doesn't know it's just a pity vote.
In fact, this whole homecoming king thing seems to have just gone straight to his head.
It is an honor to serve the king in this manner.
Well, my script is brilliant, and I'm a great director.
The question is, how bad do I want this part?
Peter and the fellas think that you and I only hang out together because we're both black.
I mean, you don't think I hang out with you because of your endless stories about working your remote control or your fat son or how you once made a dog shake its head no?
Man, I guess this whole friendship was a bad idea.
And where are people looking when they're driving a car?
You know, being homecoming king doesn't mean you can just start acting crazy.
You're just jealous 'cause you've never done anything that deserves being elected king.
They only picked you because they felt sorry for you.
Well, because they all think you're a, um, you know, groundskeeper at a public institution kind of guy.
Tonight, when they put that crown on my head, it's gonna be the greatest night of my life.
I say, we were a little hard on Chris, but I'm glad we came.
Hey, look, there's the security guard that threw me out of the bathroom earlier.
The boys' showers shall run red with the blood of my enemies.
You just voted for me to make yourselves feel better.
I may not be king, but I learned I don't need anyone's pity.
And, hey, you're not the homecoming king, but you'll always be my brother.
Hanging with Jerome was fun, but my best friends are right here in this room.
Hey, to celebrate, how about we play a little old-school Double Dribble?
Okay, but no stupid-ass shots from the corner, because that's a glitch in the software and...
All right, bring it up the court, and corner three!
My computer locked up right in the middle of this story I'm working on.
Well, for starters, you can keep talking with that lovely accent.
Amazing. One second of a stranger's voice on a phone and you've got full Bollywood.
Well, one problem I have is that I have too much money.
Uh, actually, my computer froze right in the middle of a story I'm writing.
Ah, thy japes and jabs cut me to the quick, squire.
It means, I use this collar as a bib for when I service guys.
Can't you put a tall flag on the back of your chair or something?
Bonnie's out of town, so I have an extra ticket for Tuesday night bingo down at the Allendale Mill.
Why the hell would I want to go to bingo?
There's the thrill of the game, people bring snacks, plus you'll hear some pretty unfiltered opinions about those jokers in Washington.
You know how much I hate being told what to do.
But I'd have to say my least favorite curry is Ann.
I... I wish I could have slipped that in earlier.
How come over there they just talk on the phone, and over here they're all doctors?
Get out of here. Lois said you're supposed to sit on the potty for one hour straight.
And you've been on the phone for more than an hour.
Look, I know it's crazy, but I honestly feel a connection to this woman.
More than I have to anyone in a long time.
I usually bring a variety wheel of Laughing Cow cheese.
Oh, you just must be cracking up all the time hanging out with this one.
Look, ma'am, I don't know what signals Joe is sending out, but I'm married.
Or-or how about this one? Oh... my God, I want to kill myself right now.
Well, except for when I won that Tori Spelling Bee.
Peter reached this round by accurately spelling collagen, repulsive and botched.
Okay, looks like this is gonna be a stander-upper in the garage.
I wish I could just somehow magically appear there and meet you in person.
Hey, everyone, the guy I told you about, Brian, he's taking me to India!
Excuse me, man with no pupil, where can we get a taxicab around here?
Come on, I think I see a cab with less than nine people in it.
Me and the gang are trying to hear our numbers. You and the gang?
The Mayflower also brought fungus, which then became the Potato Famine.
Peter, I brought you here to have fun, not take over.
Look, Joe, I'm a little busy right now, so I'm gonna have the Somali pirate from Captain Phillips tell you something.
You know, this is where the Beatles came to ruin their music.
Anyway, Padma works in Bangalore, so we got to hurry and catch the train.
I'm just going to stand here wearing a shirt that appears to be a jacket.
Do you think all those chickens had to buy tickets?
What I wouldn't give right now for a big juicy steak.
And why did Wes Anderson come here to make his worst movie?
Stewie, what do we do? Quick, hit the red buttons!
Now let's get out of here. Let's see what their wieners look like.
I'm sorry, Lois, but my people have come to expect a certain degree of pageantry.
Now, you go over there and take him with you, or I don't want you going at all.
Hey, hey, hey, don't try to take this away from me.
This is the only thing I've ever been good at.
Why don't we all go ahead and turn to page six in the handout?
The first thing you're gonna notice is a bar graph.
And what that is is to indicate our international sales, which peaked, of course,  Oh, yeah. during the last quarter.
But now we're expecting that to drop off as we enter the colder weather.
I feel like I owe every bus in America an apology.
So, we haven't discussed what you're going to do if she's a pig.
Because I was having a technical issue with my heart.
Ugh, 16 hours on a plane, and that's what you came up with?
I am touched you came all this way to see me.
Well, I have to admit you two do make a cute couple.
But then again, so did Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow.
Do you take this woman to lecture you about trans fats for as long as you both shall live?
And do you take this man to be a watered-down Bono until death do you part?
Well, if you were born here, then it must be a magical place.
Yes, let's go get sandwiches at that New Delhi I keep hearing about.
In fact, my family is having a big party tonight.
I hope they play that one song with the shrieking, nasal, atonal woman over the bongos and tambourines.
Yeah. Well, that, and this is always what it looks like on Homeland right before there's a drone strike.
Not me. Mine is actually an Aladdin costume from last Halloween.
Family, guests, and monkeys who have wandered in to steal fruit, it is my honor to welcome you to this engagement celebration.
Everyone, you are all so kind to come tonight, and it is so nice to meet you, Dhiraj.
But something happened today, and I can no longer marry you.
He has come to me all the way from America.
I have already paid a large dowry to Dhiraj's family!
But it would be wrong to marry someone I do not love.
Sir, what if I were to repay you for all you've spent?
Would Padma then be free to marry whoever she wanted?
Yes. I love you, Padma, and-and I'd do anything to be with you.
Great, just give me a chance to raise the money, so I can marry your daughter and make her happy.
He's holding onto an Applebee's gift card with $1.62 on it.
I mean, my wife and I have never said the words open marriage, but...
Peter, it's time to come home and give Joe back his stupid little activity.
First of all, this is my favorite thing in the world now, so no.
And second of all, we're about to play a new round, so start taking your pants off,
Peter, if it wasn't for Joe, you wouldn't know about bingo anyway.
This meant everything to him, and you've taken it away.
As a friend, do the right thing and give Joe back the happiness he found here.
Damn it, I didn't want to have to do this, but you've left me no choice!
Let's all go home and each do our own individual media things.
We're never gonna raise enough money to pay back Padma's father.
Trust me, Brian, there are a billion people here, and almost every one of them has a tapeworm.
I originally just came for my junior year, but I fell in love with the place.
Stewie, there's no way I'm sitting here all day watching tapeworms come out of butts.
First question-- Which retired Indian cricketer has scored over in ODI competition?
You know, the more I say it, the more it does sound Indian.
We'll be right back after this message from the Indian Census Bureau.
My father has solved the problem by promising Dhiraj the hand of my younger sister.
Oh, Padma, I meant to ask you, are there, like,
Wait a minute, so if, if Dhiraj is marrying your sister, that means we can be together!
I think watching you try to answer that question out there,
Brian, I am deeply touched that you came all this way to find me, but the truth is, you and I have very little in common.
I mean, I mean, there's got to be an old Carmen Sandiego episode on India or something.
Have I answered all of your questions to your satisfaction?
Well, by coming here, you saved me from a lifetime of unhappiness.
When you least expect you'll find magic in your life
Oh, in India it's traditional to do a final musical curtain call over the end credits.
Brian came so far, but he never found a wife
We now return to the extended director's cut of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Brian, this does not seem appropriate to watch in front of the baby.
Huh. This one's dry, but the back of the seat in front of it is wet.
Uch. All they're doing is announcing that they play the kazoo, and then asking if others also play the kazoo.
If you want a song a baby'll like, you've got to get a baby to write it.
Well, I... I did write a musical about Alexander Hamilton.
And those guys back at the factory can suck it.
I'm gonna go across that river and make it to the city on the other side.
Hey, Bublé, I got a tune for you to sing.
It's called Get Your Ass Back on the Forklift, Lunch is Over.
Dad, can I have 50 bucks for a shamrock tattoo?
All right, but make sure you get it where everyone can see.
I-if Chris wants money for something, maybe it's time he got a part-time job.
Well, Will Smith's little kid works as a movie star, even though he looks like a wet baby horse.
Well, maybe even my old job as the guy racing through an airport at the end of a romantic comedy.
The most amazing girl I've ever met leaves on a plane in five minutes.
Final boarding call for Ashley's flight to stuffy New England college. Final boarding.
If you get there on time, there's an extra 50 in it for you.
I wouldn't miss this for all the rush hour fares in Bigtown.
All right, Brian, I've written a few songs, all about stuff babies actually care about.
Momma liked to party when you were in her belly
Momma liked to party when you were in her belly
Easy. I figured out the perfect way to get the word out to middle-aged moms.
A lot of people seem to be turned off by my dishonorable discharge.
These little things of applesauce better not be for desserts.
I am just so busy, I-I don't have any time to organize my own life.
Wait a minute, what if you had someone to help keep you organized? Chris is looking for work.
Look at that. Look at the cake. Happy Birthday Charlie and Uncle Craig.
Oh, the birthday boy and I met at Burt Reynolds' acting camp in Jupiter, Florida.
You know, the last time I saw you, you were...
Uh, hey, listen, uh, I don't know if you've heard, but we're the entertainment.
It's about those six children watching and the spazzy kid who's just waiting for the snakes.
I'm gonna go feed everything in my van to each other.
Okay, kids, if everyone's done washing their hands from the snakes, we have some fun music for y...
All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt, and here's a song we call Mommy and Daddy's Room.
And we think it's one you can all relate to.
My God, did you hear 'em, Stewie? We're a hit.
Uh, let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.
You really think this Olivia thing is a good idea?
I don't know. It just seems like it always ends badly for you two.
Okay, Chris, I think you're gonna be a great assistant.
Your paperwork appears to be in order, but before we get started, do you own a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear if you worked on a fishing boat?
All right, I guess it'll be a light day today, but tomorrow you should come wearing those.
Now, the first thing I need you to do every morning is punch me in the stomach because I'm a bad person.
Now I need you to call Time Warner about my cable bill.
All right, this one is for all the mommies out there.
Smear it on my button for the fire down below
You know, I talk a lot of smack, but at the end of the day, these guys are pros.
I'll go get us another badly-scratched plastic pitcher of soda.
Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs, you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod...
Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like damn you all or what the dude or whatever.
Uh, it-it's deuce. But, uh, but yeah, you're-you're right, it... I-I do.
Does it-does it sound through the mic like I'm saying dude? Should it be dude?
Meanwhile, everyone thinks Brian is the star of the group.
I don't know. I'm just saying, after every show, the fans are always petting Brian, and not you.
I just hate to see Brian getting all the attention that you deserve.
I mean, he was there for me when I hit rock bottom.
Now get out of here, we're about to drink some Chardonnay.
Chris, could you please get Hannah a thank-you basket and schedule her next appointment?
Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you at 3:00 a week from Thursday.
And would you like to leave your panties in the fishbowl for a chance to win a free lunch?
Oh, there's no drawing, I just like smelling the bowl.
Why don't you jerk the rest of the day off.
And to think I almost took that pop-up restaurant gig.
I'll tell you what my problem is: I'm doing all the work and you're just riding my coattails.
What are you talking about? I'm just as big a part of this group as you are.
Oh, really? You're writing about all your authentic baby experiences?
I don't know, he saw that in a movie or something.
I think it's time to talk about your future with the band.
So, you want to fire Stewie and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?
You're the whole reason the fans even like the band.
Besides, we've both seen what Stewie's become: an impossible diva.
Yeah, well, your friend has been talking about kicking you out of the band.
And I don't know if you've considered this, but the clock is ticking on Stewie's cuteness.
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up looking like an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.
Hey. I had a thought about our costumes for today's show.
I could wear a shirt that's both red and blue, and you can do spin art with all the wussy kids who are afraid to go on rides.
You are looking at the new Red Shirt Blue Shirt.
What the dude? Uhp, you know what, deuce was right.
Like Cheers wasn't the same when they brought in Kirstie Alley.
But I do need to make that spreadsheet or I'm fired.
Not just that. He also takes pictures of Quagmire's genitals to track sore growth.
What? You're the one who wanted Chris to get a job.
I'm calling Quagmire right now and putting an end to this.
If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180.
STEWIE, BRIAN & OLIVIA:  Daddy rolls over and falls asleep
Yeah, I guess, but did you see what I saw?
I can get a hundred dogs to fit that stupid blue shirt.
So, I'm looking for money to open a small business.
It's a sexual fetishist who derives erotic pleasure from dressing in horse-themed leather gear.
Chris, I have $1,100 in a paint can in the garage.
Just take that, and we'll never speak of this again.
There's just something about her flat chest and muscular legs.
Look, I never should've treated you the way I did.
So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us and go back to the way things were?
Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep the band going.
Probably. She told me she was just gonna replace me with another dog.
I don't know. Probably some dog neither you or I have ever met.
Every child here has seen a relative murdered in a barber chair.
Teach an old Italian lady how to use an iPad!
Now, that sounds like fun. I'll give it a try.
Hey, how are you? Look what I got for you.
I bet you if Joey was giving it to you, you'd take it.
You thought he was making 100 grand a year hauling lumber?
Admit it, you wish it was me in that car instead of him!
Well, then who's that guy who looks like a young Frank Sinatra?
Oh, that's Woody Allen's son, but you're right, that other guy behind him is Frank Sinatra, Jr.
My dad will drive long distances for ice with colored liquid in it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that, but it's a shame we can't get good Italian food like this in Quahog.
Well, maybe the three of us ought to open an Italian restaurant there.
Oh, yeah, all my pockets are lined with Reynolds Wrap.
Dean Martin, Jr., Joey Bishop, Jr., and Sammy Davis the Third.
It must be all the violence in movies and sex on TV.
Peter, we need to talk about what happened at the street fair.
You're supposed to yell Bella, Bella and grab as much fat ass as you can.
I had no idea he had so much pent-up aggression.
We have to deal with his anger issues before he hurts himself.
I've seen what happens when people hold in their aggression for too long.
I got to get down to the business center to print out my boarding pass.
Hey, look, I don't know if you guys are really staying here, but you can't get into the pool without a room key.
Okay, Chris, your mom and I want to help you get out some of that aggression, so I thought you and me could huck rotten apples at passing cars.
Oh, I didn't know we had brown apple in the forecast.
Hey, which one of you threw that apple at my car?
I work out my right arm three times a day.
No, mostly JPEGs of Helen Hunt on my hard drive.
Well, I'm Coach Doyle, and I head up the baseball team at James Woods High.
Tell me, son, how would you like to pitch for the high school team?
Just like Jesus' friend, Evan, who bailed on the Last Supper.
I would've gone if I knew they were gonna do a painting.
Then I realized how stupid that is and I went to the bank for a loan like an adult.
Now, fellas, the tables should all be bolted to the floor to prevent theft.
You know, most restaurants go out of business because people are stealing the tables.
Great. Now let's go find some chump's restaurant and steal his tables and toilets.
James Woods is winning for now, but y'all never know what might happen in the moments to come.
I mean, look, there's two baseball guys out on the bases right now.
Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck.
What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking bringing in that fat slob?!
I bet you a hundred bucks that fat slob strikes this kid out.
Three strikes and he's out, just like my cousin Freddie with the drugs.
I just won a hundred bucks off Chris's baseball game.
This dad took one look at Chris and thought he'd suck, but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.
I'm so proud of the money I won betting on him.
You know, I bet there are plenty of other baseball dads who'd also assume Chris stinks.
And then a record whose proceeds go directly to creditors.
We just need to make you the face of the restaurant.
I ate this morning talking, but I think that's a swell idea.
I can't believe we made all this in one game.
Yeah, I'm having a great time handling this money and then touching my eyeball.
Our top story tonight, the James Woods High baseball team is headed to the district championship, thanks to their secret weapon, star pitcher Chris Griffin.
This sucks even worse than when I stubbed my toe.
Look, Brian, I affectionately pat all the waiters on the ass.
And if anyone has a problem with it, they should come to me directly!
I-I've been going through our receipts, and we're actually losing money.
Damn it! I can't believe my kid isn't making money for us anymore.
Well, there are plenty of guys willing to bet on James Woods High to win, I'll tell you that.
The only way we could ever make money now is if Chris lost.
All we got to do is take those bets and get Chris to take a dive!
You're gonna ask your own son to lose on purpose?
Oh, well, then maybe I'll just say this to you in Spanish.
You may not believe this, but there was a time when Snapple ruled the nation.
Dad told me I have to lose the championship game on purpose.
Did you tell Chris he had to lose the district championship?!
What do you think puts the food on our table and the garbage bags on our backs?!
When you get on that field, you try your very best and play to win.
I'll be out a ton of money and I'll have to kiss a fella!
You've got to stop giving away all the food for free.
Yeah, otherwise there's no way we're gonna make a profit.
I might be doing a Duets thing with that Lady Goo-Ga.
Anyway, the restaurant's gonna go under if you keep giving away food.
Oh, I get 40 bucks every time somebody says my way.
Look, I'm sorry, you guys, but my hot piece-of-ass wife says no way.
It's a weird time to brag about your wife, Peter.
We're screwed once Chris takes the mound with that awesome arm of his.
Wait, so what you're saying is Chris isn't the problem, his arm is.
All right, I'm gonna exit while discreetly checking out the hot chick by the door.
I don't know what that means, but let's go rough up a teenager for beer money!
Perfect! And we look like regular high school students, so we'll fit right in.
Trust me. I bought the absolute latest issue of Archie comics, and this is what the kids are wearing.
As is the case with many restaurants, you're going to have to pay for your food.
Yeah, the only reason we eat here is 'cause it's free.
Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's restaurant, you would've paid.
If you need me, I'll be back in Palm Springs, which has been completely taken over by the gays.
So, want to grab whatever wine is left and then burn the place down?
Maybe, but first, let's have an unearned end-of-the-series moment where we turn out the lights on our own place.
Well, 'cause we broke his arm like you told us to.
Quagmire, this is humbling, but it may be time for all of us to talk about hearing aids.
I feel terrible! I got to go find my son!
But listen, Chris, I had no idea this was gonna happen.
Look, I was wrong to bet on your games, and it's even worse that I told you to lose.
I just feel bad that my arm is broken in so many places and hurts so much.
You found something you were great at, and instead of being happy for you,
And now your arm is broken and your baseball career is over.
Well, for the last few weeks, since my right arm's been exhausted from pitching, my left arm's had to, uh, pick up the slack in the bathroom.
Well, Chris, we're very proud of you for making it to the district championship.
The next pitch Chris threw hit his coach in the head, so there was no one to take him out of the game.
But at least I didn't have to pay out all those bets and kiss a guy.
But I saw you kissing the driver of that Camaro.
Coming up, why one hello a day to the receptionist at work is the magic number.
Picketing began on Thursday... Weird day to start a strike...
So ground control is telling Major Tom this could be long one.
It says I'm no longer covered on your health insurance.
I need that health insurance. You know I have a hernia.
Well, if you need insurance that bad, maybe it's time for you to go out and get a job of your own.
Actually, I got it performing an incredible act of heroism.
Originally now, but it's been delayed until 9:40 due to weather in Philly!
More than once, if I have anything to do with it.
Who wants me to stow my bag under their seat?
Boy, and I thought the Federal Hill bakery had nice buns.
It's a work vest from a little place called Mega Hardware.
Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News in front of the old boob tube.
I don't like drinking NyQuil out of them little cups.
I'm not. You took a pretty hard right turn back there.
This is one of them places where women go to see male strippers.
If it weren't respectable, why would real estate agents go to strip clubs for lunch?
Captain Cockpit, my friend is about to get married, and we were wondering if you'd have sex with her for $500.
N... uh, no, I, uh, uh, w-wanted to know if Quagmire was available tomorrow evening?
Uh, but I'm unable to properly have sex with my wife, so I figured, you know.
I was sweating that pilot strike, but now that I'm a gigolo, I'm making money by the fistful.
Hey, Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice you got some dry cleaning hanging up in the backseat of your car.
Well, I hope you're not actually doing that gigolo thing.
Uh, uh, no, no, no. It's, uh, it's something else.
Uh, geez, I got to go home and change into my Tarzan costume.
Can you tell me where I can find extension cords?
Meg, that was the last guy, so just lock up when you're done.
One of my tricks drove me here from the Clam, and I didn't have any money for a cab.
No. After it was over, she said she wasn't gonna pay.
You can't let these women take advantage of you like that.
What apartment is she in? I'll go talk to her.
You know, if you're going back in anyway, can you grab my belt?
So I'm gonna play with your doorbell until you pay up.
No problem. It's just too bad you're not here every time.
I mean, my days are pretty open, and I don't sleep a lot at night 'cause of health stuff.
Hey, maybe you could drive me around and help me out, and I could even pay you a little something for your time.
It'll be nice having a little extra cash to bet on college football.
Maybe from the store, but it's not like things take a day off from needing repairs, am I right?
Oh, looks like this cabinet door is a good place to start.
Don't want to get a code vi. Vi is violation. Code is just code.
Ah, come on, that's just stuff you pick up on the site.
I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig a shim jamb strap hinge quarter-round soffit two-by-six dowel cherry-picker flim-flam.
You know, Rupert, Brian's douche-iness should infuriate me, but the truth is he seems happy.
So I guess I'll just do nothing and that's that.
Boy, I have a whole new respect for Hayden Panettiere.
Oh, hey, Peter, listen, I can't work tonight. I'm spent.
That last trick was like trying to use an empty bottle of hand soap.
But you got to work. I set up five appointments.
That's a lot of money. Sorry, I can't do it.
You're going out if I tell you you're going out, bitch!
I didn't know we'd be doing this pimp thing, but I made a promise to my body.
Um, Big Pete, if we're gonna be sitting, may I use my penis donut?
You know I hit you and whore you out because I love you, right?
You can't have my bread, but you can have something of mine that smells like bread.
Just so you know, it takes me a long time.
All right, Rupert, if we're going to teach Brian a lesson, we're going to need some muscle.
Anyone who doesn't enjoy the music of Josh Groban can get out of the (BLEEP) car.
Okay, if you had a friend who worked at Mega Hardware, how would you get him fired?
You know what, Carlos, you stay quiet for a while.
Okay, is there any idea out there besides killing a guy or getting someone deported?
Well, you just offered to kill a guy, so you're not exactly number one on my roommate list.
Now, let's go. I paid good money for you, I need answers!
I want your best, and I won't stand for even one more stupid idea!
Huh. I guess that Brian Griffin is a good egg after all.
I never liked prostitutes because they sell their bodies to all types of men.
I turned my first trick when I had my first one-night stand.
I hear on SNL the women are funnier than the guys now, but I don't know, I'll never see it.
We meet Quagmire, a small-town boy with big-city dreams who has fallen deep into the game of prostitution at the Point.
You know, some people ask me, Would you want your son to be a hooker?
My answer is always, Hey, lady, are we talking, or am I beefing ya?
I kind of want to see Guardians of the Galaxy, but I also kind of feel like there might be scary parts.
You know what that means? Shopping for groceries is what I say instead of, Do you want to pay me for sex? so I can't get arrested.
Stewie, did you hire three Mexican guys to shake a soda can and give it to my boss?
Parading around there, pretending you know the first thing about tools.
You're going down there with me right now to tell them what you did.
I'll get Lois. She can take you to the hospital.
It says I have to make an incision, retract the hernia sac, and then suture the abdominal lining.
And then hold the incision open with a vise grip, and use the slip-joint pliers to get the muscle back in position.
It's from aisle eight, above the chains and cables. Monofilament line, slip-joint pliers.
I've got to say, Brian, it seems like you really did learn something on that job.
That guy who killed Joan Rivers must be terrible at this.
Hey, I'm freezing. You got a blanket in there or something?
I got a towel, but it's wet because I'm eating peaches.
I guess I just got caught up in the money and-and assumed you were okay with it because of the sex.
Speaking of which, the Pretend Pretenders are playing again this weekend.
Uh, much like the real band, we have been described as meh.
Can you find it in yourself to forgive me, and maybe we can just go back to being friends?
Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.
Uh... we can't go into the time machine right now.
Sorry, I was in my trailer eating fancy nuts and smoking.
Okay, I'll be in my dressing room playing online poker.
You might know me from banging your niece on a pile of your brother's pool equipment.
But tonight, I'm here to take you behind the scenes on the set of Family Guy.
For the first time ever, you'll see what a typical production week is like for TV's 11th favorite family.
It's certainly not easy being a family that also happens to star in a sitcom together.
Especially last year, when I discovered those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern on Peter's phone.
But he explained that his phone number was the old number of-of her ex-boyfriend, so... what was it again?
So the photos were on the Cloud, and that the-the Cloud pulled the pictures or...?
I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him, and that's why he has them.
And-and we both called the Apple store, and they said they can't disprove that it doesn't happen, so here we are, still married, still on the show.
A-And it's happened five times since then, and some of the pictures had both Peter and the girl in them.
Being on this show reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from Macbeth.
Oh, yeah, it's great, you know, doing a show with your family.
'Cause what guy doesn't want to go to his office and have his family there?
You know, and then you go home after work and catch up with the family.
Just trying to make it to the weekend, so you can, uh... spend some time with the family.
Now, I-I understand the show was quite different when it started.
Yeah, in the original pilot, I was actually the star.
Well, it can't be any worse than what's in here.
What they didn't know is that I'd been privately doing jokes about the newspaper for years.
But, you know, it's not just the Griffins who work hard to make Family Guy what it is.
Here in the props department, some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.
You know, a lot of people don't realize SEAL Team Six actually completed their mission in this puppy.
Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy, and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.
The only reason I stay here is to maintain my profile for my start-up business, DiscreetCrepe.com.
Hi. Are you a straight, adult male who likes to eat crepes without people making unwanted assumptions about your private life?
Go to DiscreetCrepe.com, place your order, and within 30 minutes...
Now I just need a guy's butt to eat this off of, and I got myself a night.
But of course, every episode of Family Guy starts with the writing.
And here we are... the Family Guy writers' room... where the writers are hard at work with the show's talented cast.
Look, don't get me wrong, guys, I-I think it's hilarious, and-and I totally get that the sex thing is what made me popular, but would it kill us to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?
Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant where he was spying on ladies peeing in the bathroom.
As part of the class-action settlement, he entered rehab, and that's where he found Jesus.
He still runs Dumpy's, but I'm pretty sure that one's legit.
All right, butthorns, which one of you idiots wrote this script?
Can you show me how to turn off the flashlight on my phone?
And another thing, I read this piece of garbage script.
Well, why you hiding all these pages behind the first page?!
You know I'm only tough on you 'cause I hate you, right?
Yeah, over the years, Peter's become just a total nightmare.
He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set, which is, like, a totally real thing.
He'll only rehearse with helium balloons with crudely drawn faces on them.
It's difficult having to give up my chair for the balloon.
The Fat Man's behavior has been deteriorating for quite some time.
And I think someone may have placed an anonymous phone call to the network about it.
Word around the stage is they've decided to finally fire Peter and replace him with another actor.
Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes, so he could shoot that crappy movie... what was it?
It was a remake of Old Yeller where the dog gets the drop on him and kills him first.
They miscalculated the number of dogs who buy movie tickets.
I mean, Dad's the only one in the whole production who doesn't know he's being fired.
The table read is where the Family Guy cast reads aloud that week's script to see how the story and the jokes are working.
And where Peter will learn he's being written off the show.
Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read for this week's episode, entitled, Peter Dies (We're Really Serious, No Joke,
Oh, and there's other pages. You got to turn them.
Here, let me show you. Interior, Griffins' living room, day. Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.
Stewie's gonna fire up his time machine and undo this. Stewie enters.
My time machine got a virus that causes Dad to die again if it's ever used.
They'd have to bring in someone to replace me. Uncle Ricky, played by sitcom buzzard
Let's just play with Uncle Ricky instead. The family cheers.
I'm sorry, Peter, but the production just can't deal with all your nonsense anymore.
This is painful for all of us, but we just don't see another option.
Yeah, Peter, we love you, and-and you're still part of the family, just not part of the show.
Look, I don't know who brought this on, but maybe it's for the best.
All right, fine, you bastards can fire me, but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.
Boy, we picked quite a week to document the production of a Family Guy episode.
Yesterday, Peter Griffin was fired from the show and replaced by David Spade.
Given this surprising development, we decided to follow Peter, and see if our cameras could capture his story, as well.
Chateau Marmont Hotel, where I once engaged in the consensual murder of an underaged prostitute.
Yeah, well, I figured if my family doesn't want me on the show, there's no reason I should keep living with them.
I-I mean, there's no hard feelings, um, I just feel like this is best for me, and this is best for those cancerous dicks.
I already got an audition to be the caring dad for a Cheerios commercial.
When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store, and now here I am, stuck eating cereal for dinner with a kid.
Wednesdays are rehearsal days here at Family Guy and the first rehearsal with David Spade appears to be going very well. Uncle Ricky, what are all these strippers doing in our house? Uh... each other?
Yeah, I got to be honest, I'm having a blast.
You know, now that I'm not tied down by the show, it's given me more time to pursue my true passion: weaving sexually explicit tapestries featuring the Minions.
Thursdays at Family Guy are reserved for shooting all those flashbacks and cutaway gags we love so much, and what most people don't know is that all these gags are directed by James Cameron.
You know, many viewers think our cutaways are just whipped together, but they actually go through a rigorous testing process before filming.
This is the planet Jew-piter, and he could say, Next year is my star mitzvah.
It says don't take it with alcohol, but you should take it with alcohol.
I also need a couple for the girl I'm babysitting.
Meanwhile, David Spade is making lots of friends on set.
I agree, there's a lot about your character that's still untapped.
Okay, thank you, because, like, yes, I'm greased-up and, yes, I'm deaf, but what else am I?
Yes, your death threats to Grimace have all been returned.
I believe that's still seasonal, but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid, and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.
Now do you want to leave the regular way, or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?
Well, this seems like a really cheery place, and looks like some guy named Brooks was here, and I think this is gonna work out just great.
You don't miss your show or your family at all?
Of course I miss my family but everything comes to an end eventually, a-and you just... you just got to keep moving forward.
I-in fact, I was just about to melt some cheese on chips if you want to stay for a sad, single guy dinner.
Friday night is tape night here at Family Guy, but tonight they'll be filming the show without Peter Griffin.
I have to admit, it's a little strange taping a show without Peter.
I'm especially going to miss the Fat Man's bit with the audience where he fires the T-shirt cannon at his own head.
You know he once tried to hold up a store with that thing?
And with regard to Peter's replacement, well, as his parents and previous co-stars have learned, a little of David Spade goes a long way.
I mean, there's only so many jars I can open for one man.
He has tiny hands but when one of my rings went down the drain, he got it right out.
Meanwhile, Peter has wound up here at the Chinese Theatre, where panhandlers dress up like iconic movie characters and charge tourists for photos.
Step right up, get your picture taken with beloved comic icon, Little Lotta.
I am taking back my TV show and my family.
I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin, but we have specific orders not to let you onto the lot.
Well, I suppose, you could come inside if you had an idea for a show the heads of the network wanted to buy.
So, you see, he's got a Tumblr account and he's clumsy.
Absolutely, but just a thought: what if he doesn't bumble?
They bought the pitch, but, um, after a series of network notes,
Bumblr with a Tumblr eventually aired as Bamblr with a Famblr, which made sense to nobody and is now in its third season.
And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt of Kermit the Frog acting like a hip-hop guy.
Don't put it on. It'll fall apart, but listen, everybody, I realized something.
I've been a real jerk... to you guys, and to all the union fat asses that I assume do something to keep this thing going.
The fact is, I got too big for my britches, but I know now that I'm nothing without all of you.
Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand, and if you guys can find it in your hearts to take me back, well, then I promise that every day I'll prove to you how much the show, and how much my family, means to me.
Oh, wait, if my character's still alive, that means we don't have a script to shoot.
We just happen to have a whole extra script right here. Pete, Don't Fail Me Now.
Oh, I have a goatee up till the first commercial, and then I'm a teacher.
Every week, Peter becomes a diva so the writers write a fake script, killing him off.
He storms out, then by Friday's taping, comes crawling back, and we shoot the real script.
Of course, he always forgets by Monday, and then he becomes a pain in the ass again.
Does it bother me that he does this every week?
So, I guess this actually was a very typical week on the set of Family Guy.
I'm James Woods, and we'll close tonight with a supercut of every time in the show's history that Peter got hit in the crotch with a bag of nickels.
Hey, Lois, you should do that thing that I like...
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached our cruising...
Do you think I'm ever gonna be able to have...
Peter, I need you to take Chris and Meg to school.
Today's the day I finally kill that squirrel that's been eating our tomatoes.
You know I like to watch two full movies before I go to work.
Once the floor is full of sawdust, we can eat peanuts in here.
Dad, are you sure it's okay that we took Brian's car?
He's the one who keeps his key in the visor like a carefree hillbilly.
I don't want the cool kids to know I'm your dad.
Guess who I just scored as my date to the homecoming dance.
Yeah, her husband just died of ALS, so she is ready to get at it.
I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go to the homecoming dance with me?
I don't know what that is on account of being dull.
Uber... it's like a cab except it feels like a game
Can I just give you 20 bucks to drop me off?
And it's got to be easier than when I was delivering pizzas.
None of the girls at school want to go to homecoming with me.
Probably 'cause everyone calls me names like Big Nips and Fat Nips and Big Fat Nips.
Oh, it's just something people say instead of working to change their own flaws.
Anyway, you just got to do what Taylor Swift does and shake it off.
Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane, nor clowns, nor a posse, I'm not interested.
What? Why would she go to a dance with me?
I'm telling you, this is exactly the kind of thing she would do.
I'm just gonna lie here moaning, thinking about Taylor Swift.
Oh, it's easy. You and I will just make a video about how sad you are and put it online.
If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone, just like you did on New Year's Eve.
Don't I... don't I need to fill out a form or...?
All I need to know is: do you have a car, a phone and a face?
Now get out there and try to kiss as many ladies as you can.
Stewie, I didn't want to do all that fancy stuff, so I just did a video of me speaking from the heart.
You know, telling her how much it would mean if a girl like her went to homecoming with a guy like me.
I just saw your video, and I'd love to go to your dance with you.
All right, I got to go eat an ice cream cone.
Uh-oh. This means I have an awkward phone call to make.
Our top story tonight, pop star Taylor Swift is coming to Quahog to attend a dance with local high-schooler Chris Griffin.
But first we go to commercial while our sports reporter smiles and spins a football for some reason.
Oh, Rupert, I can't believe Taylor Swift is actually going to be in our house.
I haven't been this excited since I abused those caffeine pills to get ready for the big show.
Everything will be fine, as long as I take one of these.
This must be how Meat Loaf looked when he went to the prom.
And I can't wait to go to the dance tonight.
Quick question: in Shake It Off, you invite us to get down to, quote, this sick beat.
I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure, and you indicate when I should stop.
Taylor, this is my sister Meg and our dog Brian.
I'm sorry, uh, which cast member of Hee Haw are you?
It was so nice to meet you all, except for the girl and the dog.
Well, you wouldn't say that if you ever saw us at the movies.
All right, we got our popcorn from home, our soda from home, our snacks from home and Braveheart.
Great. Just a couple of errands and we'll get you there.
You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!
I always sing about high school, but I've never actually seen one in person.
Sure. But you're gonna have to stand back, like, five and a half feet.
Usually people just shove a wallet in my mouth and call 911.
I was scared meeting a celebrity, but you're so nice and normal.
Sorry, I just smoked a joint with the pickup truck kids.
I hope you don't mind I made the band pay me a royalty for each of my songs they played.
Aw, that's one of the best fingerings I've ever had.
Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor of some of her favorite things.
Here's flowers and crop tops and pictures of Kanye West with his mouth shut.
You know, she's the first girl to ever really understand me.
You might want to see this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.
I-I thought you said Taylor had a good time the other night.
She even let me grab the part of her body which on others would be a butt.
Aw, man, Chris, this computer is telling me that you done Swifted up.
She gets into relationship with guys, sabotages them, and then writes angry songs about it.
Well, why can't we? She has a house in Rhode Island.
Okay, would you like the AC on or the windows down?
Hey, you ever go in a hot tub when it's snowing outside?
What if we change lox to boys and bagels to problems?
Like when you changed pickle it good to shake it off.
I ruin relationships with nice guys and John Mayer just so I can write songs about heartbreak and moving on.
You're never gonna find a real relationship if you keep doing this.
Why don't you guys all come to my show tonight as my guests?
Well, that'll be even cooler than when I was in that remake of The Princess Bride with Bill Cosby.
Now, one of these has the iocane powder, you see, and one of them makes you go sleepy-bye with your mouth open.
This is what we do to Uber drivers in this town.
You can't just buy a phone and become a cab driver!
I was a boy, no more than 11 or 12.
Said I reminded him of him when he was my age.
Of course, we were all husking corn back then just to keep the lights on.
And you burned my car while I was telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.
You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!
Well, I guess they're just used to me being sad and hurt by men.
But it doesn't seem like your fans like this new happy Taylor.
Are you willing to risk losing them and jeopardize your career and your art just for us?
Taylor Swift, you are a spoiled ostrich-legged, no talent, big-footed freak.
You pretend to relate to your fans, but you make your bodyguards carry your purse.
This next song is about my dumb ex-boyfriend, who either mistreated me, cheated on me or went to massage parlors when I was out of town.
No one will ever be close to as good as her, but we'll find you someone.
Let's get out of here. I called us an Uber.
Well, kids, your father may have gotten beat up, but Uber's still a great job for anyone afraid to sell their blood.
And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Taylor Swift.
I think we're all sorry about that, Brian, but I'm afraid we are out of time.
Hey, we'll see you down in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?
Didn't have time for him tonight, but let's see if we can get him back next week when Amanda Peet will be here with stand-up Dom Irrera.
Upon realizing a trip to Africa would be smelly and gross, our crew decided to stay in the office.
Okay, all-all right, everybody just calm down, it might just be Grandpa Munster.
Yeah, see, if it was him, he would have said, Like I do every night: upside down.
Okay. But Peter, we can't have a bat flying around the house.
Everybody, I've come up with the perfect plan to catch the bat.
I bought this remote- controlled toy helicopter, to which I have attached this handgun.
And I tell you, this thing is not easy to fly.
Now, I don't have anything to control the trigger with, so I put it on a timer.
Okay, so, now the bat has a gun, and the knives I gave him.
In order to understand the bat, we must first understand the vampire.
Oh? Then why am I clad in velvet pants tucked into soft leather boots?
And why does my shirt billow so in the wind of that rotating fan?
I need to live like a bat. So I got to be up at night.
Well, as everyone knows, bats watch a ton of Cinemax softcore porn, so that seems like the place to start.
Bat Industries was up two dollars a share today in heavy trading.
You can beat me, but I am who I am!
Peter, what the hell did you do to Stewie's hand?
I didn't mean to. It's just, sometimes I don't think before I act.
But he went by the Prophet when times were good, or the Law Giver when times were bad.
I moved onto his prayer farm with 45 other members of the Salvation Star Boys, who died in a mass suicide.
After it was all over, I called Lois to pick me up.
May the light of Derek's Invincible Diamond shine through you.
Oh, thank you so much for coming in early, Dr. Hartman.
Oh, but first, I'm required to have you read this pamphlet about the risks of vaccinations.
God, you are aging so rapidly. Possible side effects: fever, severe allergic reaction, muscle and joint pain?
Wait, and this can't be right: they actually put some of the disease in the shot?
But I don't remember having to read any of this when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.
Well, that was before Internet chat rooms made everybody an expert.
We might need a little bit of time to think this over.
Yeah, 'cause we don't want to make a big mistake.
Hey, man, we should get out of here, the building's on fire.
That's the last time I go to a water park,
'cause I have a Groupon, and I'd hate to waste it.
We were going to get Stewie vaccinated, but now, after our research, we're definitely not.
Ah, no, Lois, don't tell me you fell for all that anti-vaxxer crap.
There's a lot of evidence to suggest there's a link between vaccinations and autism.
Listen to some of these ingredients: mercury, thimerosal, aluminum, formaldehyde.
Lois, deciding not to vaccinate Stewie is something that affects all of us.
The only reason they work is that if a critical mass of society gets immunized, then the diseases won't spread.
Look, Brian, I was skeptical, too, but then I did some research and I found some very interesting things from the leader of the anti-vaccination movement,
Don't you realize you're contributing to a potential public health disaster by not vaccinating your child?
He's my child, and nothing matters more than his well-being.
Oh, God, this is going to be a Lois story, isn't it?
We got the other kids vaccinated, but Meg still got chicken pox.
You realize the vast majority of people think you're wrong.
We're gettin' this town to change its mind about vaccinations.
Just as soon as I finish gettin' the word out about the one thing more important.
Now you're trying to convince other people to make the same reckless choice?
I'm also gonna pet a bunch of dogs without asking.
Brian, all we want is for parents to have the choice.
You do realize they're putting your life in danger by not getting you immunized.
Very serious. Even the tiniest germ could make you very ill and, left untreated, kill you.
I'd expect this kind of thing from the fat man, but not Lois.
Although she did act like a nutcase that time she went shopping right before Thanksgiving.
Parents of Quahog and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch, do you know that the number of childhood vaccines has tripled in the last generation?
Because heartless corporations make billions of dollars by foisting garbage and poison upon our children.
We demand that these vaccines be tested by independent researchers, not by the companies who make them.
You can't just go to a park and list a bunch of boring facts.
Like I did when I was a lounge singer with uneven lyric density.
This is a song I wrote for my beautiful girlfriend.
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
But mostly I love that you let me eat crackers in the bed
Hi, I'm a medical guy, and I'm here to give you the facts about vaccs.
Fact... Vaccinations cause autism, paralysis, and even... death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death.
Would you let a doctor do that to your kid?
I see no boob bones, the victim was a man.
Speaking of which, do you have any idea the germs you routinely track into this house?
From now on I'm going to ask that you wear these shoes while indoors.
Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog have dropped to an all-time low, fueled by a recent media campaign led by local meddler, Peter Griffin, shown here in the basket of Henry Thomas' bicycle.
Oh, I knew one of these had to be my house.
Damn it, Peter, thanks to you, nobody in this town is vaccinating their kids anymore!
Man, there is a lot of bad art in these hallways.
Until further notice, no one may enter or leave the city.
Oh, that's the guy who bought the bullhorn at the park.
And look, Joe's arguing with a state policeman over jurisdiction.
Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk, so I have jurisdiction over all of you.
Because of you, there's a measles epidemic, and the whole town is quarantined.
Chris, you're supposed to whisper that to the next person.
We've got to get to the hospital and get Stewie vaccinated!
Eh, it might be a little too late for that.
All right, what else did I have to do today?
Is anyone else feeling feverish, achy, and acutely sensitive to light?
Now, hold on, hold on, before we all freak out, it might just be full-body herpes.
All he needs is a good, old-fashioned game of hot-breath telephone.
I've got to get out of this house, or I'll be in worse shape than John Goodman!
Horses that make it look like I can walk, take me to Hollywood!
I've got it down to four bags and a hatbox.
So, yeah, last weekend, Sheila and I took the kids up to the lake, it was great.
Sheila's parents came up towards the end of the week...
If I can just escape this quarantine and make it to the next town,
You've got to get the hell out of town before you get sick!
Okay, I'm really here because I know you have glue.
Stewie, listen to me, never, ever do this great thing I love.
So we're all there at the Clam, just kind of making music together, and then Peter, of course, had to join in and clap his hands, and I said, Eh, that's enough of that.
I hope my shoe doesn't fall to make me realize how far the drop is.
He says he's in charge of the group, is that true?
No, not in the slightest, but, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.
I don't know if he can hold on much longer.
Any time there's a public health crisis in a third-world land,
Have you seen some of the delis on Federal Hill?
I hope you've realized that vaccinations are not a freedom of choice issue, they're a public health issue.
Thanks to them, countless serious diseases, mumps, polio, smallpox, and rubella, have been all but eradicated.
Like clean water and functional schools, vaccinations are a human right.
Great, just what I needed, a lecture from liberal Hollywood.
This whole thing has been a lecture from liberal Hollywood.
Well, it's a relief that everyone's been vaccinated, and the quarantine has been lifted.
Well, I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy, and only 150 people died, but not anyone we knew personally.
You may be wondering what I'm doing in a library.
Well, I actually drove my car into this rich guy's house, and he locked me in here until the police come.
I don't know. I just locked him in the library.
Seems like he's on something. He's got crazy eyes and keeps screaming, I don't care.
Anyway, I've got some time to kill before this room is filled with tear gas, so I thought, Why not finally read some of the classics I never read in high school.
A book by the only respected guy in the world named Scott.
It was my first summer staying at the shore, but I had a feeling that I, Nick The Situation Carraway, would fit right in.
I just checked in, and somebody left their teeth here.
Yecch. The neighbors are having a party with loud jazz music.
Well, at least annoyingly scatting over jazz hasn't been invented yet.
I'm not sure. Women aren't allowed to ask questions yet.
He was clearly playing with himself through his pocket, but I pretended not to see.
Yeah, this old sport thing, is this... is this something you're trying out,
I just met you, so I want to tell you something very private.
I come down here to think every night and gaze at that green light.
Um, I hate to break it to you, but that light you've been looking at is a gay gym called The Pump House.
I-I only know that because I saw a coupon that came with my rental.
Yeah. Lot of weird coincidences for an American classic, huh?
I don't know, I'm just getting a funny vibe from you.
You asked me down to the docks alone, and you're getting a funny vibe from me?
Oh, yeah, it's not that palace of domestic abuse you live in.
Oh, I've missed you, Daisy. You're as beautiful as ever.
You know, one of the best parts of having an enormous mansion is being able to come out here and get some fresh air.
You know, sometimes I just want to jump off this balcony and into that pool down there.
Were you, uh... were-were you this crazy when we dated before?
I've been hearing about your vast newly acquired wealth and your attentions to my wife.
So I thought I would have you over to my equally large and fancy but imperceptibly more classy mansion for an awkward dinner.
She plays golf, and is what kids will someday call a DUFF.
I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it.
In the book, I actually go on a few dates with Jordan.
'cause you earned your money a little bit more recently than me.
I'm saying I invited you over and sat you next to my wife to say, Stay away from my wife!
Let's all drunk-drive into Manhattan and get a hotel room and have the same conversation we're having here.
I'm starting to think this isn't a very good book.
I'd like to add another bit of pointless confusion that will make sense later.
I don't think Daisy said you could drive her car.
Look, if you're in your own car you're in the wrong car.
I got to talk to this random mechanic's horny wife about some business.
I don't know what they do up there, but they sure do listen to Def Leppard pretty loud.
Wow, looks like you guys are getting a head start on the Depression here.
Yeah, sure. Don't tell anyone how bad I look naked.
Wait, but first I want to see if we're in the funny horn era.
Let me show you how a classy guy does classy stuff.
Hello, room service? I'd like a bottle of your second most expensive champagne.
Okay, fine. Well, then let's see who has higher socks.
Well, I hear Gatsby didn't even fight in World War I.
That's right. I'm in love with Daisy, and she loves me, old sport.
Would anyone like a deviled egg from a tea I had several days ago?
But I sure do enjoy driving your car instead of you driving it, even though we came in a different car.
Oh, that must be Tom, since I saw him in that car earlier!
Where will I ever find another woman with a hotter name than Myrtle?
And with that, I shall step slightly out of range.
You were standing earlier in the day next to the car that hit my wife.
I would soon return to New York a changed man, because, for me, that will always be the summer that I finally put my head underwater.
I snuck up to the attic just before the cops busted in.
Only problem is, I really want to get to that trunk of costumes in the corner.
On the one hand, I don't want to give away my location.
On the other hand, there might be a pirate hat.
Oh, crap. While I figure out my options, here's Huckleberry Finn.
Hey, I'm your abusive dad, and I've been drinkin' all day from this here jug.
Oh, my God, is that a jug full of porn?
Hey, Widow Douglas, I want to live with my dad!
I just need enough blood to make it look real.
Oh, come on! I just got shot in the pool in the last one.
Lord, I'm-a tell ya, being a slave is a much worse job than the temp agency made it sound.
I'm runnin' away 'cause people want me to wear shoes and comb my hair.
I believe we've been out here a long time, and a man's mind begins to play tricks on him.
But I wasn't gonna tell Huck, 'cause he claimed he didn't see me hook-shot that apple core into the garbage from way far away.
It's a river... we can't control how fast it goes.
Hey, what if it's spelled with an A at the end of it?
If you're looking for a gym, Ye Olde Pump House is that way.
Tom Sawyer? What are you doing so far from home?
It's just being revealed now, but it happened hundreds of pages ago.
Well, while I'm being booked and processed downtown, we have time for one more classic of American literature.
I'm like to read 'em myself. Chapter one: eat my ass, pigs.
Wow. I remember when this used to be all orange groves.
We're going to open a bed-and-breakfast in the country, and we won't be afraid to let our guests know that we are Steelers fans in this house.
But we'll also have a sign in the front that says, Steelers fan parking only.
And sometimes we'll give our guests a fake hard time.
Like if they're Jets fans, we'll be all like, Okay, I hope you don't get towed.
But obviously, you know, of course, we're not gonna tow 'em.
Listen, we're looking for field work, uh, if you need any extra hands.
Well, three of our guys did just get squished, so we just might. Come on in.
Have we pulled an object off a plant and placed it in a burlap bag?
Yes, I think we understand the nuances of this profession.
Good, good. And how about you? Tell me about yourself.
Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies, and I thought, since you're covered with feces and I barely know you,
'cause I've already been killed twice in the other two stories, and I don't want...
As you can tell by the well, well, well, he's the bad guy.
This is where I practice my karate, 'cause I'm a dick.
Look, I can tell by the fact that you wear a single,
So, let's all take a deep breath and calm down.
Not great timing, I know, but can I leave early for a dentist appointment?
The field hand who gave me a shoulder ride back to the house?
Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady to get married to there.
Uh, again, you don't have to schedule that with me.
But remember, if there's any trouble, we meet by the big tree on the edge of town.
Yes, that was quite a hand job you did on him.
I'm not gonna lie to you, you're wasting your double entendres on me.
Oh, I just love a song that explains what it just said.
All right, evidently I have to go to the big tree on the edge of town to take care of something.
I'm sorry, George, I didn't mean to kill the girl, and now the whole town's gonna hang me by a rope.
But while I do that, why don't you face away from me and count the stars.
All right, so the B&B will have a rack of single-gear bikes for every guest, and yes, next to that, of course, is going to be the big, giant rabbit hutch.
Are We Talking About Jake Gyllenhaal or Jared Leto? I am oily-haired with dinner-plate eyes. I was in that one movie about the weirdo. I somehow look both deathly ill and ripped. I am a less successful version of Tobey Maguire.
Anyone? No? You would totally believe any story about me being a dick.
It says here that Carter Pewterschmidt has bought the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.
Wow, Dad. I guess that means Grandpa's your new boss.
You discovered the power to create new life, and you created a guy?
So I should've made a woman so I could have sex with a corpse?
All right, now that I'm in charge of this brewery, there's gonna be some changes around here.
For one thing, no more T-shirts or dungarees in the work place.
Effective immediately, you're the guy at the office with a weird ski tan, but you can't talk about it.
Ugh. I swear, Joe, the light was still gray when I went through it.
I have to confiscate your license, and you're gonna have to walk home.
Ugh. All right, I guess I'll just call an Uber.
You got to constantly tell everybody what a good idea it is, and how important it is, and how wrong they are for having traditional desks.
Can't I just work at it and mind my own business?
Maybe it can just be my own personal choice, and-and I'm not judging others for their choices.
That's what your standing desk is saying to the chair people.
Oh, and three times a day you have to say, Sitting is the biggest killer in America.
Good night, gender-transitioned co-worker we had a whole meeting about.
I want our beer cans made from the cheapest material possible.
But sir, if word got out about this, it'd be one of the most notorious developments in beer history, second only to Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach.
He actually said he wanted cheap, toxic materials inserted into the brewery's supply stream?
Well, his eyes looked different how he said it, but that was the gist.
Also, some of the brewery workers say very hurtful things if a co-worker wears shorts.
Mr. Griffin, it sounds like you've brought me an interesting story.
Is it Kermit the Frog when he's wearing a trench coat?
Sir, an anonymous whistleblower in the brewery says you've personally ordered the sourcing of cut-rate, potentially toxic canning materials.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I remind you, this is on the record.
You ever been with a man who's got a prostate the size of a beefsteak tomato?
I bet he's mad I told the news about him.
Lois, everyone, I've left your mother, and Tricia Takanawa is moving in with me.
It's never good to keep something that matters to you a secret.
Yeah. I told her I was leaving her, and she freaked out for no reason.
And I'll tell you, I don't know why they call it a sanitarium.
She just sent me a picture of her smoothie. Looks good, babe.
I heard you lost your license, and I'm gonna help you get it back.
But first, let's watch a safety video designed to terrorize you into being a responsible motorist.
I'll give you a no-seatbelt car ride after this teen kegger party.
I'd hate to lose it all because of making poor choices.
Ah, come on, man. I just had a couple of alcohol beers.
And I'm impressed with reckless behavior, so I'm going to reward him with my mouth while he's driving.
Now let's smoke a marijuana cigarette while I'm speeding because of a dare.
Hey, careful. I'd hate for you to be unresponsive to my pleasuring while you're driving because of intoxication.
Stewie, is this about anything but oral stuff while you're driving?
I'm a grizzled, seen-it-all veteran cop, and I'm shaking my head at the senseless waste.
The driver was being mouth-pleased at the moment of impact.
Yup, food's on the table, and if anyone needs some dirty underpants, the vending machine's right over there.
Lois, can I please have a dollar for the vending machine?
I thought you were supposed to be doing a news story on Carter, not shacking up with him.
The truth is all I ever wanted was to some day have a family of my own.
And I realized Carter could give me all of that.
Yes. A family just like this, in fact, with a fine son just like you, Peter.
A son to whom I could one day give a piece of sour plum candy.
But a lazy son who does not make me proud?
I'm gonna make you the proudest Tiger Mom of all!
I wonder if that's the worst thing that ever happened to a guy?
Huh. I wonder if there's anyone in here whose dad was a bigger dick.
Uh, Mom, why is Dad over there playing chess with Tricia Takanawa?
Because, Chris, your idiot father thinks she's his new Tiger Mom, and he's trying to impress her.
All right, Peter, it's time to master the game of chess.
No. You will do it in the traditional Japanese way...
On a wacky game show while a beautiful woman beats your scrotum with a reed.
Why is that guy laughing at me and where is he?
Peter, another way to impress your Asian Tiger Mom is to put on this old-fashioned baseball hat and assist Indiana Jones on his next adventure.
Yeah, let's get you out of the tub first, Doctor Jones.
You've got to constantly be IPDE-ing everything in your target zone.
I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what you're saying. Identify. Predict...
Now, check your gauges with one eye while keeping your other eye on the road.
He's started to respond positively to the caning of his buttocks and knuckles.
I wonder if I can tell you one of my deepest sexual fantasies?
All right. Let me just burp through my nose for a second,
Well, you're going to think this is silly, but I love it when a man confesses to manufacturing improprieties.
I ordered the brewery to start making beer cans out of toxic, unsafe metal, just to save a few bucks.
This has been Tricia Takanawa, with my undercover exposé of Pawtucket Patriot Brewery.
I sleep with him to find out, though I'm fairly confident the answer is yes.
Of all the women I've institutionalized Babs over, she's the one who meant the most to me.
It's like, one day she's my Tiger Mom, and the next day she isn't, and the day before that first day, she also wasn't.
That's right, Tom. Tricia's recent exposé on the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery has been nominated for a local Emmy.
You and I will go to the local Emmys, and we'll embarrass Tricia on her big night in front of all her peers.
'Cause people need to know that she's an even bigger fraud than Robert Baden Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts.
Ma'am, I'd like to take your son into the woods.
Well, what if I said we'd both be wearing shorts and neckerchiefs, and I'd give him little patches for doing what I say?
No, he had no idea what I was talking about.
He tried to Google it on his phone and ended up spilling hot coffee on his balls.
I took him to the ER and he said he'd pass me if I picked him up in an hour.
Now I'll be able to go to those dog parties again.
Tripling is when you vomit, defecate, and orgasm, all at the same time.
Now all we need is a distraction so we can spike her cocktail.
I know something that might distract all these news people.
Maybe if one of us just chuckles for no apparent reason, everyone else will start chuckling.
Okay. All Tricia's got to do now is take one sip and she'll blow it out of all three holes, right here in front of everyone.
And that will make us feel better about our life choices.
What honor? Connie Chung marry Maury Povich, form media super team.
Wow. Tricia's mom is really coming down hard on her.
You know, it's no wonder Mama Trish was so tough on me.
Who take care of me when I 121 years old?
Maybe what she did to us was wrong, but sheesh, look what her own life has been like.
You know, I just been thinking, the way you and me fell so fast for this lady, and for no reason?
I-I guess maybe I just needed someone in my life to fill that role.
Someone who loves me enough to call me fat and lazy and stupid.
And maybe I was just looking for a way to feel young again.
Well, I'm just glad all this nonsense with Tricia Takanawa is over.
Hey, Stewie, seriously, thanks for everything you did to help me get my license back.
I'm gonna come to you and ask for a favor.
I need to know that you're gonna say yes when that day comes.
Now, did you leave a plate of black coffee out for me?
In the future, please leave a plate of black coffee out for me.
Come on, Lois. After all, sledding was the second passion of the Christ.
Too many pansy-ass parents sue the city when their kids sprain a finger or crush their skull on a bumper.
You can't do that! Last time I checked, this is still the United States of Tara.
And I'm not gonna let anybody tell me where I can and cannot sled!
The whole world is watching! The whole world is watching!
You serious? All this white stuff used to be water?
Oh, it's a bedpan. I got a ton of these at home.
I just ran home to get the big sled out of our dining room.
Okay, now, since we're white guys doing something stupid, everybody grab a GoPro.
Am I the only one who thinks that now we're at an alarming speed?
Sorry, Lois. I honestly thought this was gonna be fun.
Now, why don't you clean up and go get the champ a Gatorade, huh?
Yeah, I know. It's just I got roped into going to some stupid office Christmas party with this girl I'm dating.
Really? I thought you just went to an office Christmas party with her last week.
Did you just say couch, but pronounce it strangely so it sounded like a name?
All right, look, I've been crashing office Christmas parties for the free booze and drunk women who don't want to spend the holidays alone.
Just like the fat man is a pool party creep.
Now, Chris, you're getting older, so it's time for you to learn the classic pool party game Talk to Somebody's Wife in a Bikini
Been kind of busy lately, what with Susie starting to...
Hey, Peter. Hey, what have you been watching on TV lately?
I feel like our days at this mall are numbered.
Let's see what kind of Chinese pressed-board garbage we can get to replace my grandmother's priceless mahogany table.
And then I might just sit in that car in the middle of the mall and cry.
Me and my adopted son have been waiting quite a while.
Hey, Chris, wait here. I'm gonna see what's going on.
I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you, but it turns out the seasonal Santa we hired has a drinking problem.
And I don't know where to find a replacement on such short notice.
Would you mind putting on the suit and playing Santa, just until the shift ends?
I mean, it's not the first time I pretended to be someone else.
I once dressed as a farmer to get a date on FarmersOnly.com.
Yeah. A-Are you the gross lady who lives in the converted horse trailer?
Well, I am going to fly us over a few more drinks.
I followed you. I had to see for myself just how desperate and pathetic you really are.
And don't worry, I'm not sticking around this sad little... Ooh!
Well, I could watch and make fun for just a few... Oh, my God!
And I want a tricycle and a pony and an American Girl doll and a drone with a camera and a gun that fires...
And before you go crying to your mom, that's my cell phone you're feeling.
Well, depending on how traffic is at the North Pole.
Well, the guy at the mall asked me to stay on till Christmas, and I said yes,
I got a free iPhone case and a tiny license plate.
I'm gonna keep looking around the room while you talk.
Yes, it's like watching a soap opera, what with all the drunken misbehavior and ill-advised hookups.
Oh, you won't miss her. She's still wearing the felt antlers.
All right, now we're gonna go to your home and wait for you to pass it, and then you're gonna eat it again.
He's gonna come in and watch me in the bathroom.
That lady turned off a Hall & Oates song because it was too provocative.
I'm gonna stir up some drama, make this party interesting.
Excuse me? Uh, could I have your attention please? Hi.
Unfortunately, since people only use printers now to print out boarding passes for their grandparents, be laid off as of Monday.
Oh, and whoever drinks the most shots keeps their job.
Mr. Redmayne, I don't know who you are, but I've been in charge of this office for 16 years...
I've been trying to reduce our staff costs for months, but just didn't have the guts to do it, much less before Christmas.
Yeah, well, that's why they send in Channing Redwick, or Chadmayne, or whatever,
I haven't been this excited about anything since the night Wicked premiered in Quahog.
When Italian guys die, they... they turn into... into... into...
Awesome! Okay, my first wish is for a thousand wishes.
All right, come on now, pal, seriously, who are you really?
Well, if you're Santa, then what did I ask for
Because it was the year you found that Penthouse in the woods.
You can't go around in that suit pretending you're me and acting like a complete jackass.
You're just exploiting my brand for personal gain and destroying my reputation.
So there's, like, no toilet on the sleigh, so you're, you're just, you're just crapping in people's houses, right?
Or else I will put you at the top of my naughty list.
You know, you're not talking to a little kid anymore, so get the hell out of my face, Santa.
Now, if you'll excuse me, you're standing in my strip club spaghetti.
I got to get this home to my family for supper.
I just found out I'm part of the downsizing you announced.
Gail, you were supposed to be gone an hour ago.
Why don't you stop rubbernecking and finish that payroll report I asked for?
Like the Little Drummer Boy when he got really into Neil Peart.
So, Dad, now that you made Santa mad, aren't you scared he's gonna do something bad to you?
Well, you sent another text that says, Hey, Joe, it's definitely me, Peter, who sent the text.
Whatever, I'm done with my bear. Let's get out of here.
Joe, I swear to you, I do not want to do that.
Would anyone like to lead the family in a holiday prayer?
I'll tell you who should be saying his prayers, Santa.
That's why I replaced one of his flying reindeer with an ordinary, non-magical one.
You know, I think this year is gonna be the best...
Well, you know it's a two, so why are we talking?
I thought working in a cubicle at a mid-sized printing company would be the adventure of a lifetime.
Yes, it's the maximum check amount I'm authorized to cut.
Merry Christmas, cash it fast. Merry Christmas, cash it fast.
Just stop terrorizing me and take me off the naughty list.
I've always known you were a good boy deep inside, Peter.
And just so you know there are no hard feelings, this is for you.
I had to buy it from a really creepy guy on the Internet.
You spread so much joy and wonder to kids everywhere, and I just used that to get stuff for myself.
Until I went home and had, like, 50 beers, and did forget.
But only after I screamed myself into a blackout while my whole family held me down.
Simply climb behind the wheel, drive it towards a Jew, and flatten him.
Could you also use it just to drive from place to place and stuff?
Yeah, yeah, you cou... Yeah, yeah, you-you could also use the Mona Lisa as a placemat. God.
Yeah, well, you know what else takes years of specialized training? Crossing your eyes.
I had to fly to Aruba, so I brought my mom along with my friends and family discount.
Well, you know I have that fridge in the garage with bags of blood in my blood type?
Oh, airline employees can get discounted tickets for family and close friends.
If I'm being honest, I've also got a few Celeste pizzas in that fridge.
I don't know, I-I guess I just figured you guys always have to work, or you're with your kids.
I'm going to San Francisco next week. You guys want to come?
That city from And the Band Played On and Milk?
I'm going with Bonnie and Donna to Donna's sister's time share.
Well, we can't both go on a trip at the same time.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I already have a taxi waiting.
All right, I'll go tell the guys I'm not going.
Why is he taking his suitcase to tell the guys?
You guys, come on, we got to go now. Let's go, move it.
I'm in the shower. It doesn't matter, we're stealing Lois' cab.
All right, the gay jokes are out of the way, now let's get down to business.
Okay, guys, this is the original Levi Jeans factory, created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853 so that gold miners could wear a comfortable yet durable fabric.
Peter, Peter, calm down, it-it's okay, we'll-we'll do whatever you want.
I was thinkin' we could tuck our shirts into our pants, put on huge helmets, and ride Segways.
Hey, I know we just met, but can I sit on your lap during your next post-game press conference?
This is exciting for the whole Bay Area, to be just four games away from the championship...
We've got to stay focused, keep doing what we've been doing.
Normally I'd just go to Hudson News and pretend to be the most important guy there.
Yes, I will have eight Dasanis and a JD Power & Associates.
Oh, that's a voice filter, so the passengers always think the pilot is a 60-year-old Midwestern white man.
Good afternoon, folks, this is Captain Dale Clark up here in the flight deck.
Our in-flight entertainment today will be Under the Tuscan Sun.
Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.
Of course I do. I just take a short break sometimes.
Short break? It looks like you had time to put together the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.
You don't have to touch it, Joe, you can just say you noticed it.
I go inside, magically go back in time, and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.
What the hell, Quagmire? So-so, basically, your job is just goofin' off.
Screw you guys. You know, being a pilot is hard work. Look, I tried to be nice and take you fellas on a free trip, and all you can do is crap all over my job.
Joke's on him. I farted just before he kicked us out.
Ooh, this is food for different routes I'm not on.
Oh, my God, those guys in first class have guns.
I'm gonna have to go to the backup communication system.
No. I'm landing at the closest airfield, which is less than an hour away. So just let him go,
America needs to be punished for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.
Do you really want to know, or are you just asking because we're gonna be on a plane for a while and you think you should make small talk?
I know, now I wish I'd just stayed home and finished my remake of Inside Out.
A flight from San Francisco to Quahog has lost contact with air traffic control.
I'll be here to update you as this story progresses.
Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s gets married without their dog being in the wedding.
Are you going to open this door, or am I going to start killing people?
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still the worst person on this plane.
Last chance. Open the door, or this idiot gets it.
I'm sorry, Peter, but I have to think about the whole plane.
There's over 150 passengers back there, several of whom are in our Commander's Club, and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.
You know, I have a gun in the bag I checked.
If we can get to the galley, we can take the elevator down to the cargo hold.
Oh, man, it feels like we're in one of those hijacking movies.
You're right, it does. There's even an impatient businessman who really wants to reach his destination so he can conduct more business.
Quick, he's distracted. Get off my plane. Get off my plane.
Oh, nice. Last guy picked for dodgeball, first guy for human shield.
The search for a missing airliner continues, as speculation grows that the plane has been hijacked.
What will our lives be like if our husbands don't make it?
Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.
And you know what you don't see from up here?
Joe, how'd you know that lever would open the landing gear?
I notice every wheel in a room as soon as I enter.
Yep, we wrapped this up quicker than the treaty signing at Appomattox.
So, if I sign this, the war is over, we surrender, and we still get to be dicks forever?
We're ten minutes away from landing at an airfield in Nevada.
Yes. I was in reserve in case the plan went awry.
And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan: crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas, but I never thought I'd lose my life there.
I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes, when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.
Get ready to say good-bye to your precious Rita Rudner.
No. We're going to crash into the biggest hotel on the Strip!
Killing Rita Rudner will just be the custard on the dumpling.
You know, we never quite nailed down what region you guys are from.
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker with the latest on the hijacking crisis.
As you can see, I've taken off my blazer to show the severity of the situation.
It's apparently veered off its flight plan and is headed for Las Vegas.
The government, fearing the worst, is considering shooting it down.
Oh, look, there's one guy who slept through this whole thing.
Only a few more minutes until your country pays for its imperialistic sins.
Like-like, how come you Eastern European guys can't be quieter in pornos?
I mean, nobody's ever been like, Yeah, yeah, more guy noises.
They ask us to do that to cover up the sound of children playing nearby.
Oh, come on! Doesn't anybody pay attention to the sign?!
And look! Even that plane with all the missiles is impressed.
And our communications are jammed, so we can't even tell them everything's okay!
They've got a hostage in a blue shirt with a white collar.
No, he isn't. He's g getting in position to fire!
Sure was. And we learned a lot about blue jeans,
Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases in San Francisco, and I saw some things
I know I, for one, am ready to put all this behind us.
They show every sex scene on TV without all the boring dialogue and plot.
Okay, once again, nothing is happening on Homeland, but over on Masters of Sex, Lizzie Caplan is hooked up to electrodes and getting it from a guy who sounds American, but probably isn't.
Hey, we're gonna split the screens now because my producer is telling me on Game of Thrones we got a malnourished Albino plowing a girl in a tub as he names dragons.
Oh, there's a Bone Zone alert for Girls, which we'll ignore,
Last time we went to that, we lost a lot of subscribers, and we're keeping an eye on The Knick.
We don't want to bring you dead boobs, but if they're alive, we'll get you over there.
It's almost 3:00. I got to get out of here.
Eh, the airline's making us all attend a seminar about what do to if someone flies a drone into your flight path.
Yeah, I hear that kind of obnoxious behavior is very big right now in the dangerous idiot community.
Really? I didn't see that in the newsletter this month.
Just a big article about how to tailgate a speeding fire truck to get places faster.
Wait till they get to the golf course and find out there's no fire.
And most of them have cameras so people can spy on whoever they want and invade their privacy.
Even more fun than when I had breakfast in bread.
Hi, Lois. It's a great morning, no matter how you slice it.
Yeah, I don't know what this is Peter, but we're four months behind on our mortgage.
I'm taking the kids and I'm staying at my parents' for a while.
Look, Stewie, I don't have time to sip air and pretend to eat a wooden hamburger patty.
Real tea, real milk, and the best honey you'll ever taste in your whole life.
Yup, Mom missed soccer registration, so this is my weekends.
You know, you could probably charge, like, $20, $30 a jar.
I feel like an eighth grader who just had sex.
It's just the cat that ate his face and ears off.
Now, how many bees do you think are in here?
Now that seems like nothing because of your idiot million guess.
All right, now, if you're going to sell honey at the farmers' market, you need to practice.
So you be the salesman, and I'll be the customer.
I was just in the back and I heard a commotion.
I simply came here to enquire about honey and your employee spoke to me loudly and with profanity.
Brian, please, I trust that this handsome young customer knows what he's talking about.
Oh, my, and I thought only bees pour on the honey.
No I'm just in town for the John Singer Sargent exhibit at the museum. Really?
Oh, God, please don't let that be our new neighbors.
Some kind of crazy van with the number 87 on the side.
Only the star tight end of the New England Patriots and America's most athletic Polish.
All right, time to Gronk a dump in my new house.
I wanted to bring over something to welcome Gronk to the neighborhood. So I scraped all the cool ranch off of 15 bags of Doritos.
Yeah, I thought he could eat it by the fistful or rub it on his balls.
Rob Gronkowski is probably the worst neighbor we could ask for.
It's not like it's that tasty piece of ass, Julian Edelman.
I know he's a wide receiver, but if he's giving, I'm taking.
I'll be here hooking the G to thoughts of Edelman.
You want to come in and eat pizza standing up?
Oh, my God, you guys, having Gronk here is gonna be the best.
Kind of like those years when it was just Marley and me.
Wait, Marley, don't shake your wet fur in the middle of this fancy party.
I'm gonna lay down these work blueprints on the floor and I sure hope you don't walk across them with muddy paws.
Workout room, kegerator cellar, another workout room, and over here's a room that's just got a lit candle on a bale of hay.
My dumb wife won't let me have a room like that.
Check it out, my hot tub is filled with coffee.
And the pool is filled with my favorite food: soup with little shapes in it.
Why do you keep saying what things are sponsored by?
You've got your yoga pants moms, you got your mixed-race kids riding a pony, a confused Jerome...
Now, remember to tell customers that this honey is farm-to-table.
Wow, this is great, we've only been here an hour and we're almost totally sold out.
Just like Dan Cortese didn't see the end of the '90s coming.
Dan Cortese was the only thing in the entire world affected by Y2K.
When you know you have single coverage, do you give a hand signal to Brady, or is it just eye contact?
Well, no, I ask because sometimes you're being covered by a little guy, and then you and Brady'll look at each other and...
I ju... I just want to know if you and Brady have, like, a...
Whoa, that is top secret, but lean in and I'll tell you.
I think every dad's dream is taking his son's sloppy seconds.
God bless her, but genetically, they're a product of me blammin' onto a side of beef.
All right, since we sold out so fast, we've got to make these bees more productive, get them to make more honey.
This here is the same stuff that turned Barry Bonds' head into a prize-winning squash.
Okay. Well, how much are we supposed to give them?
Well, you can't fit a horse in this box, so I'd just use the whole thing.
Peter, this is exactly what I told you would happen!
Don't you think maybe it's time to call it a night?
Just like I helped kick the British out of America.
I know. That guy's more annoying than going to an Italian restaurant with someone who's been to Italy.
Hey, look, that bee is trying to get our honey.
Oh, God, do you think that's one of our steroid bees?
Okay, so a few of them had a bad reaction to...
I think maybe giving those bees steroids was a bad idea.
Gronk went to the University of Arizona, and everyone who went to the University of Arizona believes leprechauns are real.
And since Cleveland already owns a green suit and a top hat...
'Cause you're a pain in the ass to live next to!
You're a millionaire, you have the sweetest job in the world, you can do whatever you want.
Why you got to act like such an idiot all the time?
You see, I've been groomed for this my entire life.
Scoring touchdowns, making people laugh, punishing my body, enduring the pain.
You ask about the whys and the wherefores behind the boorish facade?
You guys mind if I eat while I beat you up?
Quick! We just have to get rid of the queen!
The bees instinctively stay with the queen, so if she's gone, they'll follow her!
Oh, well, thank goodness we finally have our neighborhood back.
Yeah, now maybe Wilson can move back in and give me homespun wisdom over the fence.
It's exhausting that you never just go with something I say.
Rob Gronkowski has been suspended from the Patriots following a failed drug test that showed evidence of steroids in his system.
The star athlete claims he has no idea how the banned substance got into his body.
Hey, do you think homeless people ever have sex with each other?
Oh, anything goes. Whatever you can fit under a tarp.
There's a major hot spot behind the Dumpster at The Cheesecake Factory.
Hey, what's up with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory?
I go there for dinner, not to shop for appliances.
Hey, you know what, guys? This right here, this rambling, boring conversation containing already-made-before observations, this could be a podcast.
Really? A podcast? Don't you have to be some sort of whiz kid to do those?
Uh, definitely not... anyone with a computer can make one.
Let's do a podcast from right here in the booth.
Awesome! We haven't done anything as a group since we went birdwatching.
It's known to swell its face to assert dominance when threatened.
Gin and whatever's in the bowl at the airport bar.
This is what happens when you lick your spilled latte off the steering wheel.
Hey, here's an idea, Chris... why don't you mind your own business?
You know, I did read that people could develop allergies to their pets.
I'm gonna go take a shower so I can blow my nose into my hands.
We got the equipment and the perfect business plan... give our show away for free, and tell no one how to find it.
Hey there, the Net, welcome to the first episode of Thanks for the Clamories.
I remember the first time I saw me a pair of 'cro's.
You can wash a shoe, but you can't really wash a lace.
To this day, every time I see a pile of dog doo,
So to answer the question, I'm gonna have to say both yes and no.
I'd like to thank our sponsor, the U.S. Postal Service.
When you want something expensive thrown on your porch and stolen, you want the U.S. Postal Service.
Yeah, if I wanted to hear a black guy ramble like a lunatic,
Yeah, I mean, that was worse than an Italian guy describing someone's sexuality.
Anyway, my brother Louie, he's a... he's a little off to the side, you know?
Hey, Stewie, thanks for letting me stay in your room.
Ooh, maybe we should watch that movie about Freud where Michael Fassbender repeatedly spanks
You know, I have a good feeling about this, Brian.
After all, you certainly can't be any worse than the last roommate I had.
Peter, where are you? You will wash your hands after you poop.
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose they ought to call me Jelly,
How many fourth-graders you think you could take at once?
I mean, obviously, if you had to fight against a million fourth-graders, you'd lose.
Like, what's the legitimate number of fourth-graders that you could successfully take on?
You could really mess up some kids with a chain from a swing.
All right, tell you what I'd do, I'd back into a bathroom stall, and just start kickin'. Dead! Dead! Dead!
Keep comin'! Dead! Give 'em a narrow entry point, make 'em come in single file.
People are gonna hate this. Peter, do something else, quick.
I don't know, it's just random garbage from my computer.
What the hell was that? We're supposed to be doing a podcast.
Peter, I don't know if you noticed, but the podcast was a disaster.
Yeah, and we were looking for something to do as a foursome.
I'm just a guy with a laptop and an inflated self-image.
Okay, but hold on. I got four quarters on Golden Tee.
Since some guy came in the Clam and heard my awesome jams and beats.
It is now safe to take off your wigs and be gay.
Oh, just some stuff I got out of my storage unit.
Look... I even brought Tom Sizemore's Game of Life. Sell rights to Saving Private Ryan residuals to buy a case of Coors Light. Steal your son's wallet while he's in the shower. Miss audition. Scoop someone's urine from Starbucks toilet to pass drug test.
Okay, let's make some noise for Deejay Peter and the Sound Slap!
Totally! And did you see Tom Sizemore in the bathroom with a ladle?
You've been playing the exact same song for 14 hours.
I-I should probably check with the guys and see what they...
Someone gave me a pill, and now all I want to do is feel your jacket.
I'm glad we hung out after you struck out with my mom.
You know, I could've used some help folding these fitted sheets.
You can't kick him out. He's my friend, and I live here, too.
I can't believe I ever wanted you here in the first place.
You're messy, you're loud, and thanks to you, we've got a recurring flea problem.
Peter, I was plowing this college chick last night, and I saw this flyer on her mini fridge.
All right, you know what? You guys were riding my coattails.
I carried you as long as I could, but Rob Kardashian's gonna be at this thing, so I got to be at my best.
It's not loud until you can feel your head bones.
We've always had each other's backs, like when we used to rob banks in lesser-known presidents masks.
Aw, damn it, Cleveland. Now we got to kill them all.
You've got to stop coming home so late if you can't get up in the morning, and...
All right, now how long has your husband smelled like this?
Oh, no. That's just from riding here in a hot car, but Dr. Hartman, what about his hearing?
This must be because of all that loud, blaring music he's been playing in those nightclubs.
What's going on? Can he fix it in time for me to deejay at the music festival?
Hey, guys, I don't know if you've heard, but I've gone deaf.
By the way, I ate all the L s. They're delicious.
You told us you were a big shot deejay and didn't want anything to do with us.
Um, the Electric Clam Festival's coming up, and I need your help.
Now that I'm deaf, I can't do it without you guys.
Because. You're a pain in the ass to live with.
I wanted to tell you that you can come back and sleep in our room.
Yeah. Turns out it was Peter who was causing my allergies.
He stuffed all our pillows with hay because he thought it looked comfortable in cartoons.
You know, maybe I wasn't such a great guy, either.
You know, even if we were bad roommates, we'll always be good friends.
I hope you and your ferret are happy in here together.
When you went deaf, did your other senses get better?
Chances are you'll be hit by a bus in the first three months.
You know, the worst part of all of this is I lost my friends.
I don't blame them for not wanting to help me.
Audible dot com presents, Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea, as read by Chelsea Handler.
Chapter one. Stuff I can fit in my lady place.
Brother brand, all-in-one fax, scanner, color copier with phone attachment...
Oh, yeah. Turns out it wasn't the loud music at the clubs that made me go deaf.
I just appreciate that you guys were there for me and tried to help me out.
Well, it's good to have you back to normal, Peter.
Ugh. This is gonna suck. are either air guitar or girls dancing to songs from Frozen.
Yeah, back in my day you had to be a triple threat to even get on that stage.
I could sing, dance, and guess the weight of any baby that was tossed to me.
Wake up, people, Monsanto is poisoning the world with frankenfoods, and we're letting it happen.
I am so sick of this being used as a platform
Hello okay, up next, here's Evelyn Fong, our 11-year-old high school junior.
And now, two football players are going to do something that only makes sense to the rest of the football team.
I got to take a leak. Daddy, you can't see.
All right, there's only so many seats on the bus.
One of you will have to sit next to me.
I'm glad you finally agreed to have the cataract surgery, daddy.
Well, tha-that's why the whole family came to support you.
And, uh, and meg went down to-to put money in the meter.
Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your vision will be impaired for a few weeks while you recover.
I recommend you and your wife have someone around to help you during this time.
Well, I'd love to help you, daddy, but Stewie's just been so fussy lately.
You'll be a hero... Just like King Arthur when he pulled the sword from the stone.
Aw, this is your big moment and I'm ruining it.
I'm learning violin. It's kind of like my new hobby.
What is this? It's a mason jar filled with layered sand.
Hey, you know what? Maybe you guys can learn an instrument, too,
Yeah, no offense, Muchacho, but I don't know if I have time for that, Muchacho.
I did play the Oboe in high school, and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.
But first you guys got to do one thing for me.
I want to feel like a person for a second.
Yes, it is. Now, sit your 99-percenter ass down and read me the comics.
Like I bought this jacket like what bugs bunny wears
Yeah, I've been practicing how to sit down in it.
I'm done with my bath. Put on this lady wig and help me out of the tub.
But first, grab that gold bond and powder my speed bag.
And that's not all... I also use it to throw boxes of frogs down on that church.
Boy, I could really get used to this rich guy stuff.
We got our first gig! Wow, a wedding... that's awesome!
Well, I was... that's how I got revved up to perform.
Uh, sir, that lady who came in and ate all the pies is back.
Damn it! I've been stuck on that page for two days.
And pour some of that scotch of yours to celebrate.
If Peter said that, you all would've lost your minds laughing.
It's just that at carter's house, if you don't want something heavy,
Ãtienne will whip you up an egg dish with some shallots and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.
I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri, but now you're back in the real world
Yeah, I guess I got used to being a little pampered over at carter's.
Whatever you're going to say next, I bet it's wrong.
I mean, once it became a friendship, he didn't want me working for him.
Ah, the bastards kicked me out 'cause I'm not good enough.
Oh, and they also taught me that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer,
So maybe you should, uh, you know, do the test.
I was in the hospital? You weren't there for it.
But if you're upset about the guys kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.
Guess I could've been a little more serious about it.
Maybe you could find a teacher who could help you learn,
And if you work at it and get a little better, they'll see you care about them.
Apply every five minutes, and you're good for five minutes.
We're going to a fund-raiser, and we share a bedroom.
And besides, I'm off to the spa down at the club.
Hey, did you also not wash your ass before getting in?
Hey, can I get a couple of extras of these plastic bags?
Oh, no, of course, you mean mad about the money.
I saw all your Instagrams on his helicopter like it was your helicopter.
The implication was that it was a regular part of your life.
Anyway, I know this makes me sound awful, but I almost wish
But you're not, so I don't want any part of this.
Um, he said you couldn't cut it as a member of one direction.
Okay, I'm pretty sure you're manipulating me, but let's go blind that old bastard.
Listen, Peter, we know you've been working hard on the violin, but more importantly, you're our pal,
And we'd like you to be back in the group.
We decided we'd rather be lousy with you than great without you.
Joe, no offense, but I'd prefer to hear it from someone else.
I'll be ready, unlike Lois getting dressed for a night out.
I'm the one who takes too long to get ready.
All right. It's 'cause I don't like the way I look.
As soon as he comes out, we spray this right in his eyes.
I did this, and it's made me realize that I was blinded by luxury and comfort,
But now I see that none of that matters if I don't...
Looks like we've learned a lot, and my face is better.
You sure you guys want me to play with you?
I'll say! The way you play, we'll have more gigs than we can handle.
Not a chance. Mr. Washy washy took all the joy out of this.
Oh, I thought you asked me what was going on with my sister.
That's right, Tom. Medieval Castle, which has been a staple of family entertainment and dining, is closing its doors.
The restaurant has gone into foreclosure, and will be up for auction tomorrow.
Yes, hard to believe a place where you eat with your hands next to piles of horse dung while untrained theater students fight with real swords could be drowning in lawsuits.
Guys, we should go to that auction tomorrow and buy it.
I mean, can you imagine if we had our own medieval castle?
I bet it'd be even more fun than when I went to White Castle.
Yeah, I'm not falling for that hot-oil massage bit again.
I must have jacked it up playing sports and not trying to dance like Beyoncé.
Then she'll drive me to the doctor, and I hate being in the car with her.
There it is, guys. Aw, this is gonna be awesome!
We just got to win this auction, and then we'll have our own castle.
Due to the presence of black mold, discarded half-eaten turkey legs, and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach,
I have been advised to move these proceedings along as quickly as possible.
Do I hear an opening bid for this majestic fiberglass castle facade, masking what was once a Midas Muffler shop?
We have 25 cents. Do I hear higher than 25 cents?
This paper bag, which could be full of money or my socks.
Two bits and a cardboard box, which may or may not contain a mystery bag.
Do I hear a higher bid from that James Bond villain over there?
Do I hear a much higher bid, followed by shocked murmuring?
Due to my 12:00 noon court appointment as part of a crippling child-custody battle with my horrific ex-wife,
I am saying going once, going twice, and awarding this condemned building to you...!
I should probably just invest this money in a 401-Gay.
I would call my sister about this if she were able to answer the phone.
Well, you know, in castle times, if you wanted something, you just took it.
I'm saying the four of us should storm that castle and take it for ourselves.
Should we do it with careful planning, or have another couple beers and then just go for it?
I checked with my mom, and she said it was cool with her if we wanted to sleep here tonight.
I'm gonna have to go home and get my pillow.
I've been in this location for 40 years, and never once have I broken a lamp.
So should I be aiming for an open window, or just arcing it over the wall?
I don't know, I've never seen the movie, just the Bryan Adams video.
Dr. Hartman, were you able to tell anything from Stewie's X rays?
Oh, no, am I gonna be a big-shoe, small-shoe guy?
He just needs to wear this brace for a while
Well, then, this will not be a refrigerator door year.
All right, this says if we don't get arrested for the next six months, the arson and mayhem charges will be dropped.
Actually, I use both and do, like, an Indian burn.
Yeah, thanks to Tinder, he's had a different girl every night this week.
It's an app for your phone where two strangers can hook up for a dirty liaison.
So you hit 'em on the head with your phone and knock 'em out?
No, you just swipe someone's picture, they come over, and you plow 'em.
Did you also know about easy sex on the Internet?
And how about you, douche bag music producer Scott Storch?
Okay, let's get me set up on this Tinder thing.
I can't wait to start getting laid at the push of a button.
Oh, yeah, I've been working on that. I wrote several long paragraphs describing my interests, some pet peeves, choice of wine, a couple of inspirational quotes, things I've learned from my cats...
You want a naked bathroom selfie covering your stuff with a fistful of $100 bills.
You already got a hit. And she sent a message.
Okay, it says Hey, and then a kissy face, and then, like, a saucy, smirking face, three balloons, and a locomotive.
Gawk at the Elephant Man. Let's get it all out.
I thought maybe you could be the first in line for snack today.
Now, if I could just find someone to wear this hero hat.
You know, like when a woman in a Porsche Cayenne isn't a complete bitch.
Yeah, take off your pants and sit on the coffee table.
Thanks to this thing, I was offered seats directly behind home plate at Fenway.
Um, it appears the back brace has corrected the spine very nicely.
So, I have the most money in the world, right?
Great. Can you make sure my hair looks like anyone in a nursing home?
Joe, golf shorts may not be the right look for you.
I haven't seen much of him since he discovered Tinder.
Swipe yes on Andrea. Swipe yes on all the lady faces.
Let's, uh, let's get a little light in here, huh, buddy?
That app's turned Quagmire into some kind of sex ghoul.
I don't have any friends, only sex people from the phone.
It looks like you haven't left this room in weeks.
Hey, come on, Quagmire, let's go for a walk, huh?
I can take my glass eye out if you want to try something different.
I got a good feeling about her. Maybe she's the one.
It's kind of cold, but we can do sweaters on, pants off.
I'm just gonna nudge it with my knee into this empty pizza box... and it's stuck to my knee.
All right, we got to just throw that phone away and end this once and for all.
He looks worse than I did after that day at the beach.
Yeah, there's plenty of nice women out in the real world to meet the old-fashioned way.
All from a sex app you use on your phone
You know, a surprising number of them live near the airport.
Banging every Tom and Dick and Jack and Jill and Joan
'Cause we're not allowed to have an orgy through our phone
Yes, is it possible to get Showtime for free for the next, like, two hours to see if I like it?
It's got to be from wearing that damn brace all the time.
Your neck must have atrophied so much it can no longer support your head.
Let me just watch Jennifer's Body and we'll go right there.
Oh, nothing that can't be fixed with a string of chili pepper Christmas lights.
I wore that brace for the next five years of my life.
Then it was just, Get off the swing, you Christmas turd.
I'm fine. I'm fine, it... oh, h... oh, hey, uh, you on Tinder?
No. Look, I'm not trying to pick you up, it just seemed like you were upset about something, and I know when I'm upset, it's nice to let someone else in.
Come on, Quagmire, this is a real girl right in front of you.
Are you really gonna listen to a phone over me?
This is exactly why you got into the over-the-shoulder advice business.
Give up on your attempt to convince real Quagmire to not use Tinder, and to instead have sex with this woman who's right in front of him.
I'm just saying, you used to have skills that no one else had, that took you years to hone.
I just feel like my penis shouldn't be alone tonight.
Yep, he's scumming it up in the real world again.
And all it took was for us to hire that $200 dirty prostitute to pretend to be a nice lady in a bar.
I'm just glad she's a prostitute and not that lady murderer that's been all over the news.
Hi, I'm that prostitute you guys hired to seduce your friend.
I have to have sex with your housekeeper to save humanity.
Every second I'm not having sex with a housekeeper, robots are killing people in the future.
Peter, it's me, and you're an adult man drinking in a bar.
The pantry down at the station needed new shelf paper.
Well, that, and I'm also in charge of the office gerbil.
And let me tell you, Lieutenant Nibbles is quite a handful.
You used to be this badass cop out there on the street, busting heads and keeping us safe.
Well, it may not sound exciting, but I play an important role.
I go through all the body cam footage and take out all the parts where the cops go pee-pee.
Eh, not erasing, sort of cutting them together into a funny montage we show on birthdays.
Speaking of which, Flannigan's got the big four-oh coming up.
Man, you guys think Joe's as happy as he says he is, just doing all that desk work?
Ugh, she just put her tampons on top of the bread.
Mom, can I go barehand raisins from the bulk aisle?
Okay, but if you get caught, just say, oopsie-poopsie, like a simpleton.
Excuse me, ma'am, your little girl dropped her teddy bear.
He's actually a little boy, but thank you very much.
I don't know, maybe she saw you try to throw that feather in the yard yesterday.
Hey, since we're in a cop car, let's talk about our hunches and how something doesn't add up.
All units, reports of a drug deal in progress at Fifth and Maple.
No can do, I got to go to the station and tidy up the bulletin board.
Peter, there's a lot you don't understand about police work.
Nice try, scumbag, but I got your squishy drugs right here.
Peter, hand me my gun and get out of here!
And I can't go back to my job as a magician's assistant.
Yeah, that's, uh, that's why I wanted to talk to you before the show.
Come on, Stewie, are you still hung up about that woman at the grocery store thinking you were a girl?
I just thought it'd be good to take up a sport.
You don't have to play football to prove you're a boy.
Larry, I'm afraid you only have three months to live.
You had no business participating in that raid at Fifth and Maple.
You brought down one of the biggest drug rings in Quahog.
My wife puts on my pants one leg at a time.
It's hard to believe you did that all by yourself.
Yep, did it all by myself, I did, I did.
That's weird phrasing, but I'll tell you this, Swanson, you keep up this kind of work, there'll be no more grocery runs for you.
You know, I was just thinking about how much fun we had the other day, and wondered if you'd want to join me for another ride-along.
Well, yeah, but I-I thought you said I couldn't do that
Hey, and-and can we go slow up to a homeless guy and go joop-joop and see what he does?
So, what do you say? You think you're up to it?
But once he sees how big the other kids are, he'll back out.
Okay, well, believe me, there's there's more to him than you think.
And if you see that Tyler, take his knee out.
Okay, I guess we'll see who's got the toughest kid here.
Our top story tonight: local news anchor too professional to laugh at penis poked through hole in cue card.
But first, earlier today at city hall, the mayor honored a hero cop who has foiled a string of recent crimes.
Good afternoon, we had a budget meeting that ran long, so I'm gonna eat my lunch while I hold this press conference.
I'm gonna now shake this up like a lady in your office.
Okay, while the dressing does its magic, let's honor Officer Joe Swanson, who single-handedly cut crime in Quahog by 75%.
Officer Swanson, as thanks from a grateful city, please accept this Certificate of Merit.
And with that, I hereby declare this hero cop open!
Damn it, I can't believe Joe's hogging all the credit.
So the aliens have come to Earth to destroy all mankind.
I mean, he can come out for limp handshakes at the end of the game, but I can't play him. He's too little. Little?
Let's see if it looks bigger when I throw a Sprite at it.
Come on, Stewie, give your dog something to post on Facebook!
You do me an honor, Lieutenant, but my dance card is full.
Officer Swanson, as you requested, here's a big stack of all the cases you cracked.
Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead and brood over a photo of the girl whose case was the one I couldn't solve.
Your '70s sweater and feathered hair let people know this is a cold case.
I saw you on TV, hogging all the credit for my police work.
Look, I told you, I need you to be a silent partner on this.
The truth is I could get in a lot of trouble.
Oh, I see. You need me to be the bad cop who kicks all the ass and then I'm supposed to be quiet about it?
Yeah? Well, maybe I accidentally reveal that you're not the hero everyone thinks you are and that you've been letting your neighbor do all kinds of cop stuff.
All right, I'm here. But why did you want me to bring this?
I'll tell you why. You're getting all the credit for my police work, so I want stuff from you.
I want a minute in your house with this shopping cart, like Supermarket Sweep.
Peter, you expect me to let you ransack my house?
Well, unless you'd rather I spill the beans to the chief about who's been doing your dirty work.
I don't, I don't care, I just want to know.
Actually, I already receive The New York Times, and I always enjoy finishing the crossword puzzle.
Well, on TV if somebody gets hit on the head, you hit them a second time and that gets them back to normal.
You see, what a concussion is is the impact of brain matter on the inside of the skull.
That's why you sometimes hear this nonsense about, Oh, let's just give them better helmets.
I wonder what's going on in that little head of his.
I didn't hear you crying in the shower this morning.
You've been getting all those commendations and my online handmade lip balm business is really taking off.
Any available unit, we have a report of an armed robbery in progress.
Well, uh, maybe you and I could do one last bust for old time's sake.
Yes! All right, let's do it. Let's go be heroes.
Is there a skeleton with a wig that can drive me home?
There is a room where you can go in and just get free people.
Look, I'm really sorry I let you get hurt, Stewie.
I just have to accept that I'm not a man and I'm never going to be one.
That's ridiculous. You can't let what one woman says in a grocery store define who you are.
Yeah, I wanted to check in on this tough little guy. Tough little guy?
It takes a real man to take a hit like that.
But if I were you, I'd stay off the field.
Recent brain scan studies have shown that brain injuries are directly linked to dementia and suicides in former players!
You can play the music louder but you can't silence the truth!
You know, maybe you had it in you all along.
Wow. I guess I just got ground down by years of people treating me like an errand boy, and I just let them walk all over me.
You know, you were a real pain in the butt as a partner, but you helped me find myself again.
Excuse me, do you have any Tab soda I can bring back to the sex dungeon where I've been held captive for decades?
Well, if you like movies in HD, then frozen pixels, then HD again, the answer is yes.
And if you love the golden year of movies, 2003, then we might have some of what you're looking for.
Netflix Streaming: buffer for 20 minutes, then watch 35 minutes of a movie with Jason Statham.
Oh, look what came, the free DVD from my PBS pledge.
Peter, trust me, you of all people could really learn something from this.
Huh. Says here that Colon Health Magazine gave it two thumbs in.
America is gorging itself on processed food, creating an obesity epidemic.
We've abandoned natural foods for chemicals, additives and refined sugars.
At this rate, this is what the future will look like.
Those are flying cars, but the people in them are too fat.
For more, go to our website at double-u double-u double-u dot PBS dot com.
That's www dot, the word double-u three times, the word dot, PBS, the word dot again, the word com, dot com.
Well, that's it, from now on, we're eating healthy around here.
It sure didn't work for Droopy Dog when he got that facelift.
Please study my brain so that others don't suffer as I have.
And Esther, I'm so sorry you ripped your perineum doing the Hokey Pokey.
It means your ankles, calves, and thighs are all the same thickness.
How would you like to try out for the roller derby team?
Here. Take my card. I am a registered sex offender.
This is the biggest surprise since the last M. Night Shyamalan movie.
I went to Whole Foods today and got this recipe from an extremely thin man with a giant Adam's apple.
Nope, I don't eat foods that sound like karate words.
It's very nutritious, and it even helps keep you regular.
I poop once a week for an hour and a half.
I wear a headband and it's soaked when I'm all done.
No problem. And I'm gonna take some pictures of the other athletes, if you don't mind.
You might not know this about me, but I am a bit of a shutterbug.
Okay, now, last year we were tricked by a couch on a dolly with wheels, so if any of you is a couch on a dolly with wheels,
Well, we need five for a team and there's five of you here, so congratulations.
And then I'm gonna fall asleep watching transvaginal mesh lawsuit commercials.
And you should never ask that unless you're sure, by the way.
And let's crack a Cadbury Egg over the whole thing.
I can't believe Randy Quaid gets to eat like this every day.
We watched Tyler Perry's Food Kills, which is the same movie except it stars black folks you've never heard of and white folks you don't hear from anymore.
But, yeah, now Donna is forcing me to eat healthy.
I always get confused, is Donna the wife, or is Roberta the wife?
I don't know, man, can I have some of that sandwich?
Man, my wife won't let me eat any of that stuff.
Tell you what, I'll give you ten bucks for that thing.
Huh, if I sell two sandwiches for $10 each, that equals... money.
Whoops, I stopped thinking about math and started thinking about baby-man Billy Corgan being sad at Disneyland.
This, Lois, is my new food truck, specializing in all the delicious, unhealthy foods that you won't let me eat.
'Cause you don't let me eat what I want to eat and that... and, uh, I am super dizzy and there might be a gas leak in this thing.
Second, uh, mostly hamburgers where the buns is jelly donuts.
Look, I'm happy for the business, but drinking that on your knees is... it's putting a hat on a hat.
It's exactly the stuff I'm trying to get you not to eat.
Yeah, but people like this food. It makes them happy.
I mean, you can eat sprouts and vegan crap your entire life and still get devoured by Gremlins and-and-and none of it matters.
So you're saying you shouldn't take care of yourself because you might get devoured by Gremlins?
You want the can of chili dumped on top or on the side?
Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard the chili flies into my mouth like Popeye.
You got it. Let me put on my bandana, fire up my very loud what generator, and get cooking.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first bout of the season, the Quahog Thugs versus the Medford Dump Cakes.
This season we're brought to you by Barry's Note Cards. When you need to remind yourself of the sponsor, use Barry's Note Cards.
Wow, newcomer Meg Griffin is lighting up the track with some amazing moves. Amazing? Damn right, amazing.
Make some noise if you're mixing prescription drugs with alcohol!
Wow. This is a lot more physical than I thought.
Yes, sir. Everything's very expensive because you're paying for it on an iPad.
And just sign by dragging your bare finger across this thing I use to masturbate.
Thank you, please make sure to bang your head on that low-hanging thing.
'Cause I watched how rough it was out there the other day, and I got a little worried for you.
I mean, all it would take is one bad hit to do permanent damage.
But you know, in ways besides the way, you know, they normally bleed.
Yeah, I got it, Stewie, but I'm telling you, Meg, something bad is going to happen.
Like when you give a young athlete too much money.
Come on, I spent the whole day making the house smell like farts.
All right, I got a bowl of cereal that's M&M's and Dr. Pepper?
You kids get in the house and eat the healthy dinner I prepared, and Peter, you, too.
I don't want to eat your garbage food. All right?
Now can you go inside and get me some Pop Rocks?
'cause I don't want you or your food in the house.
Whoops. I stopped thinking about the truck and started thinking about Amazon woman
Not bad. I see you got a Hooters calendar in here.
How do you get anything done with those rocking knockers staring at you?
And I'm not going back in that house and listen to Lois tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.
I guess I see where some of your anger comes from.
I don't think so. I'm hurt pretty bad, like that time I was running with scissors.
Here you go. And if you'd like to put your e-mail on our sign-up list,
Holy crap. This is the day we've been waiting for.
We said we're gonna stand in our front yards and wave as it goes by so we're on the street view.
I knew this would happen. You're too fat to get out.
Jeez, I hope I don't end up stuck in here like Winnie the Pooh.
Perhaps you should push with your shoulder and not your fist?
Hey, did that big boomba boomba nurse come in here?
Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry you got hurt like this.
Roller derby was the best thing that ever happened to me.
I finally felt like I was good at something, I made friends... but seeing you like this, I realize you were right.
No, Meg. I got hurt because I didn't belong out there, but you do.
Now get back to that rink and help your team win the championship it deserves.
I think she did all right, but no one will know for sure because halfway through everyone stopped to watch some fat kid who was killing it on Dance Dance Revolution.
So tonight, we say to the yellow-billed marsh finch... you're extinct.
Tom, I'm standing here outside a Spooner Street home, where a local business owner has apparently eaten himself into his own food truck.
Mr. Griffin, is this performance art or, uh, some sort of political statement?
Well, I'm kind of ticked about condoms in porn, but this is unrelated.
Yeah, it's every girl's dream to have her husband hoisted out of a food truck in a horse harness.
I'm a big tub of lard, and you have every reason to be ashamed of me.
I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you, and I'm concerned about your health.
I want you around for as long as I'm around.
I guess I could do without eating so much junk, but I could never do without you.
Peter had steamed vegetables and brown rice that evening, then ate like crap for the rest of his life.
Hey, guys, I didn't know you were coming to the church raffle.
I thought Donna said we were going to the church waffle.
And we're only here for the fantasy weekend at Fenway park.
Oh, yeah, the winner and a friend get to hang out and practice with retired Red Sox players and then play in a real game, right on the field at Fenway.
Oh, my god, that's always been a dream of mine!
Well, that and tuning a guitar in front of a live audience.
This was in perfect tune when they handed it to me.
Next up, our fantasy weekend for two at Fenway park.
I like it when people say your name out loud!
Well, then maybe you shouldn't have named it such a fun word.
So I was just baking a coffee cake, and I figured I'd bring it over,
Well, I was just thinking, you have that extra ticket, maybe you'd want to...
I've got that murdered jogger's Discman you wanted last week.
Guys, look, I know you all want to go, but I-i need a little more time to figure this out.
Like what to do with that big watermelon I bought.
Griffin, I just wanted to tell you that's a great outfit.
Whichever one of them you bring to Fenway, the other two will be mad at you.
Those guys are all way better than me at baseball.
They'd just show me up and ruin it for me.
She doesn't care about baseball, and that way nobody gets their feelings hurt.
I'm gonna get 'em all, I'm gonna get 'em all,
I-I'm going for shopping, the hotel spa, and two days of being away from you life-sucking turds.
I'm in high school, and you're still putting the dog in charge?
But I thought you were gonna dress like a baseball player.
I'm the type of player who arrives at the stadium in a suit.
Okay, now you heard mom say I'm in charge, so I just want to lay a few ground rules. Yeah.
I promise we're gonna have fun, but there will be a schedule, uh-huh.
Just to keep everything running smoothly. Sure, got to have boundaries.
And I may assign a chore or two, that's great, Meg.
Because it's actually more fun sounds like you got it all worked out.
You want to hand me some cash in front of the other men so you feel powerful?
Instead, why don't you just take my minions discover card?
We've never had a lady come out for this before.
Oh, no, no, that's my wife, she's just dropping me off.
And besides, if you leave, the teams will be lopsided.
So, as your coach, I insist you stay and play with us.
What do I think about sharing fantasy baseball camp with my wife?
Hey, would you mind standing next to a star of today?
David Ortiz, will you pick him up like a baby?
Now let me put this baby bonnet on his head and a cigar in his mouth.
And over there's where I threw a d-cell battery at Jose Canseco.
Yep, guess I can cross this one off my bucket list.
Peter, what the hell did you do to the house?
I know, it seems pretty lame until you realize I'm 58.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go lick the foot of a fleshy, pale woman for real sex 34.
Rupert, what do you think of this fan fiction I wrote? Diego pressed Dora against the wall, her bosom heaving, her hot Latina breath on his face.
I press my butt against the wall and dook on it?
You're messing with my schedule, so I'm giving you wall poo.
I take abuse from everybody around here, but I am not gonna take it from you.
Now sit here until I say you can get up.
Guess you don't have a lot of babes out here.
She gave me a time-out and she made me sit in this chair.
Stewie, Lois put Meg in charge, and, honestly, once I knew that,
All right, that's it, I'm not just gonna sit here and see what that psycho does next.
I shall fashion a makeshift ladder with my diaper genie entrails, shimmy down to the yard, and I'm free.
The trick, Chris, is thinking of the wand as an extension of your arm.
Wow, I can't believe I'm pretend bowling with a dog on drugs!
Wow, it's nice they put on a banquet for you.
In fact, their ex-wives are having a banquet next door with their money.
I-is it 'cause of how pink you turn when you run?
We've been saving a spot at the head table for you with all the hall-of-famers.
This is the one night of the year they let me out of the scoreboard.
Oh, I don't know if I deserve to sit at the head table.
You're the only one here who doesn't have a fistful of baseball cards for us to sign.
Now, come on, Lois, we've got you sitting right between Pedro Martinez and Ted Williams' severed head.
There's a special place in hell for whoever's responsible for me ending up like this.
I forgot, he's been in a time-out for six hours.
I even held up my arm with my other hand.
That is the most noticeable way to raise your hand.
Okay, Griffin, you go out there and be the base runner.
Okay, Lois, catch the ball, and if your foot comes off the bag, just tag Peter on any part of his body.
Yeah, an idiot who's gonna show up on Sportscenter tonight.
Coming up after the break, we'll have highlights of the playoff game between...
My only medical training is to say walk it off.
Okay, I'm gonna go fake-use the phone in the dugout.
Nothing. I was just trying to play hard, like Pete rose.
I bet you a thousand bucks I have a drinking problem.
You think I'll be back in time for the game?
It's supposed to be a fun day out here, and you go nuts and break your wife's leg.
It's not my fault, I'm all hopped up on hard baseball card gum.
Like those poor guys who had to come up with a new ad campaign for subway.
You know what I'm getting sick of saying? My husband did this to me, but it's not what you think.
And then when I saw everyone giving you all that attention,
I was always the fat, uncoordinated kid that nobody wanted on their team.
And I was excited that for one weekend, if I could just step on that field and get a hit at Fenway park,
I could erase all that and feel like a champ for the first time in my life.
And to me and our kids, you will always be a winner.
I don't need to play in some stupid fantasy baseball game.
You're gonna play in that game, and you're gonna get that hit.
And when you do, we're all gonna be there to cheer you on.
Peter, these guys have been sexually harassing me since the second I got here.
Either you play, or every one of these Red Sox are going to jail... even Ted Williams.
This is the number-one fear of only being a head.
Brian, do you always listen to the Sirius XM preview station?
Yeah, I'm thinking about pulling the trigger, but they make you sign, like, a two-year...
Uh, your father broke my leg out of jealousy, but that didn't ruin our honeymoon, and it's not gonna ruin this.
So listen, I want all you guys to drive up to Boston this afternoon to see your father play in the big game.
Mom, but we promised Stewie we'd perform a puppet show for him later today.
Oh, you can perform it for all of us up here in Boston.
Crap! Now we got to find Stewie and write a puppet show.
Look, just because it's already been written doesn't mean it's not fresh.
Who, Meg? - Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean, and I don't ever want her to be in charge of me.
Oh, Stewie, I'm really sorry I left you in that time-out.
I love you very much, and I'm so happy you're home.
'cause I was too embarrassed to get nude in the locker room, so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.
Ladies and gentlemen, now batting for the Boston Red Sox, Peter Griffin!
And he's been out in the blazing sun for two days.
No. He told his wife there's juices in the hot dogs.
Well, I'm sorry, I got no choice but to call for a complete muscle failure.
I ran like a champion that day, pushing through the pain of two torn hamstrings and a ruptured groin, to leg out the hit at Fenway park
But nobody noticed, 'cause the account manager from B of a who was playing third base had a massive coronary trying to field my crappy little nubber.
The hit was amazing, but what made it even better was that my family was there to share the moment with me.
Every kid in school had to write a list of five reasons Principal Shepherd is cool and then have their parents sign it.
One time, I saw him pee in a urinal with his hands on his hips.
Why would the principal make all the students do that?
James Woods High will be hosting a cross-country meet, which also happens to be where Lorraine has threatened to take my children, across the country.
All right, finally some peace and quiet, so I can buckle down and get some writing done.
Listen to this. Say, It's all been a pack of lies.
Just do it! Just say, It's all been a pack of lies. It's all been a pack of lies.
And then, the next night, he invited the watching guy to be in the front row of his concert so he could sing it right to him and they could arrest the guy!
Really? Why wouldn't he have just helped the guy who was drowning?
I don't know, I think he was on a bridge or something.
Like, he could see it, but he couldn't get there in time.
Wait, if he just watched, doesn't that also make him a little guilty?
Look, I'm not saying we wouldn't bring Phil Collins in for questioning.
Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel to The Old Man and the Sea.
But I can't get anything done. It's so damn loud around here.
Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway used to complain about. This Spanish Civil War is just too loud.
No, I mean, it might sound silly, but I used to daydream that by now
I'd have my own place by a lake somewhere, an oasis where I could go to write.
Oh, like a B and B? That could be fun.
I'm talking about you and me opening a B and B.
Can't be any worse than when I was on the Night's Watch.
Hey, guys, you all want to say the oath again?
I'm the boring storyline of the fat guy that's watching that girl.
Very funny. Who put the Ark of the Covenant in here?
Students, faculty and staff of James Woods High, does anyone know how to push down the backseat of a Highlander?
I know I can make a bed in there, I just don't know how.
I just listened to two hours of butt-dialed sex between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.
Man, I still can't get over how perfect this place is.
I know, it's going to be such a darling B and B.
Well, we don't have a boiler, but I can't wait to see what you've done in the cellar.
Oh, also, please rub the H and the C off all the knobs, so people won't know what the hell's going on.
I want the first four minutes of every shower to be confusion and anger.
Let's call to order this emergency meeting of the school board regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.
I know a number of our students have felt traumatized by the events of this week, and we take those concerns very seriously.
However, I was informed earlier today that she was found dead in her car.
Therefore, the board is seeking a parent volunteer to serve as interim principal until a permanent replacement can be found.
Hey, Lois, maybe I should do it. I've always wanted a job where I can let my dandruff go wild.
Yeah, no offense, Peter, but I don't know if you should be running a school.
Wonderful. Why don't you come on up and introduce yourself.
All right. James Woods High cheerleaders, give me a hand!
I go pop, pop, fizz, fizz, oh, how sweet it is.
Oh, your father says he doesn't need it anymore now that he's a high school principal.
Oh, my God, he's not really doing that, is he?
As a principal, I like to start each morning with a reference from last century.
Too late. I've already been practicing giving students awkward and uncoordinated high fives.
All right, I got to get to work by 7:40,
That's weird, that's the fifth couple to check out after only an hour.
Wait, I'm sorry, weren't you just here a moment ago with a different man... oh, crap.
Stewie, we have a problem. The only people checking in are here to have sex with prostitutes.
Well, then why are they all signing the guest book and writing quaint things like, Railed Crystal good. Oh...
I mean, it's more obvious than when George Takei was in the closet.
Three years too late, but right on time for a principal.
And making no less sense than it did when it was current.
How about we all do an expertly choreographed lip-dub to a popular song.
You see, if our guests insist on bringing prostitutes into our B and B, we might as well provide the women, too.
I'm sure. The answer is no, so don't bother flashing a wad of money, because there's no way I'm gonna change my answer in the middle of this sentence...
Okay, maybe we could try it out and see how it goes.
Ha-ha! I'm telling you, that dog is very easily persuaded.
Now let's see what's going on at the old high school.
When Borat was making announcements over the P.A. this morning, that was me.
I'll knock your teeth down your throat and out your butt, you little bastard!
Oh, you think that's funny, him spilling juice all over the floor?
This is gonna make people's sneakers sticky, and then we're gonna have to listen to... all day!
Yeah, Meg, now that your dad's the principal, you could finally have power over the bullies.
And if you see Miss Millikan, tell her I said, Hey, what's up?
I mean the way you handled those guys that were picking on me.
Really? I felt like I kind of lost my cool there.
Yeah. In fact, if you're gonna lead this school, you've got to know that kids need discipline.
There's gonna be some changes around here, and what better way to show you I'm serious than to smash a desk with a baseball bat?
Tell her I'm on the bats and to come get me.
Loads of people fought for that thing, including yours truly.
The four of us got together last night, and we came up with a list of 11 students and two teachers that you need to do something about.
He wouldn't kiss Ruth at the Sadie Hawkins dance, even though she bought him dinner before at Walt's Roast Beef.
Well, I don't see how that's got anything to do...
I'm gonna take down all these punks, just like I did in my
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this as gently as I can, but it appears that someone's rectum fell out on the stairs.
But let's just agree on a rule that if your rectum falls out on the stairs, it's on you to pick it up.
Our day has just begun, and there's a line out the door.
This is a hell of a lot easier than when I delivered pizza in New Orleans.
And for Jason O'Neil, maybe you could pants him during an assembly.
I, um... I'm just helping Dad with his schedule for tomorrow.
Huh. Well, I got to admit I was skeptical, but it sounds like things are going pretty well down there.
Uh, he's just saying he wants to use his key to drive me to school tomorrow in his car.
Peter, what exactly are you doing down at that school?
I'm doing a great job, like when I was a pro football kicker.
We just realized we can keep all the money, take your house, and kill you if you try to do anything about it.
All right, we're just gonna step outside and figure out a counter.
Hello, I'd like to report a brothel operating on Route 6, near Round Hill Road.
You want to eat mangled raisin bread across the street and watch the cops raid the place?
Oh, I bet he's delivering those marmalade jars we ordered.
If you don't sign for it, it has to go back.
Most of what America is now is just boxes going back and forth.
Jeff Banfield, I'd like you to please come down here, take your pants off and sit.
Just go, Jeff, or he'll start hitting that trash can with a spoon again.
Yes, but then I went on a sex trip to Thailand, and I banged all the goofy right out of me.
Because what you and your father have been doing is wrong.
You stood up for all the kids who get picked on.
Wow, so... so you think I did a good job being principal?
And next time I want to get back at your bullies,
As a grown man beating up teenagers in a parking lot.
I can't wait to get everyone else's body water in my mouth.
My friend, I'm an adult who works at a water park.
No going down headfirst, and wait till I say it's okay.
Hey, idiot, you got to wait till the guy says go.
Excuse me, do you think you can help me out?
Sure, just let me do an awkward, extremely unattractive pool walk over to you.
I think I may have seen you put it in your shorts.
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.
Hey, if you want something, you've got to go for it.
Just like the fat man did when he changed his name.
Yes, there's a soiled pair of Ferrari underwear in the men's room trash.
There's diarrhea all over the front seat of your PT Cruiser.
Also, I was wondering if there's any chance you'd maybe want to go out with me sometime.
Oh, Chris, that's sweet, but I don't think you'd want to go out with me.
Oh, boy, I haven't been this excited since our trip to Philadelphia.
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
You are? Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say...
Oh, Isabella's coming by, and we're gonna take the kids to the park.
Wow, you two are spending a lot of time together.
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl who's... had so much experience?
Like, maybe she's got some city miles on her voo-voo.
I just want to make sure you're not getting in over your head.
Well, I'm sure someone's already been in there deeper than that, Lois.
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
So, in other words, this could have waited till the morning?
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting back into the country as soon as I can.
What are you gonna do, just leave the babies with Consuela?
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
We secondary e-mail people use to sign up for porn sites.
The whole reason I left Mexico was to give them a better life.
I mean, I'm no expert at this sort of thing, but...
But I can't ask you to take care of my children.
I'm gonna call you Juan, and I'm gonna call you Two.
What makes you think you can take care of two babies?
I don't know, I've seen her take care of them.
Look, I made a promise to Isabella, and I'm gonna keep it.
Now, if you'll excuse me, these two need to eat.
There's no way Chris is gonna be able to take care of two babies.
Well, maybe he should have thought of that before he opened his slut legs.
Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
Like when I worked at that all-night diner from that painting.
They kicked me out of the war for kissing a guy.
All right, guys, nothing but the best for you two, so I got you all-organic, non-GMO, no-hormone food.
Looks like we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's and hope that future science will save us.
They don't even know it's a crime, they just know their parents aren't there.
How can I take them... when I was never here?
I could just take some time off school and get a job.
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on, maybe Chris getting a job's not the worst idea.
I mean, I made pretty good money when I hosted that confusing game show.
All right, Phil, come stand by me, it's Ashley's turn.
Ashley, go ahead, pick an answer, find a question, spin the table, and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.
Forget it, I will not allow you to drop out of school.
If Isabella can't get here to take her kids back, we'll just have to bring them to her.
I mean we're going to Mexico so we can give these kids back to their mother.
Look how winded he is from doing that one spin.
If you kids are good, we'll bring you back a tangled marionette.
Especially since we're gonna do it to the wrong stock footage.
What in the Mind of Mencia are you doing here?
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
This is no place for Isabella to raise a family.
I didn't want you to have to raise those babies yourself.
But as a mom, I don't know if I can in good conscience leave this family here.
We'll just have to smuggle her and her babies back in.
All you got to do is say dyed black eyebrows into the wind, and he appears.
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk of smuggling me and my children across the border?
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Last time he went out of town, I sat on his eggs for him.
Sorry, Lois, can't leave the eggs till Quagmire gets back.
Well, I guess I haven't seen that mongoose in a while.
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
I put my business card in a fishbowl at an El Torito.
Does it have to be during the week, because I...
Boy, I can't believe there'd be corrupt cops in Mexico.
Yeah, Donald Trump was right: his daughter is a hot piece of ass.
Uh, you guys, don't panic, but there's a couple of coyotes over there.
I know, but, wow, did you see how Chris took care of those kids?
Up till now, the only thing he could take care of was my traffic tickets.
Chris is injured, and we're completely out of food and water.
I'm so thirsty, I'd be willing to drink anyone's pee.
You know, I just wanted to do the right thing, but now we're all gonna die.
S-So, wait, so we walked right across the border and didn't even know it?
I mean, politics aside, we can all agree, that is a problem.
And thanks for talking us on that little detour to Dollywood.
I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.
Because you care about them, just like you care about Isabella.
And if you want to continue to date her and be a part of those kids' lives,
You know how many times I had you kids in the oven, just daring myself to turn it on?
Well, thanks for trusting me to figure it out for myself.
I'm too young to be taking on this much responsibility.
But I know someday you will make an incredible father.
Got a birthday coming up for someone you absolutely hate?
Why not tell them to go screw themselves by sending a giant Fruit Bouquet?
With just a few clicks, you'll be able to send someone 14 pounds of unwanted decorative produce that will go bad within an hour of arrival!
How about a hard green wedge or a slime-glazed melon ball?
Order now and make someone feel guilty about throwing it straight into the trash six hours later.
How would you find out the name of the actual actress who plays the AT&T chick?
I left a list of hot commercial girls on the refrigerator.
I guess I'm not the only person with a useless husband.
I still don't understand why we couldn't take my last name.
Well, my last name helps keep a roof over our head and pays for your hobby.
If I had to change one more diaper, I was gonna lose it.
I mean, what would our husbands do if they had to change their own diapers?
Yes. I received all your letters, and I do like your mustache.
Thank you, but those won't work on your fat arms.
You're eating a pie on the toilet, aren't you, Cleveland?
And we'll give you $500 if you can sing Britney Spears' I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.
If this is the fracking people, I have made it clear that I am 100% on board.
You've never met me before and probably don't even know I exist, but you're my father.
How'd you get this number? Don't you ever call here again!
Like when he was an NFL announcer and had to pretend he cared about the shows after the game.
Hey, after the game, keep it here for an all-new Madam Secretary.
Tonight, Madam Secretary faces an international crisis in Pakistan, while her teenage daughter faces her own crisis finding a date for the prom.
Yup. I finally peed that chunk of poo off the side of the bowl.
You know the one you've been yelling at me about?
Nope. So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?
You know, where-where I just lie there and arch my hips a little bit and breathe like a dying whale?
All right, well, just in case, I'll be upstairs getting into my boxers and black socks.
Do you think it's possible he actually has an illegitimate child?
I don't know, but something's going on, because I'm telling you, he lied right to my face.
It sounds like you're just making up stories about your competitors.
And that's where we get the expression gay as a bag of popcorn.
Oh, my God. I-I got to follow him, find out where he's really going.
You're not on the insurance, and I don't think that...
Peter Griffin, you tell me what's going on right now.
No, I wanted to pay for dial-up modem impression classes. See?
Yeah, I'd-I'd almost forgotten about it, but then last night, I get this call from a woman who says she's my daughter.
I figured if I do have a kid out there,
I want to make sure they're not giving out my information.
I'm sorry I tricked you, but if you do have a child out there, isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?
I mean, as long as we're here, maybe you should sign a consent form.
Okay, I took a leak into this can of Busch Light without spilling.
Wherever someone has a banner for a football team as a curtain, I'll be there.
People need a concert to go to after the water park.
Yeah, I hope you don't mind the drop-in, but the, uh, the sperm bank said it was okay to contact you.
Wow, I guess, I guess I just didn't expect this so soon.
We're all your children. We came from your semen. Semen.
Only once, but I had just seen Uma Thurman in Beautiful Girls, so it was kind of a ka-blamo.
You ever seen those videos where they put Mentos in Diet Coke?
Uh, listen, I want all of you to know how happy we are to meet you.
Just 'cause they're my kids and they all look like me doesn't mean we have anything in common.
I've never felt proud of any of my children until now.
For years, I have dreamed of one day traveling from Bavaria to play the accordion for my birth family.
Oh, I get that because this comedy has just made it to Germany.
We have been Orphan Black-ed and you soon will be dead.
I've been looking around this whole house for something to nibble on.
You always say that, and I'm the one who ends up feeding him and walking him and doing all the clean up.
Excuse me, I'm a candidate for a doctorate in Classics at Wesleyan.
You almost dipped one of your yabbos in the marinara.
You're the first person who looks anything like my husband who's offered to help in any way.
I got to tell you, it's so strange, you look so much like Peter when I first met him.
Well, I do have tiny blue weights in my garage.
Then why... why are you still in your pajamas and bathrobe?
Is that why that sad Shel Silverstein blob is following you around?
Anyway, we didn't really get a chance to finish our conversation yesterday, and I thought maybe we could grab some lunch together.
Huh. That would give me a reason to get dressed today.
See, this is why no one ever wants to you.
Sorry I drew so many Nazi symbols on the place mat.
I just wish we hadn't gone to a kosher restaurant.
Me and some of my kids are going to the movies.
I didn't know what he ate, so I gave him nothing.
All right, everybody bring your phones so we can text each other during the movie.
Oh, Brian, Larry and I sort of crossed a line yesterday.
I don't know, he's just so sweet and fun-loving, and for God's sake, he looks just like Peter did when he was his age.
Well, he kissed me and I kind of let him.
I told him it could never happen again and that...
Oh, I-I thought that was kind of like, I'm open for business.
Look, I feel awful about it, but I told Larry that was it, and we couldn't be anything more than friends.
Yes, of course; he's a nice young man and he's practically family.
Yeah, I-I'm fine, I just hurt my neck this morning vigorously nodding approval to Judge Judy.
You know, maybe I should just go ahead and do your whole back.
Yeah, your bra strap is getting in the way here.
When's the last time you did anything nice for me?
And I wasn't about to stand by and watch him kick your ass.
No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts so he wouldn't kick them.
But if he's not your boyfriend, why'd you kiss him?
I guess Larry just reminded me of a younger version of you, and the truth is,
I liked that he was paying me a little attention, the way you used to.
Maybe I have been taking you for granted, but I promise I'll make it up to you.
For God's sakes, when push came to shove, you stood toe-to-toe with a much younger man and fought for me.
Oh, hey, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids, for stepping in to help.
I'm gonna do all the stuff for you that Larry was doing.
At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back. Afraid? I love doing that.
It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.
I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.
You never should've let any of your children contact you.
From now on, I'm making sure my sperm stays right where it belongs: in the bathroom sink.
Got into a little trouble and I'm gonna need a lawyer
Had a bit to drink and then I ran into a milk truck
Family Guy has been around since 1999 and whenever it's time for the Emmys, they don't give us one.
Yeah. Simpsons plays down to competition. Simpsons step into the sewer. Shame on you, Simpsons.
It's about time we made some quality television like Modern Family, Girls and Transparent.
Do you think he has sent us shoes made from banana leaves?
Boy, the, uh, the ethnic characters on these Emmy-winning shows aren't exactly rocket scientists, are they?
I've made plans to undergo surgery so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.
I think gender-reassignment surgery is very brave and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.
Brian's just mad because he has to be the lady one.
Which makes you the one who's gay in real life.
Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual Lily on Modern Family.
I'm now confident enough to share my truth with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son, Chris.
I'm here because I've decided to become the woman I am inside.
Can you find it in your heart to accept me?
Oh, Dad, science has moved so far past binary gender construction.
And if being a woman makes you happy, then in the words of Mr. Spock, It's only logical.
Wow, I couldn't follow any of that, but look how smart your audience is.
Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough that you were able to get me to do this.
Am-am I... is it... am I doing this to people?
Is it... do you guys feel like cutting off your penises?
No, but I can turn it inside out like rolling up a dress sock.
You've inspired me to nakedly eat this cake in a weird place.
Peter, I'd like to introduce the surgeon who will perform your procedure today.
Wow, I can't believe all you guys came out to support me.
You guys aren't just the best friends I've ever had.
So, the Emmy committee watched our submission for Best Comedy?
They hated it so much, they gave us a negative Emmy.
I mean, shows like Nurse Jackie are basically dramas, but they get comedy awards all the time.
That's how we'll win the Emmy with dark, confusing plot twists like on Homeland or Mad Men.
Robot Chicken is something kids used to watch in 2006.
It's basically four minutes of nonsense on at 1:00 in the morning breaking up personal injury ads.
Sure must be tough having a son with goofy noodle legs like mine.
Chris, I love you no matter how useless you are in a paddleboat.
We have to pay for Chris's doctor bills and meds for our daughter in the CIA.
How are we ever gonna pay all these bills that have been perfectly ripped across the top so the words past due are visible?
Oh, I just thank God there's no devastating turn of events going on that I don't know about.
I'm going to gradually talk quieter, as if I'm growing distant to show how overwhelmed you are by this news.
Mm. I wonder which of us is the bigger criminal.
No. I need money for sympathetic reasons and I have no other option than crime.
I mean, I could sell stuff on eBay, but... shipping.
Well, I am pulling a heist at a meth lab.
When it comes to selling drugs, you and me will be a better team than the old lady's eyeballs on Downton Abbey.
That way we can see all the awards flying at us.
You got to kill a kid at least once a season to make people go, Oh, I can't believe they killed a kid.
Damn it, Meg, we're about to take out the head of ISIS!
That was badass how it went from the guy burning up to the barbecue, right? Best Director.
Where'd you get the money for a briefcase like that, Peter?
I need the money to pay off my mysterious boss, Mr. Robot.
My whole plan, fallin' apart like a... House of Cards.
You know, growing up in Gaffney, my daddy always said, Turn the other cheek.
Kevin Spacey always said, I was just walkin' my dog in that park at 3:00 a.m.
I suppose it's time to tell my wife the truth.
'cause the doctor said I had the cancer... and I killed the guys, and Joe took all the mon... the money!
Because I'm darker than you and the audience ever thought!
If you think I'm going back to regular Hulu, you're crazy!
Now take off all your clothes so we don't get blood on 'em... when we kill that cop in the desert.
Like all television viewers, our first priority before deciding to continue watching a show should be whether or not it features enough diversity.
Would you mind reading it out loud for maximum old-timey effect? To P. Griffin, from the Emmy Board of Governors.
We understand you've been attempting to win an Emmy, stop.
No, there's another from Fleetwood Mac. Don't stop, stop. Thinking about tomorrow, stop.
And here's one from The Supremes. Stop, stop. In the name of love, stop.
Okay, so the deal is, I get girls like you jobs.
And then I send the demo tape to producers, and if they like you, they're gonna hire you.
All right, now, a lot of these scenes are gonna be you interacting with someone else, so I'll just come around and read with you.
And there you have it, Family Guy reaches a new low as it grovels and begs for a meaningless award.
I would say they've got about as much chance of winning an Emmy as the Republican Party has of accomplishing something.
Bill Maher? What are you doing not smirking outside a church?
Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons: first, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch, and second, to tell you that
To convey this moment of shock at the depth of the conspiracy around me, here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie Tough Guys Don't Dance.
It's like there's some kind of secret society that takes all the awards and is keepin' us from getting one.
You can't take a scene from Ferris Bueller, cross out the name Ferris, and replace it with Peter.
And the racial stuff on your show is just embarrassing.
Hell, I'm Shonda Rhimes, and I'm being voiced by a white actor.
And worst of all, you take this big pile of garbage, and you tie it all up by having everyone sit around saying, At least everything's back to normal, as if something happened.
Well, I'm glad all this Emmy nonsense is over and things are back to normal.
You know, I may not get Emmys, but I do get the best award of all... My family.
And this e-mail from a young fan. Dear sir, your show helped me when I was going through chemotherapy.
Aw. My favorite episode was when Homer stays home from church...
Ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy this spectacular, live-action chicken fight, starring Ty Burrell.
I've never been to a restaurant where they cook right in front of you.
Ugh. You know, later we're going to have to take one of those forced happiness family photos that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.
We haven't done anything as a family since we sat courtside at that NBA game.
Yeah, it's a whole different game when you sit down here.
That's usually what I need when I'm done in a bathroom.
Whoa, there's not even any swastikas carved into the toilet seat.
I haven't heard a guy's booming fart the whole time I've been in here.
I feel more relaxed than a chick on Facebook with her legs in front of a pool.
Nothing. After the other night, I made a decision: from now on, I'm only using women's restrooms.
I'll just ask them for something so ridiculous, they'll have to check in the back for it.
Yes, I'd like a $4,000 ping-pong table that's shaped like Easter Island.
How about a telephone that's made of vintage phone book paper and doesn't make or receive phone calls or work in any way?
There's nothing you can possibly imagine that's strange or useless enough that we don't have it here at Anthropologie.
No, it was just some low-class cockney woman from the mid-1800s and...
Hey, uh, don't tell Mom that we don't use car seats with me.
Okay, Stewie, you're gonna help Daddy by holding his iPad while he watches season one of House of Cards.
Well, no wonder... you're running all the apps at once.
I'll text back for you. Same thing, bitch. Just different shapes.
How many chicken fingers am I holding up, and do you want one?
And you're not in heaven 'cause you're not holding a margarita.
Ah, that's just a silly title they gave me down at the Karate Paintball Dirt Bike Club.
I haven't been this embarrassed since I was a rookie firefighter.
Hey, listen, I just wanted to say thanks again for patching me up.
I always had this crazy dream that one day I'd run into the guy with the other half.
Oh, that must be the name of the dead surfer I found this on.
They always use football announcers for events they know nothing about.
I'll take a dip if I know they're on vacation.
But you put that on to go to the Clam?
Like, he's one of those guys whose forearm hair makes his watch look even cooler.
I want him to think I was listening to a cool song.
Okay, just, uh, just give me a second so I can put away all my guitars.
I know. I haven't seen him this giddy since he discovered that single-loop roller coaster.
I bet it cost a ton to make this place look unfinished.
Hey, come over here. There's someone I want to introduce you to,
You may have heard, I'm also known for my practical jokes on the set.
One time, I nailed Nora Dunn in the head with an apple.
Did you also have a very public meltdown in another city?
Not one of them has ever vaped at a funeral.
We're gonna watch Cleveland put a garbage can full of coins in a Coinstar.
Like the guys in my photography club. Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones and Jared from Subway,
I love all the positive feedback, but maybe you guys send a pic?
One time, I jumped off a top bunk with a towel around my neck like a cape.
We were coming back from the Coinstar and saw your car out front.
I thought you were too busy to go out tonight.
It was one wand and I was using a gift certificate.
No, we actually met when I was administering first aid to him.
Hey, can I show you seven or eight things on my body and ask for medical diagnosises?
Stop it! Stop it. Guys, can I talk to you?
Look, this, this right here is exactly why I've been avoiding you.
Well, then why did those teenagers on the way in say, Cool wheelchair, dick?
Hey, look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed by us and you think we're losers, well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either.
Well, I hope you two are happy together, you jerk.
It's just a short hike from here to the summit.
Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something, I go all the way, like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.
I got punched in the throat at the Clam last night.
Maybe you jump off this cliff and I spin around over there and sing Sound of Music.
Or-or we could just go home and watch Sound of Music.
I can see you're a little nervous, Peter, but I'm telling you, it is easier than you think.
You know, just when I thought he couldn't get any cooler, he goes... (BLEEP)
And I just know I'm gonna be the one to have to identify the body.
Oh, these two poor souls are the best combination for a rainy Saturday.
Hey, Quagmire, how about one of your famous sexual stories?
We know the only reason you're here is 'cause your cool friend is gone.
You can't just treat us like garbage and then expect us to take you back like nothing happened.
Okay, that's-that's too bad 'cause that was kind of my plan.
Yeah, and this isn't even the first time you ditched us for someone else.
Remember when you blew us off to hang out with Jerry Seinfeld?
I know it's got to be hard to watch a man explode like a bug on a windshield.
I mean, I do see that every time I close my eyes...
They're really mad at me, and I'm-I'm afraid they don't want to be friends with me anymore.
You treated them like you don't even care about them.
It's just, when I hung around with Stryker, people thought I was cool, and it-it felt good.
Your friends thought you were cool, until you dumped them.
I just got to find a way to make it up to them.
Mom? Dad? Can Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones and Jared from Subway spend the night?
I don't know, Peter, but it's got to be something really meaningful, because imagine how they feel.
After all, you were willing to jump off a cliff for Stryker.
Well, they didn't say yes, but they didn't say no.
And now I know exactly what I have to do.
Lois told me to go jump off a cliff to prove my friendship to the guys.
I-I don't know, Brian. Her shirt was kind of open.
It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm about to thread the needle to prove to you guys how sorry I am and that I'd do anything to win you back.
And if something goes wrong and I don't survive, you can go ahead and delete the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.
I just wish the sponsor on my suit was a little cooler.
Peter, you don't have to jump off a cliff to prove you're sorry.
Not all of us believe that, but we took a vote and I agreed I'd respect the majority.
Look, you really treated us badly, but the fact that you'd be willing to literally risk your life just to show us how much you care, well, that says a lot.
If being cool means don't get to hang out with you guys, then I don't ever want to be cool.
What do you say? Can we just go back to being friends?
Who the hell is this Stryker guy you keep talking about?
He's the whole reason I went wingsuiting and hurt my head.
Yeah, your legs fell asleep and you bashed it against a sink.
Okay, well, right there you should've known it wasn't real.
I want you to know you are the best friends I've ever had.
Hey, this is a really weird question, but do you boys want to go out dancing?
We forgot all about my coma and my crazy dream about a cool guy.
We were just four middle-aged men doing Ecstasy at a Mexican prom.
Plus These Other 16 People with More Showing Up Every Day.
A show with just one character and an unlimited number of other characters?
Peter, you can't just sit there and watch TV all day.
I was gonna go down to the Guitar Center and annoy people.
FYI: My mom's not picking me up for a long time, because... she's dead!
Well, the buckets are full and the goats are happy.
We now return to Top Gun with only public domain music.
Oh, my God, what the hell did the goats do in here?
Peter, I both saw you and recognized my husband's voice.
Well, I guess we can all agree this was a great idea. The end.
Yeah, right. The drive here is like a counterclockwise trip around the Monopoly board.
So obviously he bought a herd of goats, and now they've taken over the house.
You know I would never put my children in harm's way.
Stewie was last seen with a goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel heading north on I-95.
Well, I guess it would be good to have some help with Meg and Chris.
Uh, it's a Tercel, but I don't think it's the right year.
Oh. Well, the only mouse in this neighborhood is our innocent neighbor, Frank Maxwell.
I'm just regular old Frank Maxwell, and I'm very late for work.
Under parody law, in order to use someone else's character in an unlicensed fashion, we have to provide something called commentary.
Now, let's see what else this new nanny has up her sleeve.
Okay, Stewie, this is favorite Belarusian children book called Goodnight Moon of Chernobyl. Goodnight Chernobyl moon.
Eh, it could be fun. And we haven't been on a date since I broke the Guinness record for longest nasal exhale at that Tina Fey movie.
How, uh... how's the stuff you do during your day?
Give me two of those round balls of butter and a breadstick.
Hmm. Well, maybe I can give you half a breadstick later.
As long as you don't mind a little marinara dipping sauce.
I told you we could have a fun time, just the two of us.
I filled it with water so we can do it hippo-style.
Weightlessly, with my feet lightly scraping the bottom as we do it.
And in the hippo tradition, first we must eat a whole head of lettuce.
So thanks to Natalia, we've been spending so much more time together.
Let me tell you, Joe, it's really been a rediscovery.
It is actually funny. At least three times an episode we turn to each other and we say, That's just like us!
Well, I was able to imagine myself there, which is why I chuckled.
Oh, and, waiter, have you seen this Fresh Off the Boat?
You know, Donna told me in the bathroom she and Cleveland haven't had sex in over three months.
I love that you share things that were told to you in confidence.
Joe's dead from the waist down, and Bonnie's dead from the waist up.
Natalia has helped put the spark back in our relationship.
I want to lean over this half-eaten blueberry pie and kiss you with black coffee breath.
Now, can I do you to a song you know, but sung in German?
Would you maybe make some coffee and give me a moment?
You come in late last night drunk and tell me to pack car for weekend getaway you book online.
Then you make me watch Diff'rent Strokes episode with substitute teacher played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Absolutely I do... I-I was just seeing if you do.
That-That's what any guy wants, the same gal again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, and again.
And every gal wants the same guy who keeps getting fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter...
You know what? I think this weekend will be fun.
Yeah. I mean, it's not like we're gonna miss anything around here.
Oh, you didn't hear? Today is the opening of the first-ever Spooner Street Farmers Market.
For 50 cents, you can get your picture taken wearing a farmer's hat.
'Cause I got to know if we should take 24 or 495.
Oh, look at this cute note. In lieu of television, please tune in to each other.
Ha-ha, indeed. And get this. Sorry no Wi-Fi, but the good news is your marriage has four bars.
Oh, here's another note. How adorable were those first two notes?
And the fireplace is decorative, so that's here to stay.
So, do you think word just got out in the daddy longlegs community, like, Hey, come to this hotel?
Do you want to turn on that overhead ceiling fan?
Can you notice anything in the world other than that?
Only that fist-sized moth in the lampshade by the bed.
I'm going to bed so that go home time comes faster.
Hey, will you let me know when you're done using the phone charger that I brought?
My husband, the Rockefeller, letting my parents pay for the nanny.
Kids still lining up around the block for those piano lessons?
I wonder which has more clutter on it, the piano or your treadmill.
Really? Let's go knock on the door of the next room and ask them which one of us is fat.
You're thinking of Mr. Hooper from Sesame Street, and I'd sooner bang him.
He was a business owner. He was a successful man.
You think you're the only one in this relationship who wants to be with a successful man?
Sorry, I was trying to scare that fly on your hand.
Oh, if you die, can I have all of your nothing?
I've been dead since the minute I said I do!
Well, what if I just said, The hell with it, go?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, arrow.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, I better get this dollar bill on its way.
You, sir, are a racist and a rude one at that.
Okay, yes, I am a mailman, but these are my 1983 Maurice Cheeks shorts.
Sorry, Cleveland, he wanted a surprise party and this is how he thinks it works.
You know, I bet you couldn't go a single day without booze.
Thank you, I will take that and give you a spoon 'cause you're a dumb baby.
Hey! What the hell do you think you're... ooh, a spoon!
Okay, another car ride, another opportunity to practice my DJ ramp-ups.
Just got to navigate iTunes while merging onto the freeway.
Peter The Riff Griff, shockin' ya and rockin' ya while I'm sittin' here talkin' to ya.
It's 75 and sunny, which means our Street Squad's gonna be out looking for them Super Stickers.
If you don't got one, get down to Linoleum Depot this Saturday from 9:00 to 2:00.
Now, I'm looking around and I'm seeing the Spin Doctors with not one, but Two Princes.
Hmm, what's the easiest thing to eat in the car?
Um, I'll have the huevos rancheros and an orange soda without a cap.
Well, there's this game where you try to toss a penny into a shot glass.
Yeah. I stole it from a dry cleaner who refused to put my picture up.
In recognition of that, I'd like to tip you one dollar.
You know, even though you and Peter have your differences,
Since you are my girlfriend and are hot, will you marry me so that I can bone you?
As long as you can always throw a Nerf football over my truck with your strong arm.
Maybe her knowing I have money will bring the moisture.
So, the guy asks, What's the name of the act?
I was wondering if you'd let me take you out for a feast of Indian food, followed by some blow-off-to-the-side curry burps?
All right, well, if you're ever free, here's me number.
Hey, I came by to bring you a frame for that birthday dollar I gave you.
Benjamin Franklin and Washington are both on the front, posing back-to-back like an '80s sitcom.
Okay, okay... a priest, a rabbi and a Frenchman walk into a bar...
All right, Chris, if we're going to find that misprint dollar, we have to retrace your steps.
Well, first I drank a Four Loko, and then I rode my bike down to the hair salon and shouted Nope! at all the women who came out.
Can I have a can of chaw and a fork?
Now to go ask Chris how they're doing this at the high school.
I know a guy who's got pills that help stop addictions.
Please put them back. But we'll take one of these.
All right, this is where we can buy those pills to get you off the sauce.
Heads up. Sometimes my knob plays peek-a-boo through my pee hatch.
I got to do laundry so I can stop hanging out in my underwear with a bunch of guys.
Seemed like the kind of guy who could help us out.
So I made it, Cleveland made it, and now you made it, Joe.
Hey, guys, I did it three more times while you were grab-assing.
You don't have ass or grass, so I'll be taking this dollar.
My heart broken, and nothing to console me but the screaming black dolphins.
I mean, I saw the movie, but I was like, Oh, (BLEEP).
I think it's like what a white dolphin calls a bay.
We buried her next to her mom six weeks later.
I gave me number to a girl and she threw it away.
Nobody's leaving until I sink a penny in that glass!
Say, Peter, you know, maybe you should try this one with your eyes closed.
But if I close my eyes, you'll all disappear and I'm a-scared of being alone.
Excuse me, sir, would you like to buy some candy to send Jewish kids to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?
Our date? But I thought you got rid of the dollar with my number on it.
Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass, so get your pants off and put a towel on the kitchen table!
Anyone who doesn't want to see my big, white, flailing butt, get the hell out.
Let's go to dinner. We can talk all about it.
I looked down on the ground and there was a dollar.
I don't know. Is my boat parked illegally in the harbor?
Are you gonna make a contribution to the Policeman's Ball?
I don't know. Are you gonna help me move next week?
Well, Stewie, you were right. I couldn't make it a day without drinking.
Well, the important thing is you barely tried and then got shot.
If you'll excuse me, I have to urinate every time something good happens.
Thank you. I couldn't help but notice you talked throughout it.
Hey, can I turn off everything but the black lights?
Yeah, the NBA All-Star Game was in town last week.
Hey, so, how much is this rare dollar worth, anyway?
Ah, well, some dildo wrote his phone number on it, so now it's worth jack!
Let's take all that we did today and make it all about Ellen.
You know, when it comes to making dreams come alive, there used to be nothing like the movies.
So we thought it would be fun to ask a few visionary Hollywood directors to create his...
Own unique version of the same Family Guy story, Peter Gets Fired.
Of the countless directors we contacted, three did not say no immediately, and I got a weird message from Paul Verhoeven that I could not understand.
In the black sedan, won't you hop inside my car?
Stop trying to be a clock, you ain't got the face for it.
Here's Christoph Waltz to fire you in a weird accent.
Well, you're not really ready, but if it's for revenge, you can stab me with this scalpel
Somebody order a wet-haired black guy to help with your revenge and sometimes
Peter, I'm standing here because I am the only Asian recurring character on the series.
Peter, you can tell I'm different because my weapon is different.
Oh, well, then, maybe I won't be able to chop your head off.
Welcome back to our special episode, featuring famous directors' versions of the same Family Guy story, Peter Gets Fired.
I'm still here in front of the Hollywood Sign, but I've asked the cameraman to adjust the shot so that you can only see wood.
Anyway, our next director is Wes Anderson, a guy who makes you feel like you ate a pot brownie and woke up in a greeting card.
On a March day, with a temperature of 64 degrees, my father lost his position with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company, near our village in central Quahogia.
With no discernible reaction, my father made his way home to deliver the news to my mother.
We lived in a New England cottage that was inside a vintage Army tent, that was inside a decommissioned submarine, that was all inside an old airplane hangar.
I've lost my position with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company.
My brother Chris had spent his life conjoining his twin loves, medicine and escape artistry.
Our dog Brian had been making a name for himself on the pickleball court.
Brian had quietly become the most successful grievance filer in league history.
I've summoned you all and arranged you in a perfectly symmetrical form in front of me to tell you some important news.
On an overcast Thursday afternoon, my father presented his play, one of the most compelling stories of the 1980s,
My father passed away in the spring of his 43rd year, and was put to rest in the family graveyard.
Wouldn't it be great if Wes Anderson's movies were actually that short?
Anyway, the Hollywood Sign is more historic than you think.
On this very spot, 52 years ago, a piece of beef jerky was planted in the ground and watered with Red Bull.
A speedboat erupted from the soil, and in that speedboat... was Michael Bay.
The Decepticons plan to destroy the Seven Wonders of the World, starting with the Hagia Sophia.
The what? Is that even one of the Seven Wonders?
If we could find someone strong enough to throw a keg with enough force, we might have a shot.
The only problem is, there's not a man alive who can throw a keg with that kind of force.
According to our sources, the search is underway for a man strong enough to throw a keg with enough force to save the Seven Wonders of the World.
There was a train and I like to count the cars.
Look, Peter, I didn't want to ask you to do this because of that maverick but awesome thing you did in the battle war of the past.
Is this the stuff you didn't want me to ask you about?
He went rogue and saved everyone's lives, but he didn't do it by the book.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go change my mind in the shower.
But I do things my way, and I pick my crew.
Deal. Now let me sit sideways on your motorcycle like a Vietnamese woman, and let's get out of here.
Still trying to put the world back together, I see.
Two months is a long time when you don't sleep and only eat ground beef.
This is my favorite out of all the Seven Wonders of the World.
Dad, nothing bad will ever happen to the Hagia Sophia, right?
When did our kids get so obsessed with the Seven Wonders?
According to the calculations on my Microsoft Surface, they have advanced cloaking technology.
We came from outer space to step on church stuff.
Let's have a fight with so many quick shots and close-ups, you can't tell what's going on.
I never got to repeat to him the line he said to me earlier in the film that has taken on new meaning in the context of all that has happened.
Today is the day we honor the late Peter Griffin, the hero who saved the Seven Wonders of the World.
You want to ask questions or you want to do it in a cemetery?
Yeah, no, I-I think I'm just tired from all the flying back and forth.
Maybe we just talk here for a little bit, and then you can tell everyone that I functioned as I should.
Thanks for driving me to the library for story time, Brian.
Today we're reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar vs. The Human Centipede.
That does sound fun, but what if I took you
But I like my library. I met Curious George there.
I'm just saying we should go to the library at Quahog University and take your education to a higher level.
I guess I can try it. I mean, I do want to get ahead.
I don't want to end up like Meg, doing sad one-woman shows.
Aw, you didn't come here for me; you came to be a creep.
I'm gonna go watch that young hotshot attorney over there who's clearly in the middle of a movie montage.
She said it best when she said... Bantam Press, 1851.
Wow, I've never seen someone go oh for six in 15 minutes before.
They probably forgot to study for an exam, so they organized a protest.
That is, when they're not looking down at their phones.
Someone wrote weird on the transgender bathroom, and the school president didn't overreact, so we want him fired!
I'm gonna yell Viva la Stool like a young, white drunkard.
And last week, a professor told his class to have a nice day, which is microaggression, because in our systemic rape culture no day is a nice day.
Well, I guess I could fire up my account again.
Oh, don't be that guy. Kelly Ripa no-shows at work.
Unless you're an athlete or a celebrity, no one cares.
Oh, yeah? Someone needs to tell Donald Trump it's not fashionable to wear orange on your face after Labor Day.
You can't stop me. Just like people can't stop Peter from ordering shepherd's pie.
Better get a tweet out before I go dark for a few hours.
Wow, I haven't seen that much camel toe since the Arab Spring.
Ah, look at that... Huffington Post just picked it up.
Hey, how was Baywatch? I want to see that bad.
Brian, it's not 2005... You can't just go online and say whatever you want.
Yeah, remember how mad people got when DiGiorno tweeted about domestic violence?
They'll see that I deleted it, and it'll all blow over. Trust me.
They're still pretty mad at me down at Dick's Sporting Goods.
Hmm. Those nighttime information technology classes must really be getting to Sid.
Gil, no! Uh, what about Barbara? Is she back there?
Not as long as you're living with that racist dog.
Hey, how come no one told me we were going to the Clam?
Peter, you better get out of here before I start saying sir like a cop.
Yeah, yesterday I went outside to try to get the mail and I had a seizure.
That may not be protester-related, but still, you got to do something, Brian.
Tell them that it was a mistake and how sorry you are and maybe they'll get off our backs.
I got to face them and hope they'll forgive me.
I'm a parrot who mimics words but doesn't comprehend them.
Humans, basketballs, talking parrots, and-and whatever else is out there... Whatever? It's whoever.
Anything that makes me uncomfortable in 2017 should be illegal.
I'm not a racist, all right? I just told a bad joke.
But nobody on the Internet ever takes the time to ask themselves, Is this worth freaking out over?
Or, Are there bigger problems in the world than this tweet?
I can't turn on my phone without strangers telling me to kill myself or that they're gonna kill my family.
Instead of killing myself, I should kill all of you!
You screamed black porn at the top of your lungs in front of women and children.
I am not the person those people out there say I am.
I know that, but you also haven't done much to prove that you aren't.
Oh! Brian, listen, we love you, but they're throwing things at our house.
Does this slow pan across our disapproving faces answer your question?
Yeah, I messed up, but what about all the stupid things Peter's done?
I'm sorry, Brian, but this is the way it has to be.
All right, radio, time for you to tell me what this all means.
Hey. Are you here for the Time magazines with some of the letters cut out?
Uh, no, I... no, I saw that you have an apartment for rent.
I just have one rule here: no kissing the mailman.
If I have other items I want to buy, uh, can I buy them here at the pharmacy window?
Sir, do you mind if I go ahead of you?
Hey, did you knock over a few bottles in aisle seven?
Why would I get rid of the big nail clipper?
Nice. Yeah, now I'm gonna tell you where it is.
If you ask me, Twitter is the perfect place for that guy, because he's a twit.
But an off-color tweet suddenly made Brian a pariah to all of Quahog, forcing the family to make the difficult choice of sending him to a crappy apartment on the other side of town.
You know, you're the only man in America who looks good in sandals and cargo shorts.
We haven't talked since I moved out, so I figured, you know, 10:00, you're probably on the couch watching Pawn Stars.
Is your family gonna give you money for the rent?
Well, lads, what do you think of the new album cover?
Great, but it won't look good when it's shrunk down for a CD.
Okay, but you all have to agree to do my song about the octopus.
And I'm gonna move to New York City and walk in and out of my building.
Okay, everybody, time to go to Grandma and Grandpa's house.
And, besides, today's Dolph Lundgren's birthday, and me and the guys always celebrate it by watching Rocky IV.
You always find a way to embarrass us at my parents'.
Hi. We're concerned that many of you Family Guy fans under 40 didn't get that reference, so I'm gonna take you through the actual commercial.
Okay, okay, watch. Here's where it all goes to hell.
See... All right, now, what I don't get is, if they know this guy, why are they surprised by the way he talks? Right?
And if they don't know him, why is he at the table?
Okay, now you have the information that would've made that funny had you had it going in.
Well, we got to watch the movie. It's our tradition.
Is that what that is? I thought it was a coaster.
I've been putting cold, wet things on it for a month.
Turn it on. I'm sure we can find Rocky IV on there.
I don't know how to turn it on. It doesn't have any buttons.
Hold on, hold on, let me try screaming at the PlayStation.
Eh, we were trying to watch Rocky IV and our DVD didn't work.
When I was a baby, they pulled me out of my moms real slow.
A Million Ways to Die in the West, no, thank you.
Well, there's a script you can go off of, if you want.
So, watch out, or you might end up in one of my scripts. Martha, gorgeous, headstrong, legs as long as spaghetti noodles, enters.
Hey, I'm a pathetic dog whose family kicked him out, and I want to kill myself.
Not only does he not get up, he's holding a sign that says, Workers of the world, unite!
Well, that-that seems like a logical idea, but this aggression will not stand!
Ho-ho! That's telling him. I hope this e-mail finds you well.
Oh, man, I wish I could see his face. I'll get right to the point.
My friends and I were aghast when we saw what you did to the end of Rocky IV.
Everyone knows that any American can beat up any Russian on any day of the week.
Chris continues to hit the books as best he can, and his grades have shown some improvement.
And Meg has become a woman in front of our very eyes.
I think we lost a little steam there at the end.
All right, Captain America, we have to get ready for the big fight with the other heroes.
Yeah, so I was thinking, maybe we could Netflix and grill.
The credit card numbers I've been guessing keep getting rejected.
Let's see what kind of Facebook account we got for this Martha.
You know, this is exactly what Dr. Fishbein was talking about.
I'll tell you something, if he were here right now,
You know, as someone who doesn't read the paper or listen to the news, you're not such a bad guy.
To show there are no hard feelings, anyone want to go to strip club and look at some cat emojis with me?
You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but it's such a nice day,
I was kind of thinking of taking my shirt off and riding a horse there.
Well, you're my friend now. Funny how this worked out.
Yeah. I mean, except for Ronan Farrow, who is clearly
I.. You know, I-I'm glad you could make it home for the family dinner, Ronan.
You got it, four eyes. Wouldn't miss a dinner with my cuckoo dad for the world.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, wheels up, let's go!
Oh, my God, she can smell the tiny bottles of booze.
Dear Lord, please send me a six-foot-seven blonde woman who likes to drink until she blacks out.
Man, Russia has the hottest and ugliest women in the world.
I've tried everything, Lou. I told her I was sorry.
Do what I do when people don't pay their rent: plant drugs and call the cops.
I don't know, I-I may be broke, but that seems like a crappy thing to do to somebody.
Walk me to my car. My trunk is full of coke.
I thought a lot about what happened, and I guess...
I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to tell anyone about what happened, and... maybe we could get that drink tomorrow.
Tell 'em you have no idea how your hair strands got in that baggie. Hello, Officer!
I knew you were a little twerp as soon as I met you.
Only thing I can possibly do is lick it repeatedly.
Now aren't you glad we did all that work earlier?
Today we decide which New England Patriot to suspend, eh?
You can't just do whatever you want in the world and get away with it.
Ladies and gentlemens, tonight we are here to see the fight to determine East/West superiority.
I can't believe it, but it sounds like the audience is starting to cheer for the American!
You've been hit several times in the head and sustained severe brain trauma.
Vlad and I finished our dance, then spent the rest of the night talking.
The next day, he poisoned me on the limo ride to the airport with radioactive tea.
I lost half my body weight, all my hair, and I have lesions that'll never heal.
Might go out to the trash, see if there's any possums to kiss.
And what do you care? Do you want the TV or something?
What? No, no. I want... I want to see you have fun.
Come on, you should go, you know? Let loose a little.
Can't be worse than waving at someone who doesn't wave back at you.
Lou, I like you a lot, but I-I think that's the last tape of you having sex with your girlfriend I want to see.
All right, I got to get over to my mom's wake.
No, I know, I just, I'm... saying it feels like everyone's getting cancer.
Oh, yeah? Well, here's what I think of your stupid work!
It's a hard lesson, but one he has to learn.
We just don't have anything in common with these guys.
Wow! Meg's so good at casually tossing bottles over her shoulder so they land upright!
And that's very popular right now, because we've run out of things on Earth.
You'd have to be dumb to try to rob that place.
What the... what the hell is going on over there?
That's what happens when you run with a screwy crowd.
I think I saw him getting rid of her body.
Hey, listen, you-you don't think... you don't think you could snag a couple of rolls of toilet paper, could you?
I'm here. I just wanted you to have to sit with those words for a minute.
Little of the old schnappster ought to get me right.
I got in trouble for saying something insensitive to trans kids.
Well, a few them started this a cappella group, and they're all kind of chubby.
So I said, You guys should call yourselves the Trans Fats.
Listen, what are we gonna do about this Principal Shepherd thing?
Look, all you know is that the guy was carrying a wet bag.
It's a news alert. Fiona Shepherd, wife of James Woods High School principal
You know, there are some bad people in this world.
All right, Stewie, what's the first rule of Fight Club?
Yeah. We were hanging out in the woods, and... this one girl pushed another girl over while she was peeing.
We don't know she's, like, for sure, definitely been drinking.
What, Mom? But I know what you're gonna say, and I know how you're gonna say it.
I don't want you drinkin' or your life's gonna go down the crappah.
I-I mean, I sound nothing like that, but it's a fun character. Heh.
I-I don't mean to laugh, okay? But that was funny.
I'm finally known as something other than the chubby girl who put the lunch lady in a headlock.
And besides, Dad's the one who pushed me into going to that party.
Listen, you need to talk to Meg about her drinking.
Because you're the one who told her to start going to these parties.
I guess it's just something I got to deal with.
So, you plan on going back at that banana, huh?
So the bastard killed his wife, and then reported her missing.
I have something better than proof, rank suspicion born out of boredom and loneliness.
Sorry, that's just not enough for us to go on.
You must be pretty tired from thinking about all this.
I've been using this eye cream, it's done wonders for me.
If you want to stop by. There's gonna be pizza and soft drinks, then a man's gonna talk about the whole line.
What if I go over there and try to find some evidence
I'll be more discreet than a guy standing by himself in the ocean.
Yeah, like, a little bit, but... but it's nothing you have to worry about.
I-I remember going to parties, walking up with a six pack.
You're so excited to get there, you start jogging a little.
Your friends are all there, and they're so happy to see you, they're practically cheering your name.
And then Mony Mony comes on at just the right time.
And everyone's dancing, and-and Laura Hallston's jugs are just slamming into you.
You don't have a care in the world, and if all of it came to an end right then and there, so be it.
Well, you're my daughter, and I don't want any of that for you.
Hey, you want to see where I was sitting when you were born?
Well, I can't talk to a drunk person if I'm sober.
But now I'm starting to sober up, so I'm gonna need one to keep an even playing field.
Now, if I give the word, you've got to get out of there, okay?
Stewie, he saw you! He saw you leaving his apartment!
I got a little bit of juice left, so we can either A, call someone, maybe they answer, maybe they can help, or B, we can definitely switch faces.
You think it's too early to tie our shirts around our heads to show we're going insane?
Do you feel like lying on the couch, rubbing your eyes, while listening to Lou Reed's Perfect Day?
Then I'll tell you what's wrong with you. You got a hangover.
Well, Meg, so I don't have to think about my throbbing headache,
I try to think of something else, like a riddle.
Uh, he's not memorable, but-but I know who he is.
Brian, a lot of people live in this building, and you can't tell it's a principal just from a walk.
Well... I'm, um... I'm actually doing a documentary about some of the finest principals in the country, and...
Well, to answer that, you'd have to go back a little while.
We found this in a Dumpster behind Principal Shepherd's building.
Look, I tried to tell you, I didn't kill my wife.
She just texted me today that she's moved out and she's banging my cousin,
And the food, well, I've been stealing it from the high school to make ends meet.
Have you ever heard of a company called Rodan and Fields?
Yup, that's the deal you make with the gods of fun.
Booze is nothing but trouble, and you don't need it.
Thanks, Dad, and if this is what drinking makes you feel like, you don't have to worry about it.
The actual Chris O'Donnell is not a Coast Guard helicopter pilot.
We don't get to do a lot of that kind of stuff together.
You saved the school $206 from all the food they recovered from Principal Shepherd's fridge.
And to answer it, we have to go back a ways.
Brian, I got to say, it's great to have you home again, buddy.
Living on my own was fun, but I couldn't stop thinking about all the stuff
And, Meg, I hope you learned your lesson about drinking.
Yeah, I think I'd rather live my life as a loser than feel bad once in a while.
Oh, what fun to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight.
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a Lincoln AKZ.
The Family Guy Christmas Special, brought to you by Lincoln.
You know, Chris, you and your stillborn twin Tmas were named after Christmas.
I see the kids put their gifts under the tree.
Well, as we know, the true spirit of the holiday is one of giving.
So, I've signed all of us up to volunteer tomorrow at a homeless shelter.
Last year, you wrote us a freaking poem, and now this?!
Nothing reminds you more of what you have than watching a grown man poo right through the split in his pants.
You know, it's just like, you know, music and fashion, all that...
Whatever I do, you know, I just want to be the best, because
Mark Zuckerberg promised he'd give me $50 million, fam, but then
The Family Guy Christmas Special, brought to you by anthropomorphic candy canes.
We now return to 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, as read by Norm Macdonald. 'Twas the night before Christmas...
What kind of rush are you in, man, you can't just say it was?
Oh, don't come at me with that it was stuff.
You know, two days ago, I was at the donut shop, and I said, Hey, donut guy, you got anything warm back there?
Hey, you know, uh, O. J. Simpsn is a wife-beating murderer, right?
Every year, we gather round and play O Holy Night from our favorite holiday album,
Well, I suppose I better get out of here before that overenthusiastic group of carolers makes their way in here.
How he came from heaven and was born in a manger bed
Using laser technology to shower your home in a blizzard of dazzling lights!
I can light up my whole house for just pennies a day.
Okay, first, I need you to take down last year's Christmas lights and put up this year's Christmas lights.
Then I need you to get the eggnog cups out of the attic and bump your head on a low eave.
After that, take my cousins to the airport and pick up my other cousins at a different, farther away airport.
Get the bags at Hobby Lobby and the pinecones at Pier 1.
Next, inflate the giant snowman and put it on our front lawn.
The pump's broken, so you'll have to do it by mouth.
Then it's just laundry, take out the trash, and move the house a little bit to the left.
What kind of presents would they possibly have for us?
Every year, my parents invite us to their house to enjoy Christmas in Newport.
And every year, we don't go because you don't want to.
Well, this year, I am going and the kids are coming with me.
I'll just watch my Patrick Swayze movie and take a too-full bath.
You think Santa could fit into a pair of 22-inch-waist jeans?
So, I've come back to help you recapture the true spirit of Christmas.
I just want to run through your hair like a dog bouncing in tall grass.
Peter, you've lost your Christmas spirit, so I'm taking you on a journey to Christmas Past to find it.
Th-This is my old house from when I was a little kid.
I've taken you all the way back to the year 1970/80/90.
I'll never forget that year, when President Richard Reagan Clinton lied to the American people.
And I made your favorite, peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.
Yeah, looks like your mom really went out of her way to make Christmas special for you.
You died before Game of Thrones, but a-a lot of people will like that.
And I just want you to see that not everyone in Quahog has lost the Christmas spirit.
Wow, no wonder I don't see Cleveland until New Year's.
Well, I know one family that isn't together for Christmas.
All right, everyone, grab your hot ciders and gather around the speakerphone.
It's been a long time since anybody's called me miss.
Oh, my God, she's doing that flirty laugh she does.
It's subtle, but when you've been married as long as we have, you notice these things.
Yeah, see, again, if you read between the lines, she's flirting.
You're not scaring me with any of this, Patrick Swayze!
And no matter what you show me, there's no way my family won't be right back here spending Christmas with me tomorrow!
Oops. That's what happens when I talk while I'm doing this.
I know. And it's so sad, he left his family with nothing.
Yeah, Lois had to sell her clothes to get by.
Boy, I love the holiday season with my husband who's right upstairs, just out of frame.
Oh, please tell me I lost the weight and kept it off this time.
Where I will attempt to smuggle drugs back into the country in my rectum.
Aw, I knew there was some kind of rug-pull coming.
The lock maker, where I have a minimum wage job.
I'm going to Brown... four boxes of Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage for my breakfast.
Well, I'm proud all my kids got into Ivy League puns, but what happened to Brian?
Look, I haven't watered my Christmas tree for a few weeks now, so could you watch your really long cigarette, please?
Did I tell you I went to the mall with my daughter and an employee thought we were sisters?
They went to Newport because you wanted to be by yourself.
Because that's what happens when you lose your Christmas spirit.
Yes, it was an obscure chapter written during Dickens' opium and spoiled lamb phase.
All the porn girls I follow on Instagram have Santa hats on.
Yeah, it is, except every time Grandpa bends over to get a present, his robe opens up.
Yes, Lois, I'm here, all loaded up with Christmas spirit and a sack full of hastily bought gifts from the CVS.
For Chris, a special People magazine look-back at Robin Williams, 'cause he killed himself.
For Brian, a Rhode Island sweatshirt with both Rhode and Island misspelled!
And for my beloved wife, a lawn chair that was 80% off because it's winter.
Oh, Peter, I can't wait to drink outside in this.
And finally, for Meg, a clock radio with an iPod jack for the iPods they don't make anymore.
And, Patrick Swayze, thanks for helping me find the true spirit of Christmas.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
Well, actually, there's one thing in heaven that Chris Farley won't do with me.
Peter, come on, time to get dressed for our Valentine's Day dinner.
Not like last year when we went to the Outback Steakhouse, but it's out as in the gay way.
We'll get to the specials, but first, I need to tell you...
We have to focus all our attention on our hostess now.
Well, I better set out a can of tuna fish and a cigar for Arthur Valentine.
Uh, you want to tell us what the holy hell that was?
I'm afraid it's something we made up that we finally need to deal with.
Peter, poor Chris didn't get a single valentine today from any of his classmates.
Some of the kids think he's weird because he takes his shirt off to pee.
And he comes every Valentine's Day on-on a-a... a purple Vespa to, um... to bring candy and sweet notes to children who've managed to not use any swears in the last year.
B-But not for medical reasons, he just likes the look.
Plus, he-he wears a Cat in the Hat hat and sometimes a scarf, no matter what Lois says because it gives him a youthful vibe and adds some color to his face.
I assumed he'd outgrow it in a few years, but, Peter, it's time we have a talk with Chris.
We've got to put an end to this Arthur Valentine nonsense.
Donna and I are spending our Valentine's Day in Johnnie Cochran pajamas, just caressing each other in a very beige bedroom.
Yeah, and hopefully Bonnie and I'll do a sexy bath night like last year.
She laid out a trail of rose petals, and I elbow-crawled to the sponge and shower chair.
I go down to the video store and put my hand on Love Actually at the same time as a woman, and I go, Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
What about you, Brian? What are your plans for Valentine's Day?
Ha! Looks like Brian's the only guy with nothing going on.
I do, but she needs help lifting me into the shower chair.
Our top story, today the Quahog River was dyed red in honor of Valentine's Day.
So if you're looking to do a river murder, this could be your window.
I hope Rupert and I haven't been too loud up there.
Well, Brian, if you're stuck being a single loser, you might as well just embrace it.
I-It's actually time your father and I had a talk with you about Arthur Valentine.
We're sorry, but you're old enough now to know the truth.
You know, if Chris is this hard to convince, we may just have to kill Arthur Valentine.
Maybe we make Chris believe that Arthur Valentine is dead.
I had him pump my stomach, too. Doc, what was in there?
An old pet rock, an antique clock, a ton of red Play-Doh
They were in my tummy 'cause they all looked yummy
He tried to eat 'em, so you shouldn't feed him.
Hey, does anyone call you Bill Joel or William Joel?
No, they don't, because I'm an adult, which is kind of what I was getting at.
And did you see the lady outside with the empty cat carrier?
Yeah. Yeah, I bet she actually thinks that thing loved her.
Uh, I got this small cut, and they wanted to bandage it so I'd stop chewing the crap out of my foot.
Aw, that sucks. I love chewing the crap out of my foot.
But while I was here, I also had to get... a prescription filled.
Let me give you my number. It's on the back of here.
I think you want the Veteran Aryan's Center next door.
Ah, I see the confusion. This must happen all the time.
You think you could be with me? Right here? In this place?
I met someone amazing the other day at the vet's office, and...
And it's so great dating someone who understands why it's especially important to walk around in a circle many, many times before lying down.
Sort of. I-I was just rereading some of the texts
Chris, come down here, quick! I see Arthur Valentine outside!
I love you so much, and I haven't cussed once today!
Dad, get the bowl of tuna from under my bed!
You know, I-I know they're not supposed to be that bright, but that was, that was pretty genius, you know?
I mean, leave it, leave it to a Polack to just grab the paint with his hands and just start chucking it everywhere.
But, Brian, you don't have to keep trying so hard to impress me.
Truth is, I haven't felt this way with anyone in a long time.
Listen, I'm really sorry to cut things short, but I've got to go; I have rehearsal.
It's kind of dumb, but it's for a dog show.
I mean, I... God, I-I bet every time you go snaffling on it, you have to stop and admire it.
Nancy, will you make me the happiest man in the world by turning a blind eye to the AIDS crisis and ineffectually trying to warn young people about drugs?
The shock of seeing Arthur Valentine die seems to have really gotten to him.
Robin Williams tossed a baseball to Robert De Niro, and he snapped out of it and caught it.
I think we went too far by killing Arthur Valentine.
It's the only thing that'll snap him out of it.
Well, maybe, but what if I try it with a basketball?
He didn't even flinch. It's bad. Let's do your thing.
Let's-let's twirl some toilet paper up into his nose, and-and then when... we'll-we'll do your thing.
I smell the poop on your breath, and then that's all I want, but my owners made an arrangement with the organizers of the next dog show.
They paid a lot of money to schedule me to breed with whichever male dog wins the competition.
I know it might seem odd to you, but this happens in the dog show world.
I have to have sex with whichever male dog wins, whoever that ends up being.
All right Brian, now if we're going to get you ready to compete in that dog show, we've got a lot of training to cover.
You click it when you want me to do a trick, and then I get a treat, so I associate the two.
Now, Brian you've got to roll over and be good on all fours.
But maybe we should just focus on getting ready for the show.
Wait, shouldn't I be the one who clicks if I like the joke?
If it's funny, I can. And so far, they've all landed.
You know, I was supposed to be on one of those planes.
Uh, you know, I... You-you just made dog shows sound so fun the other day, I-I thought I'd give it a try.
Brian, most of these dogs have been training since birth.
Listen, I've never told anyone this, but I killed a jaywalker in 2002.
It's why I always talk and ask questions so much.
When there's any moment of quiet, I think about her.
It's Arthur Valentine, here to accelerate awkwardly into a bush.
I have to destroy your brain and then talk about it for the next hour!
Valentine's Day would take on new meaning for Chris in the years to come, but he would remember none so bittersweetly as this one.
Because this thing is gonna come down to the arbitrary whims of whatever elderly volunteers were able to get transportation here on a Tuesday.
He's a four-time winner and kind of a crowd favorite.
Yes, you all want to start the dog show, don't you?
And as our judges tabulate the results, we can now announce our female division.
The winning bitch, for the tenth year in a row, is Katherine Heigl!
No, but for real, it's that dog Ellie over there.
In fact, could someone maybe turn on some-some Drake or The Weekend?
Oh, I have an all-access pass to anything in this town that's sex-related.
If-if you just-just give me a second to get, like, a scenario in my head.
Uh, maybe a hot babysitter who needs to pay for college so she, uh...
I'm sorry, Brian, but this is what I was trying to tell you.
I'm sorry, too, but I see now that you were right.
I'm just not sure how this could work or-or how our relationship could fit into your world.
I promise to name one of the puppies after you.
Let's just cross our fingers... it's not one of the ones he eats.
Okay, we're at the part where he bites down on the back of my neck, so we should probably wrap this up.
If-if it hadn't been for all that, I... trust me, I-I would've, I would've set her world on fire.
Oh, hey, right, 'cause of that thing we started doing.
I felt dirty for an hour, but it's gone now.
I wish you hadn't said that at full volume in front of our children.
I can't tell if they have a really good marriage or a really bad one.
All right, time for Fast and the Furious one through seven.
This is a 14-hour meditation on the importance of family, fast cars, product placement, racial ambiguity and family.
Someone said they were going to get me eight on Blu-ray for my birthday, and someone got me a limited edition
Um, yeah. We're going in order from best to worst.
By the way, don't tell Rupert about Paul Walker being D-E-A-D.
Ludacris looks like a human peanut, and Tyrese looks slick.
Like Africa and Asia had sex while Europe sat on a chair in the corner of the hotel room and watched.
Are you gonna keep talking like this during the whole thing?
We just missed the scene where half the team steals a tank while the other half pretends to be a DJ for some reason.
A loaf of bread, a container of milk and a stick of butter.
A loaf of milk, a container of bread and a Joe Dirt DVD.
A Joe Dirt DVD, Scarlett Johansson and treasure from a fish tank.
Beloved cereal icon Boo Berry is now greeting customers in aisle six.
You're not the one threatening me on Facebook, are you?
Hey, you know what I always loved about your cereal?
Did you guys know you were doing that? Oh, my God.
This is the best thing to happen to me since I became a wisecracking, fourth-wall-breaking superhero.
The treatment didn't give me powers, but it did spread cancer to my anus.
Oh, I like that we're comfortable doing things separately, too.
Do me a favor and don't wake me when you come up, though.
Yes, you do. You always step on the creaky board.
Why don't you grab yourself a Corona, hit play and enjoy the ride.
So? If you were driving drunk and ran him over, would you still go to jail?
He always knew there was something off about you, and now we know what it was. You're a psycho!
Why are you brushing your teeth with your left hand?
Boo Berry touched it, and it is now a sacred space, like a temple.
Okay. Well, I'm gonna have middle-aged woman, boobs-falling-off-to-the-side sleep now.
I'm looking for Stewie. He and I had a fight, and I'm scared he might've done something drastic.
Okay, I see he got to you before I did.
Yeah, well, he cremated that stuffed animal, and he's going to Vermont to scatter the ashes.
Hmm. Well, violent murderers can often be found at bus stations, so why am I surprised?
He and I had an agreement, if he died first, I would scatter his ashes on a mountain.
If I died first, he would throw my body whole into the fountain at the Bellagio.
Oh, come on. If I don't, I'll get stuck next to that guy with the heavy hands.
I swear to God, do not take one step further, or I will hit you.
Look, why are you being such a jerk over a stupid bear?
He wouldn't care! He didn't hear them! He's a doll!
I was sick of you talking to him all the time.
I was sick of you complaining to him about me when I'm right there in the room.
And I was sick of always playing second fiddle to that bear!
This isn't going to make me forgive you, you know.
You know, maybe it's appropriate that you're my ride up.
Want to know some of the other things he called you?
Clifford the Big Red Sphincter That We See All the Time
I swore I'd never wash it again, even though Lois keeps telling me to.
Yeah. I'll text Lois, see if we can't all come up with something.
Just reply to that last GIF she sent of the sloth putting on the headphones.
Is it weird that we're in a group text with our friend's wife but not our friend?
You know, once we're done here, I'm never speaking to you again.
Well, how the hell was I supposed to know it was gonna upset you so much?
You saw me spend almost every single minute of every single day with Rupert since I was born!
Ha-ha-ha! When are they gonna put in the elevator, right?
He was the most important thing in my life, and you willfully violated the sanctity and trust of our friendship when you destroyed him!
Why is Rupert the one baby thing you're hanging onto?
Why are you so upset over a doll when I'm real and I'm still here?
And one day, all too soon, I'm gonna be crying at your funeral in an Armani suit, and people are gonna be like, Oh, nice suit, and I'm gonna be like, Why are you talking about my awesome $2,000 suit... my friend's dead!
Feels like that story is less about me and more about your suit.
Rupert was real, why are you so jealous of him?
Hey. Heh. When are they gonna put in the elevator, right? Heh.
For the record, I would have preferred to dress as Frankenburry.
So should... should we just... sprinkle him around randomly, or...?
Oh, don't be a savage, Brian. What is your problem?
I never wanted this to happen, and it happened far, far too soon.
But most importantly of all, he was a great friend.
Stewie... and I are both... incredibly grateful for all the time we had with you, and we wouldn't change a single moment.
I have a Gatorade bottle full of pee from the bus.
I don't know why his parents are still bringing him to school.
I've never seen him when he's not just thrown up.
It reminds me of the therapist's office Bethenny Frankel goes to on The Real Housewives of New York City.
She looks like a wooden doll you'd find in an Eastern European toy shop.
Oh, don't act like you don't know who she is.
We all know who Bethenny Frankel is, whether we like it or not.
I don't mean to name-drop, but I kind of know Andy Cohen.
He originally wanted me for The Rachel Zoe Project, but I said no, so they went with Brad.
And now look... that could've been me on Fashion Police with Melissa Rivers 14 times a year.
Mm, I hope he didn't get cancer all over this seat.
If they don't give us a day off when he dies,
It's-it's like you've already given up before the day's even started.
You might as well tattoo Can't afford Starbucks on your forehead.
I haven't heard of any of the schools you went to, but I'm sure they were great.
I do. Mostly because I come across a lot of dicks.
Well, I've often been told that I have a British accent.
You mean to tell me you don't hear me speaking
But you're the absolute only person who hasn't noticed it.
Well, just the people who can understand me, which you appear to be one of.
It sounds like it's very important what other people think of you.
So after five minutes, you think you know me, is that it?
I am trained, Stewie, to observe things that give me an insight.
And, yes, I do feel I know you a bit.
You do feel you know me a bit. Mm-hmm. Okay.
I see you're on vacation in Rio de Janeiro in this photo with your partner, I'm guessing.
At a quick glance, I'd say there's roughly a 26-year age difference between the two of you.
Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows while still giving you a younger mind to shape. Oh, you mean you haven't seen All About Eve,
And a younger body to make you feel more virile.
Taking into consideration the math, he was probably born at a time when the most popular name was...
I imagine you wooed Michael with a sonnet or monologue each day.
And no one had ever done anything so romantic as reciting Shakespeare for Michael before.
While not as physically attracted to you as you are to him, that's okay...
I see a prescription for heart medication on that table.
You don't want to worry Michael, you say to yourself, even though the truth is it embarrasses you.
And no need to have reminders at home of what's just around the corner, is there?
And your office is your haven, since Michael doesn't work and is often at home, perhaps as a result of a low-level depression that you don't really want to get into with him.
Oh, he always planned to have a career, but he could never settle on exactly what it was he wanted to do.
And at first you liked having him at home to take care of the house and plan trips.
So that's just what happened. And that's a job, too, he reminds you over the years.
Michael likes to travel, and he prefers the finer things.
And you'd like to give them to him, wouldn't you?
But it's a bit difficult on a child psychologist's salary at a Rhode Island preschool, I'd imagine.
Fortunately, you don't have children, so you do have some disposable income.
Oh, you have talked about it with other couples, just for show, probably at dinner with younger friends of Michael's who are starting a family, you know, to be part of the conversation, to feel included.
But you said you preferred your trips and your rescue dog named after a character most likely from Dickens.
Ah, how accomplished and affluent you both look in this photo.
Now, I see you're both wearing Ralph Lauren Purple Label dress shirts that retail starting at $495.
But from the disfigured button holes on one and the small discoloration on the other,
I can see you bought them at the outlet in Providence.
Probably third markdown, in which case, $49, give or take.
I can see that you went there during summer vacation, which is, in fact, winter in Rio, outside of the high tourist season.
And I see that you're on the rooftop pool deck at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema, the most exclusive hotel in all of Brazil.
Had a friend that went with his older boyfriend, who makes a lot of money in, most likely, banking, much to your chagrin.
You tell him people are starving in the streets in Brazil.
The window that Michael is always desperately peering through and sadly on the other side of.
You don't go on Airbnb, because you don't trust it, even though Michael has stories of friends who have found the most fabulous places.
But when you take him to the place you're actually staying, the one you found on TripAdvisor that was rated number 27 of all the hotels in Rio and was having a special rate of 295 U.S. dollars a night...
Which is still not cheap, you remind him, most people never get to visit half the places he's seen, you tell him... you can't help but feel like a bit of a failure as you see the look of disappointment on his face as he enters the room.
So you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks, once you've seen the restaurant prices online.
And once there, you can see how Michael begins looking at all the older men who can afford to take their boyfriends... I'm sorry, husbands...
And you worry a little, that you're diminishing in his eyes with each passing year.
But you tell yourself you're being ridiculous, as you see Michael glancing about the rooftop deck, looking at all the young men, men that would be 20 years younger than even Michael, men that you're invisible to.
But he isn't yet, not completely, and you're jealous and you loathe yourself for it.
But Michael wants a photo, and he says, Let's take a selfie.
But you say, Let's ask someone to take one of us and make some tired joke about selfies that only you laugh at, wishing that you could take it out of the air as soon as you've said it, as it's just one more indicator that you're older than everybody here.
So Michael calls over a young man wearing a tiny swimsuit to take the photo and makes a crude joke that embarrasses you.
But the young man laughs, and he and Michael share a moment that you're not part of.
Which explains Michael's joyful grin and your slightly disconnected half-smile.
And you've posted the photo on Facebook, and Michael's posted it to his 86 followers on Instagram...
To at least give the impression, in your Ralph Lauren shirts, holding your $20 cocktails, that you're both way more successful than you are.
But it makes you feel a little dirty, the lengths you have to go to in order to keep Michael happy.
And every time you glance at this picture, you wonder, How long before he leaves me?
See? I guess we both know each other a bit.
It seems like you're keeping a lot bottled up inside.
I try to fit in with the other boys and talk about things like dirt and shapes, but they won't play with me.
And I-I don't have any friends, and I have nobody to eat lunch with.
It's very interesting you'd say that you have no friends,
Yes, of course I have. But according to Tyler, it was no accident.
Apologies. Those of us with British accents pronounce it con-trah-versy.
I only pushed Tyler down the stairs because I like him and I'm afraid he won't like me back.
This whole thing isn't because I'm gay, so-so calm down.
If anything, I'm less gay than I used to be.
But do I think that Grant Gustin and I would make the most adorable Instagram couple?
Grant Gustin plays the Flash on the CW, if you were wondering.
Because, you know, most people over 70 probably don't know who he is.
Anyway, fluid is something I hear being tossed around a lot now.
It must be difficult for you, Stewie, being so intelligent.
You know, sometimes I don't know where I fit in.
I just... I just want to be like everybody else, but nobody's interested in the things that I'm interested in.
And I'm so anxious all the time, but I... I always put on a brave face and try to hide it, and I... I give myself these excruciating migraines.
I actually have way more hair than this, but I pull it out.
I j... it's just I think about her a lot.
Some people don't think I talk about it enough anymore, but mind your own beeswax is what I say to them.
It's hard to find someone who can converse on one of those topics, let alone both.
And I really, really, really want to see Hamilton, but by the time it gets here, I'll be 30.
I think I'm still the only one in town who's even heard of it, and it's been out for over two years.
And I've even memorized some of the songs, but I have no one to sing it for, and I'm really good.
I really... I really need you to hear me sing Hamilton.
I want the world to fall in love with me eight times a week.
If it's not good this time, just remember it was good at home.
By 14, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
Dripping down the drain, put a pencil to his temple
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
But it felt good. Like-like, I got so much out, you know?
My mother boils water in an old Jiffy Pop tin.
If you liked Tyler and you wanted to be friends with him, then why did you push him down the stairs?
Can I tell you a story about another little boy?
When I was your age, I grew up in London
And in the chaos, I searched desperately for my parents.
You see, I was the sole survivor of my family.
So I was sent to live with an aunt in Cornwall.
But she had too many mouths of her own to feed, so...
I was next sent to a distant cousin in Northumberland.
But she didn't care for children, and off again I went, this time to an orphanage in Gloucestershire.
But they didn't like little boys from London in Gloucestershire.
So I pretended I was from Shropshire, of all places.
I'm only here for 40 minutes, and this is already a really long story with a lot of locations.
And I don't feel like waiting to see how it links up to my thing.
I know what it's like to feel alone and to have to pretend that you're something you're not.
Oh, and also, how my first kiss was with a Nazi.
See? We didn't need to go back 1,000 years for that.
I suppose the question is why you feel the need to do that.
And these are my only pants. How sad is that?
When I was in the orphanage, my Sunday shoes were potatoes.
I realized that when you picked up that photo and decimated my entire life.
Everything about me is this carefully-constructed persona designed to keep people at arm's length.
The accent is-is nothing more than an affectation, a-a coat of armor to get me through the day, just an image I cultivated so I could feel special.
For once, to talk with my real voice without the... the burden of trying to sound like someone I'm not.
I'm sorry. That just all sounds like the same person.
Well, Stewie, that was quite a breakthrough we just had.
You're the only one who's ever met the real me.
Well, I'm honored, and now, the rest of the world is going to meet him.
Like any other zero in this miserable town, like my family.
I won't do it! I don't want to be like any other person!
Except... there's one person that does know the real me, and that's you.
I'd like to, really I would, and you were super helpful, and this... this kind of seems like a crummy way to repay you, but... I'm not going to get it.
It's because I can't have anyone know the real me.
Not to sound ghoulish, but any indication how much longer you're going to linger?
Yeah, because you're still pretty chatty, is... is why I'm wondering.
Mm, yeah, not worried. For me, this is kind of no bigs.
It was like an orchestra of squeaky chair springs and groaning floorboards playing her out.
Sowwy. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace. And lips, O, you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss, a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
But I wouldn't expect you to know, since you're not in any way...
Yes, just look at our great city, bustling with activity.
I do, but our friend Bartholomew went in lots of chimneys in the '80s, and now he's sick.
I thought you might be upset because we won't be able to solve mysteries...
Crown Jewels stolen! Another one bites the dust, says Queen.
And coming up, Russia and Prussia still named basically the same thing.
Ghastly. Who would have the audacity to steal the crown off the queen's head?
I've had him on the run for a year now.
His criminal empire is in shambles, but he won't go quietly.
When I see a man about to go on a sea voyage and not wearing a topcoat, with no watch fob, and whose spats are not fully buttoned...
I extrapolated the path of the bullet, and triangulated the deflection point...
For the court's amusement, we now present Sir William of Cosby.
Well, you see, the children of today are wearing their pantaloons so low, gazoozle, you can see the first three layers of their undergarments, zazzle, zoozle.
I get away with this for another 122 years, you see.
Mum, may I say, it's been a pleasure serving you, but I've decided to retire.
It would be a wonderful cap on my career to have a knighthood.
Sometimes the bigger ladies take a little longer, you see.
But with Moriarty gone, and with you, my biographer, leaving me for marriage, there is little point.
And you, old chap, are about to solve the biggest mystery facing men of our time: the wedding night.
Lifting her nightgown, nightshirt, evening cape, boudoir coverall, torso doily, and the various corsets and trusses below.
Exposing her shame to God, followed by brief missionary coitus with no eye contact.
And then, five months later, a stillborn child the size of a digestive biscuit.
Boiled beef for every guest, fish head stew, old cheese, and men's attire will be provided by Gentlemen's Wearhouse.
You're gonna fancy the way you look, this I vouchsafe.
It's an urgent missive from Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
Oh, darn, there's been a murder and he's begging for my help.
Now I've got to see if I can dig that hat out of the trash.
It appears she was killed by our old nemesis, the Scottish Brute.
All his victims were prostitutes whose names began with the letter V.
This one's name is Veronica, as evidenced by this satin softball jacket that bears her name.
But most significantly, the Scottish Brute replaced his victims' intestines with bagpipes.
There are only two possible explanations: either there's a murderer who has copied the Scottish Brute's methods, or I put the wrong man away.
That's right. You ever seen a man with two right hand...
Oh, you've done more than made up for it, Mr. Holmes.
All right, well, I hope you make a go of it.
These red locks of hair I found at the crime scene?
I prefer a man with a future and a woman with a past.
All right, let's get out of here before we're all arrested for the crime of bum-fancy.
And now I will disguise myself as a prostitute named Valerie.
Yes. Now, I'll stroll around the block, and you'll proposition me, loud enough so the killer can hear.
And I'm afraid you'll have to catch her without me.
Maybe you should put that off for a little while.
Oh, I've done enough of that, my friend, especially after that raucous bachelor party trip you threw for me in Las Vegas.
Watson, I don't know how to tell you this... but the murderer we've been looking for... it's your fiancée, Constance.
Well, let's go to her place and I'll show you.
Just go easy, it really hurt on the way in.
I'm sorry, Watson. Unfortunately, it appears my deductions were correct.
See, Holmes? It says here... these are test results. She has gonorrhea.
If she's a murderer from this time period, that means there will be a terrible, pretentious musical about her one day.
We'll be right back after these turn of the century messages.
Room Temperature Gin: drink it without women, have an eel pie, then go to bed.
Let's get separate rooms just so we can spread our stuff out.
Excuse me, sir, what's the next stop for this train?
Ugh, I hate when they let the infirm ride on the train.
Sir, you owe an apology to me and all the good people of (BABBLING).
It's nice of the locals to act as their own train crossings.
I hope no one from the train is on this boat.
Yes, but how do we find Constance in one of the biggest cities...
Quick, after her. We have to chase her through a series of shots where she has an inconsistent lead on us.
I think we may have just photobombed that family's picture.
He said you'd never figure it out, and that he'd be victorious.
I still don't understand what she meant by he said you'd never figure it out, and... That he'd be victorious.
I'll be replacing your innards with these bagpipes, Queen Victoria.
And I was able to fool you, as I am a master of disguise.
Seems like you're just good at dressing up like a woman.
That was the vital clue that these murders were for my benefit.
I was dismantling your criminal empire, and you wanted revenge.
So, you concocted an elaborate series of murders with clues leading me to the fictional Scottish Brute.
Meanwhile, two toothless, British homeless people had filthy sex in an alleyway.
They would become the grandparents of the guys from Oasis.
She arranges for me to kill your imposter... and commits an identical murder so I would come to the inescapable conclusion that I put the wrong man away.
Constance would lead us away from England while you killed the last prostitute with the name V.
And I'd get the blame for freeing the man who killed our beloved queen.
She formed an alliance with the Dutch royals for shared control of Guyana.
Holmes, with this case, you saved the entire British Empire.
From South Africa to the Suez Canal, from Cyprus to Australia, all of Canada and Grenada, even Antigua and Jamaica.
Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Uganda, and the United Arab Emirates.
I don't know. I-I think I turned into America Ferrera.
Just doing our part to give back to the community.
Could you just ball them up and throw them out the window?
Thank you for protecting us and for posting revenge porn on Marine Corps message boards.
I don't have time to hear the rest of your sentence, but thank you for being a veteran because you're definitely a veteran.
On behalf of all TV football dummies, thank you for your service.
Wow. Feels real good to be a veteran, even better than buying a bottle of Newman's Own.
Hey, someone just bought a bottle of bland salad dressing.
Now we can use all proceeds to do jihad stuff.
Hey, so when really fat people come, make sure we're opening both doors.
Do I need to remind you I actually am a veteran?
And I'm sickened by the thought of trolling for free handouts on account of being a vet, much less pretending to be one.
Quagmire, what if I told you your glasses do Playing With The Boys?
There we go. Hey, another round for me and my veteran buddies.
I'm Kenny Loggins and you're a groupie I brought here for sex.
Well, as a veteran, I get to star in a viral YouTube video of me reuniting with my beloved pet.
This is my heterosexual roommate, Ace, with whom I shared the lion two decades ago.
You know, guys, if being a veteran is about anything, it's about getting half-hearted applause on a Southwest Airlines flight.
Holy crap, you're Eric Dane from Marley and Me, and other stuff!
I'm afraid you got to give us your front-of-the-plane seats
Thank you so much. This is why I served. USS Nathan James?
The Nathan James is the fictitious ship on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Adam Baldwin and Jocko Sims.
I fly Southwest to have a classy experience and you've ruined it.
You three are in violation of the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to pretend to be a veteran.
Oh, so suddenly it's a crime to break the law?
Mr. Quagmire, you're free to go, but the rest of you will have to come with me.
I thought we had it bad, being gay overhead bins.
Real servicemen and women have made real sacrifices for this country.
And you. You're an actual veteran; you should know better.
Now, everywhere I go, it's like people are staring at me and whispering.
You men are accused of violating the Stolen Valor Act, and that's years of jail time.
I'll waive the charges, but only on the condition that you men enlist in the military for real.
Glenn, if you were half the man I used to be, you'd stand up and join them.
The four of us will join the Coast Guard together.
Okay, come on, let's get out of here. Let's go. Let's go.
Now, come on. Who here can pantomime driving a boat?
Now can you bounce with the waves a little bit?
Shh, Quagmire, I got to focus on my boat here.
The way people's talking makes me think we're gonna be dealing with a lot of water.
You guys seem to have what it takes, so raise your right hand as I recite the Coast Guard pledge. When you're here, you're family.
Oh, crap. Where in Iraq is Fort El Ahoud Urd Ali?
No, it's not sweet. It's a joke. This whole thing is a joke!
Compared to the Navy, the Coast Guard is totally unprofessional and incompetent, like that ancient Roman intern.
Wait, Dad, before you go, can you teach me to shave?
Well, for starters, bud, that's supposed to be on your pubes.
Well, that's an unrelated car honking, but I'm gonna go now.
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where all the art in every dentist's office comes from.
We got to practice doing funny double-takes upon seeing a bikini woman.
Affirmative. And, Joe, I order you to just let the binoculars fall right out of your hands, but you don't even notice
I can see that we got the right skill set for this assignment.
This is important. I want you to start acting like it.
Guys, we have to complete a 160-point inspection of this coastal patrol cutter.
I'm just like Aquaman, but I can't get fish to do things.
No, he can also breathe underwater, and he's strong, like me.
I can punch a big octopus a really long way.
Hey, can you guys keep it down for a bit?
I got to have a FaceTime conversation with my wife where we talk at the same time, and then stop, and then start again, then laugh.
Hell, you guys still don't even know how to operate a simple hydraulic grapple-winch.
Okay, that's the third time you've mentioned the hydraulic grapple-winch.
I wasn't sentenced, but I came anyway because I thought I could try and teach my friends what it means to serve their country, the way I did.
And I'm still the voice of Cris Collinsworth, and I'm done, too.
We should probably all go urinate together, outdoors, as a group of guys, while wearing backwards baseball caps, per Fort Lauderdale municipal law.
Those evil frat boys are planning to kill spring break.
And they only had time to record two lines of dialogue.
All right, let's just find a quiet place to come up with a plan.
And, Cleveland, I want you to get... buildings in the city.
Did you see all of those guns and weapons those evil frat boys had?
And we still haven't nailed down a date for visiting Epcot.
You're right. Compared to him, we're about as useless as one of those automatic bathroom sinks.
What the hell are you doing? This is a women's bathroom.
Come on, guys, we don't need Quagmire to do the right thing.
If there's gonna be an attack at spring break, we can't just stand by while people get hurt, or even killed.
Because we're in the Coast Guard, and when you're here, you're family.
We got to find those frat boys. Look for anything suspicious.
No, Peter, it's not; it's just the coolest, freshest way to keep your party rolling is what it is.
Final boarding call for the Are We Ready To Attack, We Are,
All right, everybody, freeze! This is the U.S. Coast Guard.
Are any of you familiar with what's referred to as a Leeroy Jenkins?
Well, I don't know what that is, but let's make a very long, elaborate plan.
All right, so I'll run in first and use an intimidating shout.
I'll need Joe to come in and use his shout, too.
Yeah, give me a sec. I'm coming up with, uh,
Oh, my God, he just ran in. Let's go! Stick to the plan!
From the coastal patrol cutter. Machine gun is item 49 of the 160-point inspection.
Oh, that was when I was writing homosexual stuff on the boat.
Soon you will all do the foamy dance of death.
I was thinking next Thursday for Epcot, but no bomb.
You're wasting your time; the bomb will activate the moment the floor stops vibrating.
Twerk like you're Miley Cyrus trying to prove something to your dad!
Oh, no, we're not. I stole a Jet Ski from a kid.
Eh, I was just doing my duty. Just like you did.
Anyway, what matters is everyone's okay, thanks to the Coast Guard.
Oh, hey, Brian. I was sick of waiting my turn outside the supermarket, so I bought every coin-operated horse in town.
How do you possibly have the money for this type of stuff?
For instance, there are more single people over 50 than ever.
I don't know, Stewie, if you ask me, the stock market's just a rigged game where the top one-percent make out like bandits, and regular people get hurt.
Our top story, an austere monetary policy has the European Union on the brink of collapse, threatening the entire global economy.
And for viewers making less than $40,000 a year, your top story is a big UFC fight this Saturday.
Me and the guys are gonna watch it at the Clam.
I will go to Meg's ballet recital in your place.
I asked Ms. Watson if she has any kids of her own.
Stewie, adults are allowed to say racist things because of traffic.
Well, don't get so angry. Just tell your insurance what happened and then they'll...
This sucks. Fixing the bumper is gonna cost at least a grand.
Tell you what, give me a hundred bucks to put in the stock market, and I'll take care of it.
Guess I'm not the first person to cave into family pressure.
I've got to go back to Long Island to see her.
No, no, Joe, now is not the time to use your new conversation techniques.
And there's no one to take care of her, so, unfortunately, I'll be gone for a while.
Really? Well, uh, you know, we know this place better than anyone.
Wow, you fellas would really watch this place for me?
Hey, Brian, I need to talk to you about that money I invested for you.
The stock market is a sucker's bet, like chasing your tail.
God, it's right there, and yet a million miles away.
Okay, but I can see this is going to be a lot of work.
So in return, you must teach me Gymkata: the fusion of gymnastics and karate.
Brian, there's a 22-year-old Mongolian heiress who's being held captive in a mountain fortress that happens to have a pommel horse in it.
No, no, no, no, no, no. I pooped. I pooped.
For every dollar I make, one goes to me, and one goes to charity.
I'm sorry, Billy, you're one dollar short of being able to afford the surgery you need.
In fact, we're so successful now, we have to make one of those sappy investment commercials.
Fidelity: We're there for you when your baby marries his dog-dad.
Stewie, why'd you bring me all the way out here?
Now that we're eccentric rich guys, we're going to go down 20,000 feet and pants James Cameron while he's excavating the Titanic.
I think it's because of the trivia night Quagmire started.
No phones, I'm seeing phones. In what country... No phones.
I've been pretty cool about this so far, it's a gentlemen's game. In what country can you find the monuments called...
I see phones. I see... all right, you know what, that's it, trivia night over!
Three cotton-picking weeks, and no one's gotten a single answer wrong.
Everyone's like, Hey, settle down, we're not using our phones.
Technically, you got to finish the game before you get your drink. In which country...
And you know, I think some people may be here because of me.
This is just a bunch of covers of Life Is A Highway.
Yeah, right. How can it get mad when I cinched its balls with my belt?
See, it loves it here. It's even picking out a song.
Excellent choice. You know, not to tell tales out of school, but I sucked my first jug to this song.
It's from Game of Thrones when Stannis's daughter is burned alive at the stake.
No way. It's from when Arya and that other tiny girl fight to the death.
It's the sound of a mama being stabbed right in the baby.
There's nothing left for me here, so I'm coming home tomorrow.
Yeah. When Jerome sees that painting, he's gonna kill us.
This is what you dragged me out of the house first thing in the morning for?
Yeah, it's a great company I found to invest in.
This is why I didn't want to let you have a soda in the car.
Uh, Brian, I think I know why it's so cheap.
Oh, my God, look at all those poor, sad dogs.
Oh, I tell you, I got to pay more attention, you know?
Oh, boy, I tell you, I came in this place a purebred.
Yeah, but wasn't there another case that was only thrown out because the statute of limitations had expired?
I can't believe you still want to invest in this.
And if you're too scared to do it with me, then maybe I'm working with the wrong partner.
We were a good team, like Ricki and the Flash.
Yeah, no, I didn't see it either, but, yeah, the, the Flash was the name of her rock band.
We have to paint that portrait of Jerome's mother ourselves, and this is the only class in town.
But aren't these classes just for lame chicks who want an excuse to drink together?
I have an appointment to see your CEO about an investment.
All right. Now, I'm not sure if I'm saying this right, but, uh, Boo. Cocky.
Thinking he can fire me when I'm the one who taught him?
I don't know why I put up with it, I guess...
But enough about that, I'm probably starting to bore you.
You would think, after all these years together, that I could simply tell myself enough is enough.
Stewie, it's Brian, you got to help me, I'm gonna get ea...
I always thought I'd go the way all dogs dream about: slowly, and at great inconvenience to my owners.
Here we go. Let's get you to the living room.
Lois, wrap one of his walking to the car pills in roast beef and peanut butter.
I'm gonna hold his hips while he stands confused in front of the water dish.
Oh, God. Jerome's gonna be here any minute, and then we're totally screwed.
Well, I guess all we can do now is the honorable thing: make realistic puppets of ourselves to leave in the bar for Jerome to beat the crap out of.
Well, don't just sit there staring at me with your limp limbs and your straw-filled aid shirts.
Now let's hope we can find Brian before it's too late.
Ugh, he just makes it so difficult to be on his side.
Oh, come on, there's got to be a way we can work this out.
Wow, Stewie. I am so sorry I became such a jerk.
But I guess I learned my lesson about the evils of Wall Street.
I've been investing in the market forever, and doing just fine.
You did it for one week, and were literally eating your own kind.
Where is the mother, and what kind of sex does she like to have?
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin, and I'm here at The Museum of Television & Radio to commemorate Family Guy becoming the longest-running show in television history.
For 60 years, Sunday has meant God, football and Family Guy.
Premiering in 1952 as a recurring sketch in the popular Dow Chemical Follies,
Family Guy has survived two assassination attempts, and a pretty good ribbing by those South Park guys.
Well, tonight we take a look back at classic episodes from our first three decades.
I know, I'll sit here and pretend I'm a wax figure.
Raleigh Kids Cigarettes is happy to bring you Family Guy, the story of an American family named the Griffins.
Raleigh Kids is the only cigarette made for tiny hands.
And now, Raleigh Kids, also the makers of Kinder Coffee, invites you to watch Family Guy.
If you want to have fun with your girl, try dancing.
So, what's going on if a guy says a girl has a red scare in her Harry Truman?
I'm Tom Tucker, and this is the Radio 5 news.
Our top story this evening, songsmith Elvis Presley will be appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night on that never-gonna-last fad called television.
And now a word from our sponsor: Fred Trump Apartments.
If you don't want to live with blacks, Fred Trump.
I spent our entire savings building that stupid fallout shelter we never get to use.
Why don't you just buy a TV for the weekend, watch Elvis, and then return it on Monday and say it doesn't work?
Why don't I just get a job to help pay for it?
I don't want to go to work in soft underpants like some Nancy boy; I want to go to work like this.
We got some time before Elvis. Can we see what else is on?
We now return to 1950s sci-fi, which is always a man in a silver suit battling a monster.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker, previously of Radio 5 news.
I am a 1950s man speaking in a stilted manner, seemingly with no self-awareness whatsoever.
I am shouting for some reason and will now suddenly be replaced by crude graphics.
Sorry, Peter. I wanted to tell you, but you were so dead set against it.
If God wanted women in the workplace, he'd have made them alcoholics.
Come on, Donna, let's pick up some gizzards and fried skins and head on down to the juke joint.
But I was banished to the sidewalk because I called one of the band guys a bad name.
You can keep your job so we can afford this thing.
Instead of eating in another room and talking, what if we bring the food out here and never talk again?
Try Post Raisin Bran, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
Along with germ, it is an integral part of whole grains.
When you eat Raisin Bran, it fills your stomach and keeps you from feeling the sensation of hunger. Hunger being pangs in the belly as a result of lack of nourishment, thereby sending signals to your brain telling you, Hey, I'm hungry.
And when you hear Mr. Hey, I'm Hungry, be sure to have a hearty bowl of Post Raisin Bran.
Again, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
Along with germ, it is an integral part of whole grains.
Made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried
Just working day after day, I'm exhausted, and I miss my family.
It's made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time.
So I guess we have to get rid of the TV.
By the way, Chris and Raisin Bran are at Raisin Bran practice.
The only reason I wanted to work was to make this for you.
To the moon, Lois! To the moon? Wh-What does that mean?
Like-like it's funny to hit me so violently my body will fly out of the atmosphere?
Okay, here's your highball, a grapefruit, and our one weird serrated spoon.
But sorry, there's no newspaper. Chris quit his paper route.
Me and my pals are going to Woodstock to smoke dope.
So, if you see news reports about a Roy Mitchell from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
I'm not a snitch, I just tell it like it is.
You know, Meg, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself.
And by tattling on someone, you're really just telling them, I'm a tattletale.
So, if you see any news reports about an actor named Robert Reed from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
I got to get there and bring him back before something bad happens.
Honey, I'm taking the compact; save a little on gas.
He'll be here in ten minutes. I got to hide!
What? No son of mine is gonna be smoking dope.
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse than your three martini lunch?
What?! No son of mine is gonna be drinking a three martini lunch.
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse than your five Scotch breakfast?
What?! No son of mine is gonna be drinking a five Scotch breakfast.
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse than your three X's drawn on the jug corn whiskey moonshine?
What?! No son of mine drink anything but rice wine.
That's right, we trace our early family roots to Asia.
We just want you to stay a kid a little bit longer.
I'm glad. 'Cause the thing is, Chris, drugs turn you into someone you're not.
But you know what? We love you just how you are.
That's why I'm so grateful I got here before you dropped acid or took any kind of drugs that...
Wow, Peter, your plan worked to show Chris how horrible drugs are.
Lois, why is my son playing with a vacuum like a girl?
Then you can grow up like a man, like track and field star Bruce Jenner, the greatest man in the world.
Maybe you'll even end up on a box of Wheaties.
Chris, I see in the paper that Vietnam is still going on, and as a blue collar TV dad, I demand you enlist.
You have no idea how bad it is over there.
Of course, it was 1958, so the resistance wasn't quite as stiff.
Chris, you are going to Vietnam and doing your duty, like Quagmire did.
As a matter of fact, his tour just ended and his transport should be getting in soon.
So let's head down to the airfield and give our soldiers the respect they deserve.
All right, when he comes back, we got to make him feel welcome again.
Yeah, just be careful with your collars on the way in.
Yeah, we'll have a round of beers for the table.
It's good to have you back from the war in one piece, Quagmire.
What are you talking about? You never went to Vietnam.
I went to the draft board and told them I was gay, and then got hit by a bus on the walk home.
So, Quagmire, Chris is shipping out tomorrow morning, and he's pretty nervous.
I know you enjoy staring, like, but you got any good stories I could tell him about how cool 'Nam is?
You know, there's lots of things you expect in war...
But what they don't prepare you for is the incessant use of Fortunate Son.
I'd hear that song any time I was in a helicopter.
Or taking a swift boat deep into the jungle, that song again.
My penis would even play Fortunate Son while I was visiting a whorehouse.
Hey, I just realized, your clothes kind of look like the jungle.
I got to get him out to there. I thought this war would be fun, you know, just go over there and fight the Donkey Kong.
We were trying to fight the war our way, the way we'd always fought wars, but we were gradually climbing steel beams and ladders, and the Donkey Kong knew that.
It was barrel after barrel. We lost a lot of good men.
I want you to sound off smartly and move out.
Well, that's all we got tonight. Hope you enjoyed it.
And I hope the exhibits here at The Museum of Television & Radio don't come to life like Night at the Museum.
He was a big drinker. Ask Ron Howard, he'll tell you.
Tim Conway was sleeping with half the Apple Dumpling Gang.
It's a magic genie speaker that plays music, talks and knows stuff, all without wires.
All right, let me squinch my face up and put on a pair of glasses I never wear to look at these directions.
Boy, if they were giving out medals for tiny writing...
Breaking news from The Huffington Post: Prince bred purple dolphins.
You see? Right there, this device is a perfect example of how we continue to become more inept due to our dependency upon machines.
There was a time, not too long ago, when people would talk to each other.
Possible reasons for being a loser: bad breath, arrogance, unemployment...
Top critic on Rotten Tomatoes says, I walked out of the theater, and I'm Ed Helms.
He also said, No, thanks, every hot woman, I'll take this woman crawling out of the well from The Ring who none of my friends like.
Boy, you know, I haven't stayed up all night talking like that in forever.
Customers who bought Fitbit also bought enormous exercise ball that's always in the way.
Brandee, this is very important: what's the biggest poo anyone has ever pooed?
History's largest bowel movement occurred in 1998, at a Hardee's in Memphis, by Aretha Franklin.
Shall I alert you when DickCaps.com is having another sale?
That might be the Every Shark Tank Item Ever Package.
Brian, before I go, there's something I want to tell you.
Maybe if you stopped feeling sorry for yourself, you could actually do something positive with your life.
I'm just gonna lie down on the couch with my head on the armrest to accentuate how sad I am.
You know, Brian, if I had... aw... one day in your body, I would give it back to you with a new and improved life.
I realize I've wasted most of my life being a pathetic jerk.
Wait, wait, wait. So when you said spend a day in my body, you were being literal?
This device will allow me to inhabit your body, and you, mine.
That way, I can fix your life, and then, return your body to you.
I chose the one where my voice will be coming from your body, and vice-versa.
Still, from time to time, we will have to imitate the other person's voice to fool those who don't know what we've done, which is everyone.
Fine. But just for the record, every device you've ever made has broken at some crucial juncture.
I'll see you on the other side... of your eyes.
All right, all right, I think, I think I'm getting it.
Okay, I'm off to get you a job, a girlfriend, and onto the road less scummy.
So how exactly are you planning to get me a job here?
My research shows that every seven minutes, a professor is fired for having sex with one of his students.
Who haven't had sex with a student or tweeted about assassinating the president?
Please open your books to the introduction, which defines what poetry is.
Well, it's a long story, but I was really hoping to come home with a job and a girlfriend today.
I could be your girlfriend, and give you a job.
Also, I know this is a big inconvenience, but you and the trash guy now wave to each other.
Oh, and you're gonna hate this, but I gave him the salute, so you're a salute guy now.
Just a few more seconds, and we'll be back to normal.
If I'm in Chris's body, he must be in mine.
What the hell's going on? What happened to my body?
He's panicking. We can't let him know what's going on.
Well, here you go, about to put you in front of the mirror.
There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all
But I'm not tired! I want to go to the Clam and...
If I can't fix it, we'll be like this forever.
This is a total disaster, like when the fat man tried to keep Michael Shannon from going insane.
Hey, Peter, I'm gonna need you to fill out your time card.
Yeah, sure, I'll have it by the end of the day.
We now return to a human hand rolling a ball of clay.
Stewie, enough of that. We have to fix the machine.
Oh, uh, wish I could, Glenn. Sure could go for a pomtini.
But, unfortunately, I've got to help my son Chris with his homework.
Hey, I realized I can reach the animal crackers, so I'm actually gonna be a while.
This is the weekend we're going to Dr. Johann's retreat.
Oh, uh, of course. Uh, remind me what that is again.
It's the couples' sex seminar where the husband learns how to give his wife an orgasm.
Wait, are you saying... we have to have sex this weekend?
Uh, I-I was simply thunderstruck at the prospect of intercoursing you. Darling.
Lois signed us up for some perverse, pee-pee-related class on the female orgasm. She's crazed.
You've got to get here with the machine so I can fix it.
Right. So I can take your place in Peter's body.
If we hurry, we can get there before Stewie's scarred for life.
Yeah, well, why do I have the overwhelming urge to eat Cheetos and masturbate in the woods?
Okay, everyone, please put your bananas and donuts back on the table, we're done with that exercise.
I'm confused as hell, but I'm enjoying these graham crackers, so I'm not gonna say anything.
You owe my wife 100 bucks for a lavatory misunderstanding.
Joe, thank God. We need to get to the Weekapaug Inn, fast.
I'm standing here for some reason doing the weather in a giant black man's body.
This just in, all kids report to the blue van in the park at 3:00 p.m. for free Popsicles.
Don't do it. Don't do what I was gonna do.
Ho-ho! Is funny 'cause different voices are coming out of different mouths.
Uh, one moment while I Desitin my junk in the bathroom.
Lois just asked me if I want to see her kid's first apartment.
We hit a telephone pole, the machine activated, and it swapped everybody in town.
All right, now you got to reverse the voltage orientation and amplify the electron flow to the motherboard.
Stewie, just say it in English or so help me God,
I will hang up and make you screw your mom.
Stewie, I see the wires, but Chris's pudgy fingers won't fit inside the panel.
Okay, just use his tiny hands to switch the black and yellow wires.
Great. Now we need to find an energy source powerful enough to match the electrical surge that swapped the town in the first place.
According to my GPS, you're 20 feet from the base of the Quahog cell phone tower.
Now I need you to strap the body swapper on your back and climb to the top of the tower.
You didn't listen to a word Dr. Johann said, did you?
Sales are down across the board, but mostly we're failing to connect with a group called millennials.
To learn more about our target demographic, we're all gonna watch this instructional video.
A millennial can be defined as anyone born between 1982 and 2000.
Or anyone who thinks loving sriracha or Austin, Texas, counts as a personality.
Millennials crave things like: instant gratification, authentic experiences, and, for some reason we haven't figured out yet, improv comedy.
Here's one millennial who has a parakeet with nine million followers on Snapchat.
Here's another who singlehandedly started the hashtags that cancelled she found offensive.
And now I'm told she identifies as a man, so I'm being fired.
So please welcome someone who's gonna help us reach millennials, our new head of social media, Hammer.
And now here comes a text from the guy who doesn't know this is a group text. Nice to meet you, Hammer. Let's have lunch later, and I'll tell you who's gay.
Uh, first I'd like to not thank you for hiring me, because I just expect good things to happen to me without working for them.
Second, I'd like to give you all a list of my trigger warnings.
Actually, brah, asking me what a trigger warning is is one of my triggers, brah.
Now, if we want to get some social media attention, we got to start with a group selfie.
Um, excuse me. Didn't Ellen do this, like, three years ago?
Do you know what I just did? I just made you all viral.
Also, my band is playing tonight at an inconvenient time.
It's six un-showered guys and a pale woman with a ukulele shouting Hey! in unison.
That's because anytime someone walks through a cloud of vape smoke, a millennial is born.
There it is. Grossly exaggerating the quality of a just-okay TV show.
Peter, a rite of passage for any millennial is attending Coachella.
It's a great place to see bands that are either really new or really old.
Well, on the main stage, it's Tame Impala that formed in an UberPOOL on the way here.
And on the side stage, it's Neil Young asleep in front of the television.
I always get him confused with Bloom County's Bill the Cat.
Next thing is you got to learn how to be on Fleek. On fleek? People still say on fleek?
Our country's involved in six different wars, but millennials think about this stuff.
Remember, Peter, never walk anywhere when you can ride something weird instead.
What's that? Sorry, I was taking a selfie while shooting a Snapchat while Periscoping that Snapchat while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming The Weekend while streaming Master of None while retweeting George Takei while saying, This wins the Internet! while still being soooo bored.
Hammer? Come on, man, don't make me look up from my phone.
Peter, if I die, chop my body up and serve me as street tacos.
It seems so obvious, yet I don't think I've ever seen them.
Three... ugh, I'm gonna let my parents take care of this.
Yeah, it seems in poor taste that they hired Keyboard Cat.
Listen, I made breakfast and drove, so if there's a dead dong, I'm gonna look at it!
We've all lost a great friend-slash-barista- slash-deejay- slash-Genius Bar employee- slash-person with a yellow highlighter at the Best Buy exit.
And now a reading from the book of JustJared. Death be the ultimate fail.
Peter, I hate to do this here, but you were good friends with Hammer, and business at the brewery must go on.
He's very aware of what's going on here, you see.
All right, guys, I got to come up with some social media ideas for the brewery. What do ya got?
No, guys, we need social media-specific plans to reach a younger audience.
You know what? I give up. We've given this... what, almost a minute?
We'll do a show for people with no attention span.
Well, I guess that could work. But it's just so sad that young people can't pay attention to something longer than six sec...
You know, there's more to life than just what's on your phone.
I'm Peter Griffin, and this is the Six Second Talk Show.
And that's all the time we have. Thanks for watching. Good night.
It's The Six Second Talk Show, and now, your host, here...
I'm Peter Griffin, and now our musical guest, Barenaked Ladies.
Peter, I can't believe your talk show is such a huge hit for the brewery.
And thanks to that, I'm now a huge social media star.
I'm Parker Stanton, CEO of Boop, the most powerful company in Silicon Valley.
Look, Peter, the reason I'm here is because of your Six Second Talk Show.
Now, I haven't had the time to watch it, but I hear it's the buzz of Silicon Valley.
I want you and your family to visit us here as my guests, so I can find out what the next big thing is.
I've been working on something called Look At It, Kick It.
Oh, except that trip to Europe where we spent most of our time trying to refold our map.
All right, the museum is that way, so let's fold the map and go.
I'd be able to find the creases if somebody had folded it correctly last time.
Nope, you didn't, and then, you jammed it into a backpack and now I'm in this mess.
Don't blame me, you ripped it up when you were tearing through the backpack for your snacks.
Okay, this is why I wanted to bring a globe, all right?
See, Bon? We're eating food, and they're tearing each other apart.
As our name suggests, our mainframe connects to and powers virtually every server on the globe.
Hey, Parker. Are we still on for the Samsung Galaxy Note meeting after lunch?
I had to admire his courage for leaving his penis out the entire time I was yelling at him.
I couldn't help but be impressed by that kind of self-confidence.
Years later, we would bump into each other at a small cafe in Rome and reminisce about this moment.
And later still, recreate it in a small bed and breakfast at the bottom of the Spanish Steps.
Peter, you've done some stupid things, but crashing the Internet has to be the dumbest yet.
I'm sure life will be just fine without the Internet.
Anyone here from the back fields of Pennsylvania, Ohio or upstate New York?
There's no Internet, which means there's no GPS, which means we can't use Uber.
Now, because you can't stare at your phone anymore, enjoy a disturbingly loud clip of Jimmy Fallon on cab TV.
Tonight, get ready to lose all respect for Al Pacino when I force him to play a game meant for children!
It's even worse than when I was roommates with Oscar Pistorius.
We can do all the things we loved about the Internet.
From now on, if you want to tweet something, you do it the old-fashioned way: write it on a piece of paper, staple it to a bird, and throw it out the door.
Great news, Chris. I figured out how to recreate the best part of the Internet.
I've got pictures of five celebrities who you'd never believe used to be fat.
But first you have to watch this unwelcome pop-up ad.
Oh, no! You pressed in the wrong place, and now you're being sent to the ad's website, which also has additional pop-ups.
Would you like to upgrade to an ad-free experience for $4.99?
Oh, this is just my looping GIF of black teens reacting to a very mild burn.
We just need a big bag and a lot of rice.
We'll just have to roll up our sleeves and do the best we can, like the men who built New York City.
Men, creating an entire subway system out of nothing is grueling, thankless, life-threatening work.
But just remember: we're doing this so that one day, future commuters can be hassled by panhandlers and amateur break-dancers.
Is it me, or does David Ortiz look just like the mom on Good Times?
Hey, guys, guess who's got the keys to a speedboat just sitting down at the station?
Anything to get out on the open water, enjoy the salt air.
Good evening, Quahog. Just parking. Be there in a sec.
Our top story: authorities have uncovered a mob-run prescription drug ring targeting Goldman's Pharmacy.
Pharmacist Mort Goldman failed to report to authorities for questioning.
Besides, we haven't done anything together since our confusing two-host talk show.
So, Chris Pratt, I hear you have a new movie out.
Hey, Chris, anything you can tell us about Guardians 3?
Hey, you want some help? I do this all the time.
Mort must have panicked after the pharmacy bust and fled town.
If we're gonna collect our ten grand, we need to figure out where he went.
How about This fish is cold, I want a refund?
I know the answer is no, but is there any chance there's time for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?
Man, that guy can get anyone to do that to him.
You just got to wipe that squashed tomato off your crotch.
All right, we got to let all the other boats know.
White flag for friendly, black for not friendly, blue flag for penis loss?
Doc, give it to us straight. What's going on with our friend?
Well, Mr. Griffin, there's no easy way to put this, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
Oh, him. Well, Mr. Quagmire, you've had quite the nasty shark attack.
But you're going to have to learn to live without a penis.
I play that with my penis-less patients to lighten the mood.
At least you're not this pathetic guy who couldn't get his boat in the water.
You should take his wiener. He's clearly not using it.
Ah, that... that does... that does make me feel better.
Hang on. I'm in the middle of writing a song.
We're looking for a friend who's hiding out down here.
And here's Pitbull with his newest hit, Tingta Tongka Te Tong Tong Tink.
I got to go get paid to scream Make some noise! in Vegas.
It's been five days now. Why won't you just cooperate?!
We're taking you back to Quahog to collect our reward.
You could devote your life to Christ, or become a eunuch.
Listen, Quagmire, I got just the way for you to embrace your new life without a penis.
I've had this computer blocked so you can discover all the other exciting things
I like to research birds. Try to learn a bird a day.
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, guys, but this is a disaster.
Florida. Which, interesting trivia, was the name of the mom in Good Times played by David Ortiz.
No, we're not. I'm the fastest Jew in the world.
And those greens are playing very fast, so he's gonna have to use caution on his approach.
And he hits a great shot, right on the green.
Well, I'm looking for a place with good schools, and, because he works in the city, he's looking for an easy commute.
Yeah, she teaches here at the high school and I work in town as a choreographer and florist.
I just came by to thank you for giving me the kick in the pants I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself
And I wanted to invite you guys to the opening of my new show at the Quahog Playhouse.
Now I got to go to this thing! Ugh! Bite me!
Oh, I'm so glad Quagmire's back on his feet again.
What a great crowd, huh, Edgar? This is gonna be a fun night.
You're talking to a wooden doll to make up for the fact that you can't have sex anymore.
Besides, if you've got all the answers, what do you suggest?
Blow your [BLEEP] brains out in front of all these people.
I-I got a lot to live for according to everybody.
Oh, God, Peter's here. I so don't want to talk to him.
Yeah, on second thought, maybe you should hold this, Cleveland.
Are you really gonna just sit there after all the crap white people have given you your whole life?
Quagmire, why the hell would you want to kill yourself?
You want to know why? Because I can't do this anymore.
You want impossible, try eating local pizza with a guy from New York.
I told them Mort gave us his flash drive with enough evidence to put them all in jail.
We're going to trade it for Mort and collect our money.
I can support his lifestyle and still think it's weird!
I knew you were down in the dumps, so I brought you something to cheer you up.
Next to a snowball from the winter, if you can believe that.
If you don't, I'm just gonna give it to Paul Ryan.
I know, but it's nice that they served hot dogs for the surgery.
You've given me the greatest gift I could ever ask for.
I'm not sure about urination or sex, but otherwise, yes.
Don't worry, that'll go away once you fill your prescription at Goldman's Pharmacy.
I'm trying to get more involved in the writing this season.
In fact, I think Family Guy should be more of a dramedy.
Well, for one thing, the scenes don't have to end with jokes.
Now, again, I don't know why we couldn't have done this by Dropbox.
I mean, I don't mind coming here to a parking lot...
And you wouldn't have to mail me back my flash drive.
Well, Brian, we may not have gotten the $10,000, but it'll be a joy to hear no more Jewish talk for a long while. Brian and Stewie laugh. The image freezes.
My dad didn't mention there's a four-inch mole on the left side.
I try to tell them it's my dad's old penis, but that, um... that just tends to make it worse.
Well, I'm just glad our friend's back to his old self.
It's great that we can be there for each other in trying times.
They've been practicing for months. For months, or four months?
I just wish we were doing songs that weren't so hard to sing as a group.
Six o'clock, TV hours, don't get caught in foreign tower
We now return to a 1980s movie you remember fondly, but now feels excruciatingly slow.
I hope you don't plan on just lying on the couch and watching TV all weekend.
Well, just expect me to do a lot of sour-faced, arms-folded head shaking.
Well, in return, you'll get a lot of beaten-down husband eye-rolls.
One of the neighbors called about a passive-aggressive domestic dispute.
I don't need you to. I got a thousand dollar credit from Uber Eats 'cause that driver pinched my bottom.
Okay, well if you don't get up, I won't have sex with you.
Peter, come out here and high five us over the sex someone else had.
Hi, I'm Oliver Platt, and I'm currently fused to this chair.
When a fat guy's sweaty skin presses against couch fabric for an extended period of time, the fabric fibers fuse together with the skin.
Being fused to furniture hasn't stopped me from being an adult with a child's name.
Hey, what's up? I'm Snoop Dogg, know what I'm saying?
Hey, what's it like going through life holding needles in your lips?
Some-a time-a the needle, they poke-a my lip, and I say-a, Mamma mia!
Well, you still got James Brolin coming in here, autographing your photos.
And now to say good night to all-a my celebrity pictures on-a the wall.
And now, to say good night to my favorite-a celebrity,
You take-a good care of the place while I'm-a gone, William-a Katt.
Was I always able to see the living room from the kitchen?
If Peter won't let Dr. Hartman remove it, we're doing it ourselves.
I put an Ambien in his beer, so he's out cold.
Every adult has to take Ambien every night to even have a prayer at sleep.
All right, kids, we're gonna use these scissors to separate your father from the couch.
I work my ass off to bring home the bacon for this family, and all you can say is, We don't want bacon, we want actual money!
Well, I don't have money, I spent it all on bacon!
I can't. My feet swelled up too much from all the bacon.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sleep on the couch on the couch.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Just look down, all right? Just-just look at me, look what I'm doing. All right, see the way I'm twisting it?
You know what? All right, just... Hang... just put-put it down.
All right, let's... Let's just hang on and figure this out.
All right. Okay. I-I got it. I know what we're gonna...
Okay, okay. All right, y-you... We... here's what we're gonna do,
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler.
I can't believe I'm stuck in an elevator with God.
Although, I guess you are everywhere, and in all places.
I don't remember things exactly as they do, but I respect their experience.
Well, you had a couch attached to your back, and you fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty hard.
It was an HBO show starring a bottle of hair dye.
Hey, can you use your God powers to get us out?
I always dreamed of being stuck in an elevator with Tom Brady.
How about people who say they are not religious, but they are spiritual?
Sometimes, I pull them out just so they think everything is gonna be okay, but then, I put them right back in.
Um, God, here's something you might be able to tell me.
Will Taylor Swift and Katy Perry ever reconcile their differences?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm looking for the gay guy who can answer that one.
Some people say we're just a computer simulation run by a higher species.
I'll stick with this pile of crap I already have.
Let me finish. You were Henry, the eighth guy to have sex with Rock Hudson at one of his pool parties.
I like to believe there's something bigger than me out there keeping a watch out.
The idea that I may exist is enough for some people to behave better.
When I used to ask my mom what God was, she would say, God is love. I always liked that.
Ha! I always forget you're such a Star Wars guy.
It's not broken. I just haven't decided where it's going yet.
Since you're now a ghost, would you like to do pottery while straddling present-day Demi Moore?
I feel like the bones in her back would hurt my tummy.
Well, if you weren't dead, would you feel nothing when I do this?
Oh, you know what? That's right, it takes a day.
But I can't be. Hold on, give me a sec.
I can't be dead. I have a family who needs me.
I think your family would be better off without you.
Oh, please. He played that for all it was worth. Why has thou forsaken me?
But come on, God, you gotta give me another chance.
I'll show you how good a husband and father I can be.
I'll give you one day to prove to me that your family is better off with you alive.
I'll return you to your life before you were in a coma.
Okay, kids. I know how you always wanted kittens, so guess what I brought home?
Now, we all need to do our part to help with the birth.
Isn't it nice that we're spending this time together as a family?
Well, look at us. Out for a fun family dinner.
At least Meg went wild and got a beige burger.
You're all gonna get up, go back up to that toppings bar, and go nuts.
It's not supposed to taste good. It's supposed to look crazy.
Half of it is supposed to fall onto your plate when you squeeze it, and the rest goes onto your shirt.
See, look, now I have to be even more ridiculous to make up for what you guys aren't doing.
Yeah, they're saying, Look at the creative guy. Look at King Fuddrucker over there. Usually you put a burger on a tray.
And prepare to fish my teeth out of my stool.
I'm sure when you explain what we're supposed to get, we'll get it.
I'll miss you more than life... the cereal, but not the board game, which I quite enjoy.
I'm sorry I'll never get a chance to walk you down the aisle... at Costco, to furnish your sad, single-lady apartment.
And Stewie, it kills me that I'll never see you become a man... loving twink.
I want you to remember to always reach for the Stars...
Sky and Hutch DVD that fell behind the entertainment center.
Peter, what's going on? Why are you saying these things?
I'm gonna stay out here and listen to Nina Blackwood slowly die of throat cancer on the radio.
Our next artist first climbed the charts with Dancing With Myself.
I'm supposed to get her a week from Thursday, but I may be moving that up.
It's weird. For the first seven days, all I did was create things, but since then, it's just killing, killing, killing.
Hey, Chris, you like pictures of naked children because you're gross and weird.
Well, Lois, let's just say the big man upstairs put in a hard day's work today.
Brian, why are you dressed like a douche who hangs out with multiracial friends in a McDonald's commercial?
Hey, Brian, that hat makes you look like a wang.
Let me guess, Bri. You're off to try and get laid
I want a woman who I can spend the rest of my life with.
And you never will, because the truth is you're a selfish horndog who's getting too old for the game.
I beg to differ. I think I've got the lingo of today's lady down pat.
How about the Verizon guy moving over to Sprint? Huh?
So, this place, uh... it's worse than Syria, don't you think?
Oh, my God, we were grumpy and bitter at the same time.
And hey, sorry I barked when you took your pants off.
I'm still recovering from that one thing you did that was so obscene, it couldn't even be described on lame, dying network TV.
I made a bucket list of wild sex stuff I want to try.
Jess, I would like to help you cross off every single item on this list.
And when she gets back from the bathroom, none of you say anything about cancer.
I'm serious. I really enjoy spending time with this woman, and I don't want you ruining it for me.
Lois, you didn't have to go through all this trouble.
Oh, man, I love every Tom Hanks movie, except The Terminal.
There's nothing worse than when you're flipping channels, and you're like, Oh, God, it's Terminal. Don't say it's Terminal. God, what have I done to deserve this?
Sir, I will tell you a great Tom Hanks movie:
Well, I've never told you that I can't throw a boomerang, but it's true.
See? I told you. But at least I don't have cancer,
I can't remember the last time I felt this happy.
I'm afraid Jess's condition is too serious to be announced by Dr. Hartman.
The cancer did not respond to treatment and has spread throughout your body.
I mean, you don't even need to be here right now.
I'm just some woman who never got to have the career she wanted or get married or have kids.
It would be my honor if you spent the rest of your life as my bride.
Brian? It would mean the world to me if you wore my tux from when I got married.
And... Wha... Is this a flap on the butt of these pants?
Are you about to walk down the aisle and afraid you'll leave it brown?
But every year when I go to the Emmys, the heat I'm packin' is clumpy and smells terrible.
Want to know why? 555 means it is not an actual phone number.
Brian, I want nothing to do with this sham wedding.
So if you're going to ask me to be your best man, don't.
I'm not. I want you to be the ring bearer, and wear a vest and a boutonniere
But it's still wrong. There's no way you'd be marrying this woman if she wasn't going to die
Did you know that Lois was so moved she called Channel Five to do a profile of me and Jess?
And now get out your tissues, it's a real-life Quahog version of The Fault in Our Stars, the novel and hit movie your gay nephew quotes on Facebook.
It may have started in my penis, but it spread to my heart.
And, Brian, when you learned Jess had only weeks to live, you proposed.
You know, sometimes at night I just watch Jess sleep for hours.
And she says, Yeah, and then I go, All right, good.
Listen, I want to throw you the wildest bachelor party of all time. It's gonna be crazier than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.
I'm giving this lasagna a massage while preparing to announce I'm joining ISIS.
Hmm. I still think the butter cream was the best cake I've thrown up so far.
Oh, my God, we saw you on the news last night!
I'm not sure that's a complete number, but I'm gonna call you first.
Wow. I haven't gotten this kind of attention since I went to see The Peanuts Movie.
That's the guy who peed in his empty soda cup.
I-I was thinking maybe you could move in with me and Jess, because I-I know you'd want to be with her for her final days.
That is such a sweet offer. I would love to be there.
We's all gathered here to join this couple in holy matrimony.
I feel like you've given me a lifetime of love.
I vow to honor you and cherish you until the day I die, a week from Wednesday.
I'm so happy to place this ring on the weird dog thumb you have halfway up your arm.
But what we have is this moment, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
With this ring, I vow to honor you and cherish you... for the rest of the month.
Ma'am, do you take this doggie to be your husband?
Yeah, I took half of one before I got in the car.
Come on. It was prescribed by a doctor to a guy named John Selvaggio who has a mailbox that he can't see from his front yard.
Tinazidine: the white, plastic pouch in your neighbor's mailbox that might be three months of drugs.
Oh, my God. It is so incredible having my appetite back.
Oh, my God, I must have, like, six months worth of cancer-farts built up.
Aw, you're so glad to be back with me, aren't you?
Mommy was so sad when she had to put you all up for adoption.
Ooh, I'm going straight to the kitchen to make my favorite meal in a tiny apartment: microwaved salmon.
That's Lou, the apartment manager from when Brian moved out.
Hey, listen, thanks for renting to us even though we have ten cats and couldn't make the deposit.
Spent, uh, pretty much every last penny on our wedding.
I was going to help you move in but you don't really own anything, do you?
Yeah, we didn't bother to register for gifts because she was supposed to die!
Oh, that'll go over well after you paraded your great love around town.
Which reminds me, your follow-up Tom Tucker profile is coming on now.
We got countless letters after our profile of the Cancer Girl who won her sweetheart's paw in marriage.
You look like a baby doll found in hurricane rubble.
Coming to live with you, like you asked me to at the wedding.
We can spend the extra money on the big photos of fetuses I hold while I yell at people outside Panera.
It's all about how she's having her period, but the other guy she wanted to impress...
He walks in while she's singing, so now he's not into her, either.
Well, I'm sorry it's so disgusting, but that's all they have.
Oh, you're gonna die if you have to eat mild salsa?
Damn it. I've got one song by Haim on my phone?
That's not an invitation to ruin our moment to expand your media empire.
I'd like to thank you all for coming to honor the memory of my beloved wife Jess...
I'm sorry, I'm just realizing I never caught her last name.
But what I didn't know was... just how much I was gonna miss Jess.
I would give anything if she were still here with me.
Other way, other way, you're twisting it the wrong way.
Even more recently, and not quite as good, on  Family Guy...
And now, the current, better-than-the-pilot- but-not-as-good- as-Star-Wars-episode of Family Guy.
Sorry it took us so long to have dinner together.
Did you warn this guy when he married you he also married your friends?
Sorry, Meg found pictures on your father's computer, and she's blackmailing us.
She can do what she wants till we get some dirt on her.
I didn't know it was supposed to be hard before I took the picture.
That don't make sense. This isn't the Red Rock Motor Lodge in Montgomery, Alabama.
Please send the lawsuit to our lawyer, whose address is below.
I don't have bedbugs. I'm burning it down so I can fake my own death.
I mean, I literally don't know where socks come from.
Get a hole in one, new pair shows up in my drawer, just like that.
Food, too. I chucked the mustard onto the front lawn last week.
We're gonna have a great adventure, like the astronaut who thinks the lowest number is three.
A place just for married guys like you and me.
Wearing the ring also makes you wear giant khaki shorts with a belt and a lot of keys rattling around in the pockets.
I even got one shed that just has an extra shed in it.
Well, yeah, Brian. Every man's true weight is at least 20 pounds heavier than how they look.
You know how much energy it takes to hold all that in?
Exhale like you never have to attract a pretty woman ever again.
Oh, looks like they really want me to come to that party.
No, thanks. I'm using a pager. Oh, you're looking at your steps?
Complete with the popular kid who's clearly going to die in a car accident tonight.
Hey, Jagger, can you help out at the soup kitchen
I only have one, but it's a Stussy hat with a flat brim.
Stewie, don't say my name! There's an Alexa in here!
I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands are a little worried about you.
No, because I'm not a Skidmore freshman at a Lake George share-house.
This put an end to off-campus drinking and lake house rentals.
I'm not re what dysplasia is, but I do know you don't often see a Y that far up in a word.
I took the liberty of X-raying my own hip to show you what a normal one looks like.
Why does it look like there's a Batmobile in your colon?
I was hoping, whenever the Bat-Signal goes up in the sky,
And he won't be able to walk until his hip heals.
Like you took care of me when I was sick.
Come back in a week, we can check your pfft-pfft.
Stewie, if Mom and Dad see you with that thing, they'll kill me.
It can't be bad for you if Stephen Dorff gave up acting for it.
It tastes great and I don't feel violently ill as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs.
Plus, when you wake at night shaking because you haven't had any in three hours, it's so easy to vape more.
Let's face it, this is the most fun we've had since Mom got hooked on coffee and bought that Alpuccino maker.
Sometimes it's been difficult to cook with all the other things I have to do for Brian.
She even set up surgery for me to have my hip fixed.
Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive.
Says right here I got to euthanize Brian Griffin, and you're him.
Seriously, I'm absolutely jonesing right now, so give it back.
And if that's not bad enough, you leave it out for Stewie to get his hands on it?
Now look what you did, you little son of a bitch.
Technically, that was not my vape pen, but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine.
We accidentally switched jackets, not unlike that episode of The Brady Bunch when Greg...
Oh, damn it, Chris, why do your lies have to take so damn long?
No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette like frustrated mothers are supposed to do.
Vaping is just as bad, and you look like a douchebag.
Damn it. Now I have to do that with every dictionary here.
I'm warning you, if you kill me, the Internet's gonna freak out.
Well, for 200 bucks, I'll strangle you with my bare hands and stare into your eyes as you die.
Explain what? How you brought me here to have me killed?
You could have saved my life in the restaurant, but you let me choke to death.
Okay, fine. I probably could have done more to save your life.
I guess I felt letting you choke was my only way out.
W-Well, and I should've kept taking care of you, instead of bringing you here to have you killed.
Maybe I deserve to be with someone who let me die.
I mean, gosh, maybe that's what true marriage is... two people who want each other to die.
Oh, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died during the commercial break, but it was a very nice funeral service.
She was the love of my life, my heart, my...
Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret after you lied to me about sneaking cigarettes?
Are you serious, Peter? You said you wouldn't say anything.
Chris, the only reason I told him was he promised he'd keep his mouth shut.
I should've known not to trust someone who kisses his own brother.
At last, I shall exact my vengeance and snuff out the miserable flame that has been your life, vile woman.
Grown men who have never had sexual relations fly them over people's houses to try and see something. I don't know.
But seriously, cross me again, and I will end you.
I said we were going to bask in Robbins' glow.
Sheesh, your head is the size of a picnic watermelon.
And you sound like you were lost at sea and told not to drink seawater but drank seawater.
Peter, I was once a lot like you: unmotivated, dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways...
But first, here's that cutaway I was gonna do before you made me skip it.
Only now it'll make no sense. Cast of Parks and Rec Peter away!
If I get soaked in the rain, I'll be too heavy to move.
Peter, I've seen thousands of people over the years and helped every single one of them.
I'm not going to let you be my first failure.
I won't stop trying to help you no matter what.
Stewie, you're, like, 100 times more advanced than that kid.
Why do you want to hang out with him so badly?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Like when I finally built the Leaning Tower of Pisa out of LEGOS.
That may be true, but the lightning bolt that killed me seems to have magically transferred my personal power...
Peter, I told you I was going to help you, and I'm not leaving until I make good on my promise.
Hey, if you're dead, can you ask Bill Paxton if he's the same as Bill Pullman?
Any time someone says a weapon is not what it is,
Come downstairs. I made your favorites: grilled cheese cut to look like a dinosaur.
Well, I hope you don't use your guns to kill your mom or do anything bad.
I won't be able to play with you, and that's my favorite thing now.
And I always tell it like it is, like when I used to write tombstones.
Wait, you're not mad I went without you, are you?
And maybe to taunt the animals that aren't able to leave.
All right, you have to take us to lunch, but first we need to take our nap.
No one will respect you until you respect yourself first.
I got the role during the two months I was a hot actor, and now they're stuck with me.
Even as a toy you can't tell where he's looking.
I take up a great deal of the teacher's time.
Oh, you're a... you're a real student of the human condition, aren't you?
Ha. That's what the baby used to say when I was your age.
It must be weird having only women come over to see Mommy.
In fact, today, I'm gonna ask for... nay, demand a raise. Nay? Wow.
This new you is a bigger surprise than when they're making fun of a celebrity on Saturday Night Live and the real-life celebrity walks in behind them.
Yeah, can you imagine how mad the celebrity would be?
I mean, wherever they are at this particular moment, if they're watching, they must be...
I demanded a raise just like you told me to and they gave it to me.
I was created by lightning, Peter, in a lab, like Frankenstein.
I climbed into your trunk and that's where I've been living the past week.
So, whenever I heard your voice, that was just you in the trunk?
I wasn't going to let you be my first failure.
Wow, Tony, I don't know how I can possibly thank you.
Hey, everybody, we want to give a special shout-out to little Hudson on his birthday.
I-I just... I saw how you were connecting with Hudson and I-I was afraid of losing our friendship.
No. Friends are people who come in and out of our lives.
I'm even going to make a speech at your wedding.
So Brian and I are down in Mexico, and, as usual, he doesn't have any cash on him.
That's probably why your parents are paying for all this, right, Evan?
So, now that you got me back as a friend, what are all the great things you have planned for us?
And you were such a jealous little bitch that you had to ruin the one friendship I really cared about.
You're just a big jerk and I hate you, and there's nothing you can do to make up for it.
Maybe I'll just go out and get some ice cream.
Yeah, I don't know. I think it's more of a bigger kid thing.
No, no, no! No. I've had ice cream, like, six times.
You know, Brian, I'm starting to think we're going to get through our... Rocky Road.
We had a lot of laughs tonight, but let's remember the important thing: you can't put a price on your happiness, which is why I have: it's $6,000.
It was the only thing this little guy could do.
He was too light for the caterpillar slide, too short for the piñata, and too scared to touch the animals in the petting zoo.
In fact, I'm gonna put it where you can never reach it.
All right, try to make this sound gay: next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.
After that, I'll be taking the role of Major Dixon Butts, then Senator Rod Clutcher.
Well, we'll just see who's the bigger man. Brian, sorry I got testy. Let's bury the hatchet. If you're free, I'd love to hear about any new writing projects you're working...
Hey, Stewie, I got your text. What am I working on?
Well, first off, I got this screenplay for Tom Cruise, about the queen's private secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.
Well, Brian, you seemed to enjoy belittling me, so I decided to belittle you.
I think my excitement is best expressed by Jean-Claude Van Damme in this scene.
And... all four chairs would totally turn for you on The Voice.
And the way you salute and point is very casual and free of affectation.
You know, I'm really flattered you think all four Voice chairs would turn around.
Alicia Keys, and then Kelly Clarkson, whose chair I imagine would turn last,
But I'm a millennial, so first I have to watch a YouTube instructional video on how to do it.
I'm Corey, and today I'm gonna teach you how to get your friend out of a rat hole.
Now, before we get started, don't forget to subscribe to my channel, Corey's World.
And, guys, I'll get to as many comments as I can, but I can't get to all of them.
And don't forget to check out my other videos, like How to Play Guitar.
But in the meantime, they say if you put your finger in a rat's butt, that disables it.
Hey, come on, guy. Hey, you don't want to do this.
Please tell me that's not the finger you stuck in a rat's butt.
No. It... I don't-I don't remember which one it was.
I hate my life and nobody can hear me say it right now!
Okay, everyone, dump your toenails in the hall, I'm vacuuming.
We've got to get down from here. Quick, pass me that baggie.
How am I supposed to get down? That was the only baggie.
Use either the tampon strings or the discarded dental floss and rappel down.
Dude, dude, you got to get down here, by the big trash can.
We'll just climb the lattice on the front of the house.
Well, every '80s movie had one, so the fat man thought we should have one, too.
You know, it's funny, you said every '80s movie, but I can't think of a single one.
But the lattice thing sounded right when you said it.
I mean, she was being ignored most of the movie.
You know, it was probably greenlit in the '80s, when lattices were still a thing.
All right, Brian, at this size, this is a two-man job.
While I adjust the settings, you go over there and hit the tiny button to fire it up.
Wait, did you hit the tiny button or the button that says tiny?
I didn't say, Hit the big button that says 'tiny, '
The one you pressed is going to shrink us down to microscopic size!
I had to make it big enough to write tiny on it!
Ah, I just wish my hot girlfriend were here to see it.
Girly Friendston, you stop mooning over that boyfriend of yours and get down here this instant.
I hope he can terminate some of the bad attitudes on our kids, huh?
One of the most dominant species of the micro world.
They're also known as a moss piglet or a tardigrade.
You can call me tardy, but I'm always on time.
You'll see that we have quite the diverse cast of characters.
I'm the country water bear. Yee-haw is what I say.
I can't believe there's this whole universe hidden here in your rug... where everyone speaks English.
And I'm the gay one, but I'm not, like, doing the gay voice.
Listen, Stewie and I come from a place where water flows like... well, water.
And if you guys help us, we'll make sure you never want for water again.
I think this is a conversation best had over dinner.
Sometimes she fakes it so I can't hump her, but this seems legit.
So, uh, shouldn't we talk about what you found at our house?
I don't know. It's so late. I have a crazy idea.
Sir? Sir, I asked you what you found out about the house.
If we get inside, I can remotely hack into the shrink ray.
All right. The laptop is now linked to the shrink ray.
The only problem is that I can't activate it from here.
We still somehow have to press the return button on the keyboard.
But at this size, there's no way I can do it alone.
Thank you, Tiny Tom Cruise. How can we ever repay you?
Well, you could make a sizable donation to the Church of Spaceship Beep Boop.
And we won't get in trouble because we didn't use the actual name.
But he's so talented and he's got so many drugs.
You know, today you officially become the oldest woman I've ever slept with.
Yeah, but I'm sure Daddy had a last-minute work thing.
Even growing up, he never came to any of my piano recitals.
It was the '80s, so he was always doing cocaine-and-sushi business meetings.
I know. I thought I'd apologize with an upper-class New England mumble-kiss.
I can't believe you'd blow off my party then give me a handgun.
I'm trying to explain that guns are hazardous and unsafe, not have a conversation about a tepid 1990s Canadian sketch group.
There's a bunch of 'em, they got to be good.
Yeah, my father gave me a gun as a present yesterday.
Anyway, I hid the gun someplace safe until I can figure out how to properly dispose of it.
Guns are a major problem, especially in the hands of someone like...
It was in a box with Chris's adoption papers... Oh.
Now here to sing the Heart classic Alone is Chris Griffin.
Because it's preventing me from doing my work here at Family Guy.
All right, let's all take turns looking down the barrel with one eyeball and see if we can figure out what's going on.
This gun is not staying in this house for one more second.
Like when Peter was the only one not wearing black jeans at a Rush concert.
And don't let him escape to the completely unoccupied ladies' room.
Ah! No. Please, uncles who voted for Gary Johnson, leave me alone.
He flew on my shoulder while I was having a lemonade.
I never should have accepted it in the first place.
Damn it, Daddy, why won't you just take the gun?
Oh, no. It's floating up, signifying his spirit leaving his body.
Hey, quick question: any of you guys know how to countersue somebody?
So if you want to beat him in Mario Kart, this is your chance.
We're gonna bring him home with us and take care of him until he's 100%.
I want Grandpa to get better, too, but living with us?
All right, Daddy living here is gonna be a big adjustment, and we're all gonna have to make sacrifices.
So, Meg, Daddy will sleep in your room, and Stewie and Chris, you'll stay where you are.
Come on, Meg, it won't be any worse than when I took
All right, Carter, now we're gonna try and jog your memory and get you talking with some familiar pictures.
So, I will hold them up and you say what they are.
Anyone who doesn't know who he is brings shame on his children and wife.
Peter, come on. We're trying to help Daddy, not relive our embarrassing loss to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.
Go on, Lois, scream at him that he should know.
That means we need to put a fifth head on Mount Rushmore.
Hey, Ansel Elgort and Gemma Arterton are in a Cary Fukunaga film.
All right, Daddy, I know NCIS is on, but I want to watch Real Housewives, unless you tell me not to.
These two have a three-year-old feud based on an offhanded remark at a charity fashion show.
I'm sure Andy Cohen will explain it all on Watch What Happens Live after the show.
We don't need another show explaining what we just saw.
So, the president pulls the plug on an investigation into the president?
And maybe worst of all, you engage in constant, gratuitous animal testing.
Sir, as you requested, we had all the monkeys watch Vikings.
Now have them watch Sarah Jessica Parker and Thomas Haden Church in Divorce.
Kids in the Hall sketches that basically had no endings.
And you still took care of me when I was hurt?
But from now on, I'm going to be a better father and grandfather.
I haven't been this happy since I went on Safari.
Oh, my God. This is so much faster than Firefox.
It's been wonderful spending so much quality time with you.
Yeah, Carter. You know, you've always been a real bastard, but I got to say, it's nice to see you turning things around.
Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize that I wasted my whole life caring about money, and I'm not giving up another second.
That's why I've decided to retire from Pewterschmidt Industries and give all my money to charity.
Thanks. You know, I was a little worried you guys would be mad about losing your inheritance.
I've seen what wealth's done to you, and I certainly don't want that to happen to us.
I said, Why do you want beef and broccoli now?
Look, I know you're upset about losing our inheritance, but when we got married, the first thing I told you is I didn't want Daddy's money.
Well, yeah, not now, but I didn't know you meant forever.
For the first time in my life, I have a father who's kind and wants to spend time with me.
It's the only way I can afford that surgery to turn myself into 100% stained glass.
Carter's only giving away his money 'cause he's nice now.
So to get our inheritance, we have to figure out a way to make him mean again.
My flapjacks was supposed to have a Superman S on them.
Are you mad? I... I can't tell if you're mad.
At's the point of having millions of dollars if everything can't be Superman?
Why don't we hire a prostitute to bring him almost to completion?
Okay, don't love that my daughter came out of the gates with that.
Why don't we just mix up all the colors of his Play-Doh?
Well, you know what gets Gargamel all riled up is those pesky Smurfs. Maybe there's something there.
Why don't we hire a transvestite to pick him up at a bar, then take off her wig at the exact moment of completion?
Yeah. And now I've got something for you to read, genius.
Hey, wait, I got something. How do we summon Zuul?
Why don't we take him to a truck stop bathroom, and then after completion, we...
Okay, Meg, are you trying to get a rise out of me?
Well, at least I'm saying real ideas and not just repeating things
I have one last idea how to make Carter mean.
You know, this may be crazy, but I'd love to finally play piano for you.
That's pretty dumb. I mean, if I was in a band,
Sounds great. Who's the guy who married a kid and then later on killed his wife?
Meg and Chris, you twist his nipples in opposite directions.
Peter, you may want to take a look at this.
This is just what she's been saying she wanted: to spend time with her dad and for him to love her.
You were right. You having a dad is way more important.
Who told Carter he could give away our (BLEEP) money?
I can't waste time with you. I'm a cutthroat businessman.
Well, I guess it was nice to have time with Daddy while I could.
And Peter, I'm glad you filly realized family is more important than money.
And I think we all learned a valuable lesson about firearms.
That's right, Peter. Guns create problems, but they solve them, too.
You said it, Lois. And you know who else has a gun?
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, thanks for coming in to see me today.
The point is, Chris's grades aren't improving, and just yesterday, he caused a little ruckus in his history class.
We here feel that the best solution is for Chris to attend something called vocational school.
No, vocational school is where less academically capable students learn a trade.
Don't you have to be Italian to go to one of those schools?
Uhp, there will be plenty of those jokes later in the episode.
Now, won't vocational school limit Chris's options down the road?
He'll have a wide range of career options, such as the following:
Do you think you could take Stewie to a birthday party today?
The birthday boy was premature, so he looks like a 12-inch-tall Rachel Dratch.
I can't take another party with that trio of judgy sitcom moms.
Gosh, I just love how you always look so comfortable.
I can't believe I have to go to vocational school.
You know, I'm always at a loss for words in these moments.
Um, your show went off the air and you died 30 years ago, so that phrase means very little to me.
I know it's a big step, honey, but you can do it.
That's right, Chris. This family's never shied away from a new challenge, like when I was the spokesman for that perfume, Deschanel Number Five.
The fragrance for when you want to smell like a 40-year-old toddler.
Yes, I'm here for my first day of vocational school.
This notepad and pencil is from Mr. Tony over there.
Look at that, your first day, and you got all A's.
It true, if you're Jewish, they cut your dong off with an ax?
Okay, everybody dirty up your hands, we'll eat in ten.
Wow. This is way better than that barber school I went to where I couldn't stop pumping the chair.
Just a bit off the top and shorter on the sides.
I am not letting you out of my sight again.
Coming this fall, from the makers of Paranormal Activity comes Normal Activity.
Meg Griffin, you saved your brother's life, so here's your showcase of prizes.
You'll be the talk of the town with your new macaroni necklace.
That's right, you'll be strutting down Spooner Street in this dental floss macaroni necklace made with Oral-B dental floss and Pasta Barilla.
Pasta Barilla: a taste of Italy right in your home.
His hat's flying off cause he's been given a what for.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size, like William Howard Taft?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go retrieve my hat.
You know you're not supposed to be on the furniture.
Look at her. She just sits there and takes it.
And you know what? I'm going to give it to her.
I don't know, but it's going to be a challenge, like trying to seem sad while you're wearing flip-flops.
The owner of a Geo Tracker with the license plate FLP FLP, you're blocking the funeral procession.
A big part of being a mechanic is being completely shocked when somebody hasn't had a particular item
Everyone who's not currently in the room, get over here.
Whoa, whoa, what? You never had a bread sandwich from Pete's?
What do you think it is? It's three pieces of bread.
Me, I like a piece of sourdough on top, piece of sourdough on bottom, and a nice piece of wheat in the middle.
That way, she'll be the most popular girl in school.
Mr. and Mrs. G, thanks so much for having us over for dinner.
Chris, tell your mom and dad about the story you wrote.
Okay. It's called The Black Duck. The Black Duck. You ever seen a black duck?
I seen a brown duck, a yellow duck, a white duck with a green head.
Hey, there's all kinds of ducks. This kid thinks of a black one.
Hey! If it was such a stupid story, why would it have such a well-rounded protagonist?
Oh, Chris, I'm so happy you have so many wonderful new friends.
He takes care of a lot of stuff for us. Stuff?
All right, if we can't make Meg popular, we can at least find her a boyfriend.
Neil, can you come out? We need to talk to you.
Also, can you pick up the phone and order me a pizza?
That can wait. I've just looked at some porn, and I need you guys to give me some assisted relief.
I can't believe we did all that and he still turned us down.
Yes, there's literally no one in town sad and desperate enough to date my sister.
Hey, guys, can you hold my phone and point it over this way?
It's an inability to look out and see someone who needs someone.
Yeah, I'm not a pro. You get what you get.
Anyway, what is wrong with people that they're so myopic and just preoccupied with their own little lives?
It's whatever it was when you handed it to me.
The point is, there's someone out there for everyone if they're just willing to open their eyes and look.
Kevin, before you go through with this, would you consider taking Meg out for a date?
Look, we know you've had a hard road ever since you came home from Iraq.
Well, this could be a chance for you to help someone else who maybe feels as bad inside as you do.
Now, don't let on that we had anything to do with Kevin asking her out.
Yeah, he asked me out. Totally out of the blue.
Principal Shepherd, we came to ask if there's anything we can do to get Chris back in the school.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I-I'm afraid we can't do that.
I think you can do that and a whole lot more.
That is not what a testicle is supposed to look like.
Stewie, I still don't understand why we have to pretend to work at the restaurant.
That's why I gave the rest of the staff the night off.
We have to be in total control of the evening.
Uh, Stewie, before you gave the staff the night off, did you check the reservation book?
Just keep giving them crayons until we figure it out.
Chris, there's something your father and I want to talk to you about.
Can you stop lifting your rusty weights while we talk to you?
Chris, you need to be back in high school where you belong.
But Principal Shepherd won't let you back in, and we don't know what to do.
What do I need school for? Tony Danza never went to school, and he played a guy named Tony on four different TV shows.
Chris, I'm gonna say this in a way an Italian mechanic would understand.
The Hollender rehearsal dinner review on Yelp. Undercooked and underwhelmed.
So, Meg, how was your night out with your boyfriend?
Well, I guess some people are just meant to be alone, you know?
Yeah, it actually felt great to be empowered for once.
You know what, Brian, we actually did make Meg's life a little bit better.
Well, you know what the real lesson is here, Stewie.
I'm sure they can fix it in editing. What I was saying...
So, Chris, how was your first day back at school?
It was fine. I'll miss the guys at vocational school, but it is nice to be back where I belong.
It's not. God, how could you guys not know about this?
Peter. Peter, I need you to hold my ears. Aah!
The Yule Log Channel just put on another log, and I really like it when the wood goes crack, crack, pop, crack, pop.
I guess I'll just drive there by myself... in my Jeep!
Let's go do TV commercial driving meant for a professional driver on a closed course.
For the driver who doesn't like to stop going just because they've run out of road.
Potholes and bumps and ruts can come as they will.
Plus, it's a good excuse to put on my winter coat and find items from last year still in the pocket.
Ooh, sticky pennies, a rock-hard Starburst, an appointment card for my next dental appointment that's already come and gone, a ticket stub for a matinee of Interstellar, an unwrapped piece of Dentyne, a yarmulke from when that Jewish guy died, a breath mint from the now-defunct Clorets corporation, printed-out Mapquest directions to Dave & Buster's,
Flintstone vitamin I didn't take 'cause it was Barney, refrigerator magnet from local electrician who is now arrested, and balled up tissues with last year's flu on it.
Meg, it is my duty as a bad father to prove that I can do anything my kids can do.
All right, I think I'm getting the hang of it.
Yeah, does anybody else in the family have any secret talents we don't know about?
But he did continue edging, bringing himself to the verge of sexual pleasure, only to stop at the last moment.
I'm Ron Howard, and I do voice-overs for this show now, too.
But her voice-overs were not reasonably priced, so they turned to me, a guy who sounds like Morgan Freeman, but is not, in fact, Morgan Freeman.
My name is Josh Robert Thompson, and I perform for scale.
Let's celebrate by burning our lips on vending machine hot chocolate.
Mine has whipped cream, so I didn't get it on the first sip.
Um, I-I'm not really good at public speaking, so I'll just say... farble shlup muckle blop.
You may also know me as the lady who threw a plate of cheese during that city council meeting.
I just wanted to say how proud we are of Meg's accomplishment.
So it looks like the Griffins are going to the Winter Olympics in Korea!
Do you think there'll be a gag about the Jamaican bobsled team?
My race isn't for a few days, so we should have plenty of time to hang out.
I'm trying to land you some endorsements, and I have a lead with a very popular IBS medication.
Quick, say, I never let traveler's diarrhea keep me grounded.
Well, then you're just handing this thing right to John Kruk!
I heard they always have to be within quipping distance of each other.
She looks like a baby, and she's best friends with a gay guy.
Hi. I just had to come over and introduce myself.
My name is Stewie, and I'm a huge fan of you guys.
And can I just say, the shape of your head is stunning.
Okay, I don't know what that is, but they're just jealous.
Well, I have to say, you two are the best thing to happen to sports since the New York Knicks finally changed their name.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your 2018 New York Pieces-Of-Dog-.
Now, refresh my memory: is Tara the one who had the DUI?
Oh, sounds like something Gandalf says at the foot of a mountain.
I was thinking maybe we could grab dinner or something.
I was supposed to help the speed skaters get their tights over their thighs.
No, I just like wearing clothes that feel like pajamas.
And this voice-over was actually covered by my original payment.
Yeah, well, there's a lot you don't know about me.
I'm just gonna run to the bathroom real quick. B-R-B.
That's just something I do to get the skater chicks.
Wait, but she had a great time with me tonight.
You're just a train conductor... who has a huge kicking foot?
That's it. Like your missiles, I'm about to go ballistic.
That's it. Like your missiles, I'm about to go ballistic.
Huh, he's usually up by now dry-heaving in the shower.
Hi, I'm pink-eyed Bob Costas, live from our Pyeongchang studios, here to bring you breaking news, and occasionally blink off-synch in an attempt to satisfy my searing eye itchiness.
A U.S. tourist, Peter Griffin, has been apprehended by North Korea and is being held prisoner for what I'm being told is trespassing and doing that thing with your eyes that makes you look Chinese.
Damn it. Why does Peter have to ruin every family vacation?
Just like he ruined our trip to La La Land.
I got to go wash Tara's lipstick off my ass.
Well, at least I have a side, you neutral Swiss cowards!
I really thought I had a shot with Tara Lipinski, and he ruined it.
Of course. I owe you for getting me that job with Gloria Allred.
They say if you get a job doing what you love, you never work a day in your life.
Now you're gonna beat me up like a Batman fight, only with gay words.
I don't care. Where was he when I needed help?
Down here, it's my time. It's my time down here!
And once I get 'em on the run, I'm gonna keep 'em on the run.
The only thing you care about is nugs, chilling and grindage.
Wait, before you kill me, can you at least give me an extra bullet so I can pretend to catch one in my teeth?
Don't worry, Meg, it's less sad because they don't bleed.
Oh, don't shoot this guy. He was nice to me.
It's my turn next try. I want to go next.
You think one guy had to shovel this whole walkway?
Well, I realized that it wasn't worth doing if you guys weren't there with me.
Oh, Meg, we are so sorry for how we treated you this week.
You may not have won a gold medal in the games, but you won one in our hearts.
I don't know, I'm thinking maybe we can hang out a little bit longer, see what else Korea has to offer... Uh-oh.
Peter landed somewhere in the DMZ, and was recaptured by North Korea.
Fortunately, tensions caused by this international incident were resolved by the steady hand of Dennis Rodman, who let Kim Jong-un win in a one-on-one basketball game against him, continuously saying, Oop, you got me, in a way that was just convincing enough for Kim to believe.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable talking about it down at the station.
The police station: come for the racial profiling, stay for the comfort.
Oh. Yeah. A friend invited me to this charity ball.
The Friends of Distinction are out there, grazing in the grass.
Grazing in the grass is a gas, baby, can you dig it?
And everything here is so real, you can feel it
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it
They can dig it, you can dig it, oh, let's dig it
Mmm, that was a good toilet dream about my neighbor and his lawn.
Look, I'm all for Chris mowing the lawn, but you got to teach him.
After my weekend job as a zookeeper with very muscular thighs. Thigh there, nice to see you all.
And I am sure you're all wondering how much I can squat.
For that answer, you'll have to go to my Instagram,
Now, I'd like to open up the floor for questions.
Now, who wants to see me jump over this fence from a standing start?
Okay, Chris, now, if you're gonna learn how to mow a lawn, the first lesson is that you always start by 7:00 a.m., before everyone wakes up, including roosters.
Now, to start the mower, you grab this pull cord like so and give it a nice hard yank.
For the rest, you can just watch this how-to video on YouTube.
What's going on, guys? I'm Corey, here to take your lawn mowing skills to the next lev.
He disappeared, and now there's this guy doing ISIS videos and they think it's Corey.
This is Corey, here to talk about making a dirty bomb with stuff you can find in your kitchen.
You know, I've been looking for a muscley-armed young fella to mow my lawn.
Sorry, Mr. Herbert, but I don't even want to mow this lawn.
You could bring your friend over there to help you.
Oh, Admiral, you've been so good to me these past weeks, with my husband gone and me alone to tend to his massive estate.
You know, helping you might have been difficult were you not so utterly charming.
Plus, helping you helps me forget my own country's troubles and my struggle to save our national flower, the Masdevallia orchid.
I've devoted my life to raising money to save it.
The secret, however, is to October in Zurich but in September, to avoid the obnoxious Octobering crowds, saving October for Paris... Novembering there...
Then Decembering in Palm Beach in November and, in December, Januarying, of course, as always, in Gstaad.
Well, he may be an admiral, but he's certainly not admirable.
So, Admiral, you must have had quite the military career.
It means a lot from a man whose top hat looks suspiciously like an Amazon Echo with a cardboard brim.
Look, all right, there's no reason to sabotage each other.
There's plenty of Newport heiresses for the both of us.
Uh, I don't know if you've noticed, but the sun's been up for, like, an hour.
No, no, no, no, you don't have to get up.
I'm sure she doesn't fantasize about your contractor, who's already downstairs working on...
Well, I can't really figure out what he's working on.
The only catch is her 95-year-old husband is still hanging on by a thread.
I can't make a move until he dies, which, hopefully, is any day now.
If we can charm her, we'll be set for life.
I think this is the day I starve to death.
That's too much work. Just mow with the blower always pointed toward Joe's lawn.
Hey, boys. I've got some cookies and special grape juice for you.
But, Mr. Herbert, you always made the cookies with the large pill in the center for me.
We just got to wait for our chance to move in.
Is that a Cats Protective League pin on your lapel?
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but my husband is feeling ill and stepped into the men's locker room.
Would you be so kind as to check on him?
Well, I'm not sure if we'll be able to find him.
Don't worry. I've got a very thick, yellow toenail finder app on my phone.
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
I didn't, I didn't hear you 'cause of the prosthetics.
Hey, just checking to see if the old man is dead.
I've got no chance, have I? A tertiary character like me.
You most certainly do not. I don't even think we're going to give you the dance you rehearsed.
You think you know how to bang a woman who's seen a dodo bird?
Well, you've clearly invested a lot of time into this.
And yet two fellows like us with loose lips could cause it all to fall apart.
I'm the guy who enjoyed like hell shopping for this little ruse.
Look, there's plenty of money to go around, and I don't know how much more of this I can take, so I'll make a deal with you guys.
If you can help me wrap this up, if you know what I mean... Take her skydiving, something that might, you know, overwhelm her elderly heart...
But unless you're prepared to kill her, get the hell out.
It's time you do all the work and I goof off with Mr. Herbert.
Well, he often said he wanted to explode all over me.
Hey, did you get a little aroused when we were wrestling?
Was found dead in her home of an apparent heart attack.
Listen, I-I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I-I promise, it won't happen again.
Well, a deal's a deal, so here's your share of the estate.
Gentlemen, due to a disastrous investment in a Mindy Project amusement park,
Miss Woolworth etcetera, etcetera, died owing $18 million, for which you are now liable.
Webster's defines class as a group of students gathered at a pre-ordained time for the purposes of education.
Who could turn the world on with her smile? Angela.
Who could take a nothing day and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? Angela.
So no one told you life was gonna be this way.
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.
But at least Angela died doing what she loved: swimming less than 20 minutes after she had eaten.
Honest, about herself just as much as she was about the world around her.
She had grace, courage, and an unmatched zest for life.
She may be gone, but her voice will live on in DVD and Hulu Plus and tiny droid-projected messages.
I may have lost a boss, but heaven has gained a princess.
Oh, we're getting a new boss? Oh, I hope it's Hugo Boss.
Tonight's episode of Family Guy is brought to you by Hugo Boss.
Look for us in the low-trafficked corner of Macy's between Eddie Bauer and the never-bought male jewelry.
My name is Bert and this is my lovely wife Sheila.
Now that Angela's no longer with us, we will be your new bosses.
We're splitting the job because one of the shareholders' favorite songs was Ebony and Ivory, so here we are.
Now we know it's difficult to remember two new names, so to make things easier,
Boy, I bet you she's a handful in the bedroom.
Damn it, I went all the way around the room!
Now, some of you may find the idea of two bosses unconventional, but...
And our door will always be open to you any time of day.
And there is no issue too big or too small.
So, as our mascot Pawtucket Pat says, All ye Federalists, imbibe!
Well, at least it beats being home with my wife.
All right, Sheila, let's do it right here on the desk while Bert watches.
Sorry, I-I thought I was picking up on a vibe.
So, Peter, we've been tasked with making the operations around here run more efficiently, and part of that will involve reassigning people based on their abilities.
So we're gonna put a flag on you, and wherever you go, people will know that's where they put their recyclables.
Well, at least make sure all the liquids are gone, please, before you throw them.
We now return to Titanic 2, narrated by Al Gore.
But due to man's excessive use of fossil fuels, climate change had rendered the iceberg nothing more than a small cube.
Eh, it's part of my job now 'cause of my new bosses.
Their names are Bert and Sheila. My job sucks now.
Sir, this is a neighborhood where we respect the rules of society.
I'm gonna take a picture of you and post it on Facebook.
Oh, great! I hope it gets a lot of likes.
Which I am, at this moment, describing to my family in my living room.
Well, how do you know I wasn't telling my wife a story and you're a figment of my imagination?
We'll be right back with more Greg in the Window.
Greg in the Window, brought to you by never-bought male jewelry.
We need you to taste test our new varieties of seasonal beers, which will be coming down this conveyor belt.
Also, our delivery truck drivers have to pass an annual drug test, so we'll need you to collect their urine samples.
They'll be coming down this same conveyor belt in similarly colored cups, which you will need to place on this tray.
You know, our testing came back and shows we're losing market share.
Oh, yes, come on in, honey. We've put our wangs away.
Yeah, our customers find a 300-year-old mascot hard to relate to, they want a regular guy.
You know, a-a guy who'd drink a beer on a toilet.
Playing a game on my phone and having a beer.
Ew, yes, but also, that's exactly the kind of customer we should be appealing to.
I think we found our new mascot. Are you in, Peter?
May I have a moment to talk it over with my mentor?
Hey, now you and Jared from Subway have two things in common.
Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out today's ceremonial first pitch, the face of the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery,
Hey, guys, I'm Billy on the Street, and I'm here with one of the biggest mascots
Okay, we're gonna go up to people and give a dollar to everyone who recognizes you. Let's go.
Sir, sir, sir, for a dollar, do you know who this is?
Oh, you don't own a TV? I'm very impressed! Let's go!
There's, uh, there's more running than I thought there'd be.
He was just getting a cup of coffee with his daughter.
I watch Black Mirror and The Goldbergs, and that's it!
Between you and me, I think he may need a lady friend.
And the other day, I even got to hang out with a bunch of other famous mascots.
So, you, uh, you really make all those cookies in that tree?
You know what, let's just forget the conversation and just pose for the picture.
By the way, Tony, I'm sorry your wife was shot by Donald Trump's children.
Sorry about him. We ruined people's days in New York earlier.
That's right. Your character's so popular, you're gonna have a balloon in the annual Quahog Parade!
You have a dog that makes jokes and drinks beer?
Well, think about it, Peter. The public loves Pawtucket Pat.
Imagine how much they'd love to know he has a funny sidekick dog who drinks with him.
Wow, that could be really cool. What do you say, Brian?
It's our pleasure to introduce Pawtucket Pat and his new sidekick Hops McElaney, the Alcoholic Dog. Come on, y'all!
What were you doing up on the roof last night?
Pat. I was up on the roof because you told me drinks were on the house.
Hey, at least you're not getting attacked by a goose for no reason.
Hey, you got bread, bro? Give me that bread, bro.
Guys, from now on, I need to stand this up in the middle of your table.
Man, I hate being a sidekick to this stupid dog.
I doubt any of you can begin to know what it's like to ride someone's coattails, to play second fiddle to some fat idiot, to constantly be setting up someone else's...
I tell you, this sucks worse than being a monkey at Coachella.
Uh, no, I don't think that'd be a good idea.
Hey, guys, so you know how water tastes like nothing?
Well, what if it tasted like every bottle had a nickel in it?
And I want to hawk a loogie in your face.
And I want to hawk a loogie in your face.
Okay, fine, but do me a favor: don't spit on my friend.
Coming up, uncomfortable pause as anchor throws to reporter in the field.
But first, hey, hungover dads, want to go to a parade?
Not just being worried about your kids, but everyone else's kids around you, too?
Tom, I'm standing here outside some public toilets where dads who are really hurting will be vomiting in front of their still-developing children.
The parade is tomorrow, but already the giant balloons are being inflated including two newcomers this year:
Pepe, the alt-right frog, and Hops the Dog, the beloved beer pitchman.
In fact, Hops is so popular that hundreds of Quahog women have volunteered to blow up his balloon.
And here comes the marching band, led by baton twirler Jane Duncan, whose aunt is famously-thin actress Bebe Neuwirth.
Jane lists her hobbies as baton twirling and trying to contact her aunt.
And, look, is that the beer mascot you've all been waiting for?
Well, Sarah, another turning point, a fork stuck in the road.
You know, part of me is glad Sarah met Henry, because she and I had a pact that if neither of us was married by 40, we'd get hitched.
And I think you all know how that would have gone.
Tom, I'm standing here along the parade route where the Hops balloon has just been punctured, and is now raining helium
Hey, Peter, sorry all that fame went to my head.
Greg Mitchell, sometimes I feel like I married you and that window.
The two of you are more similar than you think.
You plug in your address, and it gives you an estimate of what your house is worth.
But they call it a Zestimate, because of the Z in Zillow.
Wow, my house is way up from when I bought it.
It says... it says my house is a murder house.
Yeah, it says... it says, in the '60s, some woman named Doris Billingsly died in my house.
You know, they say when someone dies violently like that,
Ea I'm saying you might have a g-g-g-g-g... disembodied spirit in your house!
Not much. I wanted to know if you're gonna go to the dance on Friday.
I was thinking maybe you and I could go together.
Uh, Chris, that very attractive girl just asked you out, and you said no.
Well, sorry, Brian, she just doesn't do it for me.
That's what the press would have you believe, but he's not.
Okay, guys, now, the murder took place down here in the basement, so it's probably our best shot at finding something.
The only spirits I'm used to chasing are whiskey and tequila.
I don't know why you guys listen to a word he says.
Are there any spirits present that would like to communicate with us?
I got scared and tried to run through the wall, leaving a hole shaped like me.
All right, fellas, I just finished up an EVP session.
Oftentimes, the human ear can't pick up paranormal sounds, but electronic recording devices can.
Is this whole thing just you beefing into the microphone?
Stewie, I'm telling you, there's no way Chris is gay.
Actually, Brian and I are taking a survey, and we wanted to see if you had a few minutes.
What year did Bette Midler release You've Got to Have Friends?
Well, then why didn't you go out with that girl?
I have everything I need in that department on my computer.
Sometimes I pretend I'm at the security desk at the mall and everyone at the mall is banging each other.
You're so desensitized by all this porn, you're-you're not even interested in actual girls.
I'm taking this, and we are gonna help you start thinking about sex like a normal teenager.
I had a hell of a time getting off sugar.
Okay, guys, now, I thought we could try to find the ghost by doing the movie Flatliners.
Oh, my God. All right, we are stopping everything right now and watching Flatliners.
You know what, Peter, I think I've had enough ghost hunting.
We've been down here for hours, and we haven't found a thing.
Well, maybe that's because you guys don't know the first thing about catching ghosts.
Time to become an issue at Hooters after 9:00 p.m.
But, uh, as for the white hair, I'm afraid it's permanent.
What do I do now? I mean, should I dye it back?
Wow, Peter, they all think you're a doctor because of your white hair.
I have to say, it does make you look more distinguished.
Well, maybe this will be a good thing after all.
All right, Chris, it's gonna take a few steps to get you off hard-core porn.
Now, the first step is soft-core porn, where nothing really happens.
Oh, wow, she is just riding that guy's belly button.
Well, what was playing the other 200 hours per week?
Using the bathroom. Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop 'em from dunking in the water?
Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop them from dunking in the water?
I fix my car in slow motion in an ad for a supplemental blood thinner.
I took Zanbrex for over 15 years, till I learned the benefits of once-daily Sanguelto, a latest-generation blood thinner.
When I'm at a multiracial picnic for some reason, the last thing I want to do is have a stroke.
I can eat potato salad with chuckling strangers with the confidence of someone who knows he's 12% less likely to suffer a stroke recurrence.
Thanks to Sanguelto, I can snuggle with my age-appropriate wife on a blanket underneath non-holiday-related fireworks.
I left her for six weeks back in 2009, only to realize I was already too old to bed the type of women that would make such a separation worth it.
So, here we are, grinding it out till onef us has that second stroke that you don't come back from.
Well, a lot of kids' first foray into sex is looking at someone else's porn stash.
So, here's a stack of water-stained Playboys that I found in a locker at the town pool bathroom.
Wait. I'm clicking on this thumbnail, but the video isn't opening.
See, you look at them, and then your brain sort of creates a scene for you.
I don't know. I think maybe we should try something else.
I think we should all go investigate the still-unsolved murder of Doris Billingsly, who never did anything but overcook one dinner in March of 1962.
Another sign from the universe that I'll never find love.
Hey, come on, pal. There's plenty of fish in the sea.
Say, you've got a way about you, a certain... trustworthy quality.
You know, we've got an opening at the station for a senior analyst.
I think your white hair would be perfect for it.
You just act like everyone else is an idiot and shout over them.
Terrific. Hey, why don't you come down to the station tomorrow and...?
I haven't been on TV since I had IBS on The Bachelorette.
Excuse me. Uh, do-do you know if I'm gonna get a rose?
Derek, that's why I've decided to give you this rose.
I hate to be a bother, but do you... do you know if I'll be receiving a rose?
I believe something's gonna happen that will put me out of contention for a rose.
Farewell, and thank you for feeding me champagne and shrimp all day.
Switching gears now, I'd like to talk about the crime situation here in Quahog.
So? People want to know that bad stuff's going on out there.
I say, as Americans, we should all take a pledge to kick 'em out.
Peter Griffin, white hair, very credible, thank you so much.
Coming up, lost dog comes home... one piece at a time.
How would you like to do what you just did every night?
No, I'm asking you to join us full-time to be our permanent senior analyst.
Would you excuse me while I step into another room and celebrate like a girl in a Rom-com who just got good news?
If taking Sanguelto, please refrain from dancing like in a Rom-com, as nosebleeds may be permanent.
And remember, most drugs are prescribed to you because a hot girl with a rolling suitcase gave your doctor a free pen.
Who says you can just make things up and call them facts?
You have a responsibility as a member of the press to report the news accurately.
You can't just say crazy things that aren't in any way true.
Well, let me know when you decide on the rules.
When I was young, seeing these half-naked mannequins was all I needed to get me going.
He needs to be able to use his imagination again.
I guess the one without a head is pretty cool.
And that bin of chopped-up ones over there... that could be okay.
We're just trying to get my brother to full mast.
We want to welcome back our new permanent senior analyst,
Has it ever been all the way to the top before, Peter?
So, the new top is even higher than the old top?
And The Middle is a show that was inexplicably on ABC for a very long time.
Peter Griffin, white hair, very credible, thank you so much.
Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when a person has a birthmark on their face.
So, Chris, have you weaned yourself off of Internet porn?
Wait. I thought the whole point was to not wean myself off.
Sure. And for sure this is a real date, and me and the popular kids aren't gonna thrill-kill you tonight.
Which is more than I can say for our pizza.
You're telling lies on the news just to boost your own ego.
It's pronounced Eggo, Lois, and I will thank you to leggo of mine.
Peter, fake news is a real problem in this country right now, and I really don't want my husband contributing to it.
I guess I just like all the attention that came along with having white hair.
Well, I don't think that's the kind of attention you want.
You know what? If it means that much to you,
You want me to be your press secretary in the next episode?
Hey, Dad, I want you to meet my new friend, Meg.
Pleased to meet you, Meg. You have a beautiful rack.
There's no wonder you spend two days a week here.
Okay, Peter, your main job here is to go in rooms before me to make sure there's no static electricity.
And will we be putting our kids in the local public schools?
Dibs on the bedroom in which an intern got murdered.
An intern has been murdered in each of the bedrooms.
Tomorrow, at James Woods High, it's Scoliosis Spine Check Day.
Meg, your father got this great new opportunity, and we need to support him.
Before long, we'll fit right in here, like a cowboy in a Chinese Starbucks.
I've never been to a fancy White House party before.
And we're glad you brought your two children and former Governor Chris Christie.
That's, like, the fourth person who's called Meg Chris Christie.
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry everyone thinks you're a historically unpopular fatso from New Jersey.
And I hope you saved your appetite, because, later, we're all wiping our ass with the Constitution.
Folks, to drink this evening, we've got red wine, white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.
So, what kinds of things do you hearing from our Mr. USA President?
I don't know, fellow American, but here's my Gmail log-in and password,
I have very aching gut from eating so much apple cake.
Tell those kids, if they ever want to see their parents again, they'll make the shoes!
My husband is the son of a felon who went to prison for blackmailing his brother-in-law by entrapping him with a prostitute and then mailing a copy of the tape to his own sister!
Sometimes I wish I could meet someone else whose dad is a fat idiot who once had a hit television show and who, over time, has worn out his welcome.
Meg, I think you'd look amazing in my brand of lifestyle products that are designed to represent a poor person's idea of what a rich person would wear.
When I'm done with you, you'll be pretty enough to marry an Orthodox Jewish son of a felon who's too stupid to get into Harvard the normal way.
And whose voice is way higher than you thought it would be?
With Geico, you can save up to 15% on car insurance.
Wow! Two-thirds of the people here are talking about me.
Hey, Dad, I want you to meet my new friend, Meg.
Thanks again for getting me plastic surgery in my teens.
Um, yeah, anyway, it's an honor to meet you, Mr. President.
Yesterday, I was at Quahog Pond, pulling out carps just to watch them suffocate.
And now look at me, with the winner of the 46th-largest electoral college victory of all time.
And, I got to say, I'm a huge fan of your board game and your beef products and your fraudulent university and...
I cannot wait to once again place my hand onto your Gates of Venus.
My darling Bess, tonight, I'm going to drop the Big One onto your Pacific theater.
Good afternoon, I'm Tim Tucker, not my twin brother, Tom.
You want me to just throw away in one day what I've spent a whole day trying to build?
A whole day's worth of work, poof, gone in a day!
Meg, you expect us to believe that the president of the United States would grab a woman by her (BLEEP)?
Oh, hang on. CNN's on, where I'm the loudest guy on an overcrowded panel.
What we need is to take care of our children.
You think giving them amnesty is fair to the people who are already here?
Well, nothing's ever gonna change if Congress isn't willing to compromise.
I wake up with an erection, but never when she's in the bed with me!
I spent three grand on a Sandals vacation, thinking that might do it!
What? You're still gonna work for that man after he assaulted me?
Just like closed captioning stenographers hated the Sleepy Hollow guy for some reason.
Many people are saying it was the best press briefing in all of history.
Oh. Well, if this lumpy orange garbage vegetable is here, then where's President Donald Trump?
That show... and-and I mean no disrespect when I say this...
But that show looks like it was animated in a moving car.
What would your third wife, the soft-core girl-on-girl porn lady, think about this?
Or the actual porn star your lawyer paid hush money to?
When you walked through that door, you insulted Bob's Burgers and the hundreds of people who work there.
'cause it wins all the Emmys and the kids love it.
Anyway, my point is, if Peter Griffin gets to be a jerk all the time, then why can't Donald Trump?
And you know what else? My days of being mean and insulting are over!
I'm Grover Cleveland, the only president to be married in the White House.
It's a great story. I married a girl who I'd raised since the time she was 11 years old.
We now return to Pirates of the Caribbean, where the sound guy put the microphone too close to Johnny Depp's jangling bracelets.
This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
I've spent $65 million on vacation homes and daytime wine.
We are done being mean and insulting, like Donald Trump is. From now on, this family's gonna be nice and supportive.
Oh. So if we're being nice now, maybe you have nice things to say to me, Dad.
But so what? I'm just a guy from Rhode Island.
Many children have learned their favorite Jewish, black and gay jokes by watching your show over the years.
In fairness, we've been trying to phase out the gay stuff.
Argh... You really do find a way to screw everything up.
If I screwed up so bad, how come I'm a billionaire?
And most of that is borrowed or tied up and underwater.
Kill him in front of me, and I sex you.
I haven't had the chance to ask the president if he is fighting with Peter Griffin.
Why are we so damn divided, America? ...making Neil Armstrong the first man to walk on the Moon.
Who knows, maybe someone listening to this might be the first chicken to walk on the Moon.
I was just kayakin' past, and it looked like you guys could use some help.
He touched my daughter, but I punched him, like, a hundred times, so we're fine now.
Well, then, I'll just go do some awesome Canada stuff.
And just in time to see my appearance on Jeopardy!
I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna miss Washington, D.C.
Well, we had a lot of fun this week and changed zero minds.
If you want to learn more about our president, consult the steele dossier, which is all about getting peed on.
He also, with whole heart and full throat, endorsed a pedophile for the United States Senate.
That didn't fit into tonight's narrative, but should not be forgotten.
Coming up, we interview a man who went a whole Hawaiian vacation without giving a hang loose sign in a picture, and also didn't do the lei joke.
We bought you a cake with the groceries, so it got smashed with a jug of Tide in the car.
You got one from Rami Malek, star of Mr. Robot!
Wow, he gave me the dark circles around his eyes.
I didn't see it at first because it was under some tissue paper.
Yeah. In this one, Gru has been replaced by Harvey Weinstein.
I'll show you a bad guy. Now you touch it.
I don't know, my-my birthday is just... it's kind of a reminder that I'm now one year closer to death, with nothing to show for my time here.
Can I get a Minion cake for my next birthday?
Someday I'll be gone, and it'll be like I was never here at all.
I just want my story to live on, even after I'm gone.
You know, I always did want to write my autobiography.
You know what? Maybe I can lend a hand, Brian.
Hey, Cleveland, you know I love you, but those jeans, they ain't for you.
I knew it. I think I just needed to hear it.
And, uh, to your left, you'll see a joke about Allison Janney being very, very tall.
Uh, she has an Oscar, and we have a great deal of respect for her.
Boy, they are doing a lot with mayo these days.
But deep down, I was disappointed that we took a shot at Allison Janney, just because she can dunk a basketball.
I mean, she has an Oscar, and we have a great deal of respect for her.
All right, Brian, time to get to work on your biography.
It's not uncommon for an author to dedicate his book to his hero, who you have listed as...
Hey, could one of you spot me the greens fees?
Sheesh, you're sure spending a lot of money at that place.
I think they see the Chinese vet down the street.
Well, that's all the information I need to make a binding vocational choice.
You know, I was once in the Blue Man Group.
Hey, Stewie, which title do you like for the biography,
Oh, about that, I was meaning to tell you, your biography is finished.
So enjoy your new robot, and enjoy a bowl of Post Raisin Bran.
This robot is a living record of you and your history.
It knows you and your mannerisms, and it will exist long after you're gone.
He's also got an interchangeable memory bank, an expandable encyclopedia database, and, as a bonus, the new U2 album.
Not just a robot version, Brian, it's like another you, uploaded with your genetic code, your cognitive patterns, and your entire life story. Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke, and now we are stuck in the history past.
That'll go away. He will evolve as he gathers more and more data. Fire hydrants, images. Fire hydrants, news. Fire hydrants, near me.
Oh, he's also been uploaded with your Internet search history. Yahoo Answers: Is Anton Yelchin's jeep for sale?
It's legitimate memorabilia! Applebee's, Brittany, Quahog. Brittany, Applebee's waitress, blonde. Quahog, Applebee's, Brittany, who is. Blonde waitress, Brittany, Quahog, Applebee's. Brittany Babbit, home address.
I don't know that they did. Nobody ever picks me, though.
Just Bruce. And his towel keeps falling off, and he keeps saying, Oops.
She turned 18, so I can say that out loud now.
I need a partner for a project I've been working on.
Oh, great. What line did you use? I have read about this exact case...
Hello, The Girls Aren't the Girls in the Ad Massage.
Oh, yes, the girls are absolutely the girls in the ad.
Cuff them, cop with a wife who's taller than him.
I'm sorry, I'm bad with names, but I'm good at remembering gigantic wives.
Oh, you know, at Applebee's, she's all like, Hi, may I take your order? and at her bedroom window, she's all like, Ah, get out of here.
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want me showing up at your house, don't put a smiley face on my receipt.
Well, as it happens, your robot has a rear panel sensor.
Every time it's triggered, I get a text, like a Google Alert.
Mm-hmm. You know he backs up his hard drive every night, right?
Though I guess you were also backing up his hard drive last night, eh?
Logging in and logging out... wow, there's a lot of computer things that sound dirty.
I know it seems strange, but I'm gonna give it a chance.
And don't worry, we're not gonna be one of those cutesy couples.
Well, much like every other RBs, you are making me sick.
Hey, did you get the license plate of that handsome guy who ran me over last night?
I don't know. Is there anything we need to talk about?
Okay, lay out the pieces, find the cockpit, open the glue, take a sniff  and this will be my life now.
Well, everybody knew that Bob Iger thing, but you got to help me, Joe.
No way. You should've thought of that before you committed a victimless crime between consenting adults in a commercial arrangement which also created jobs and contributed tax dollars to the community.
I'm gonna go watch Bob Iger drain threes at the local gym.
We've got to think of something to make Joe drop the charges.
No, nothing, you just made a weird noise after you took that sip of water.
RB, that's the sound you make when you take a sip of water.
I think I know how to take a sip of water without sounding like a rock concert drum solo.
So the plan is, we trick him into coming in and getting an erotic massage.
Right. And if someone makes a joke about my weight,
I laugh good-naturedly and then go home and eat my feelings.
O-Okay. That-that's part of the plan you keep on the inside.
I don't know. What's the name of this place, anyway? Flip Joke Massage Parlor.
Well, tempted as I may be, there is no way I'm going in there for a massage.
Ma'am, I assume you're giving me a great message, but that's where it stops.
I'll be a monkey's uncle before I accept a sexual favor.
And that's the story of how your mother... my sister... got into college.
You're certainly my smartest nephew, but Harvard is only for humans.
I tell you, Janine, I sure feel dumb for what I said earlier.
Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe, we got pictures of you getting a sexual favor a while back, so now you got to drop the charges.
And now maybe you could drop a few LBs, huh?
Hey, Brian, I think I put in a good day of writing.
They're like the corral, and the words are my wild horses.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
Sir, all I said was your Discover card was declined.
Stewie? What are you doing? What the hell happened to RB?
To show you that the last thing you need is a detailed account
And I needed to show you that no one wants to read your autobiography, not even you.
Because your best is middling, your worst is intolerable, and when you die, the most you'll want written about you is He Was a Good Boy on your tombstone.
We now return to The Talking Talking Dead, the show that talks about the show that talks about The Walking Dead.
Okay, so what do we think about what they thought about stuff?
It was awesome. Oh, my God, it was so great how they thought that other show was so great.
Yeah, totally. And that one part of the show where the guy was talking about that one part of the other show and how he didn't see that coming?
I need an aftershow after this aftershow, just to know what I just saw about what I just saw about what I just saw.
I'm actually starting to get a little worried, you know?
And remember, Brian, he wouldn't do anything you wouldn't do.
I tell you, Lois, being a masseuse is a tough job.
But it all just goes to show that basically every licensed massage therapist in this country is a prostitute.
Oh, yeah. You can pretty much do whatever you want with any masseuse ever, because they're all prostitutes.
If you're ever seeing, like, a physical therapist, or doing yoga with a private instructor?
But Peter, there's, there's one thing I still don't get.
Why did you take the massage job in the first place?
For you, Lois. I did it to earn enough money to buy a comb for your beautiful hair.
I sold my beautiful hair to buy you a bottle of massage oil.
Great. So now I'm an unemployed masseuse with a bald wife.
Don't you do it. Don't you go to the gross side.
In honor of opening day at Fenway Park this weekend, the Red Sox are offering four tickets behind home plate to the person who makes the best Red Sox ad.
I still can't believe you won by filming yourself pooping in a Yankees helmet.
I am not a subtle filmmaker, and my audience wouldn't have it any other way.
Joe, what are you eating your ice cream out of?
They ran out of those mini batting helmets, so they're serving it in athletic cups.
He wasn't behind the counter, but he had a blue shirt on.
I think somebody might be having a little fun with you.
Yeah, come to think of it, he did have a friend filming, and he made me eat the first seven bites in front of him, and he didn't charge me anything.
All right, now to have the only exciting thing in the game happen as soon as I turn my back.
Hey, buddy, that's just a break in the line so people can pass through.
Yeah, it's all the way to that guy with the scorebook just waiting for someone to talk to.
His history will tell you it's not a sustainable pace for an everyday outfielder.
Buddy, if you really gotta go, you can use that one.
Sir, I can assure you there's no such thing as Space Cats.
Now, can you direct me to Earth's reserve of yarn?
Excuse me, ma'am, could you direct me to Earth's reserve of near-empty tuna tins?
Guys! I found the best toilet in the whole place.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a big Boston welcome to Peter Griffin, the fist transgender Red Sox fan.
Peter, you used the transgender bathroom, so now everyone thinks you're transgender.
Cleveland, what are you eating your Cracker Jacks out of?
Oh, the guy said they were out of regular boxes,
It looks like we've got ourselves a good old-fashioned Cracker Jack off.
Good morning, Peter. We saw the game last night, and, well, we just want you to know that we wholeheartedly support all transgender people.
Peter, before you say anything that might clear all this up, let me tell you about our stellar transgender employee benefit package.
Well, as such, you're entitled to supplemental time off, our on-site masseuse and a $60 gift card from Nordstrom Rack.
Well, in the words of trailblazer Caitlyn Jenner, I will do anything for money and attention.
You'd always swallow it before I could see what I did.
And one last look at my crack imprint on the walk of fame.
I would find out later that when you put your ass in wet cement, you're just sealing it shut forever.
Best they could do was poke holes in it so it comes out like Play-Doh spaghetti.
Peter, pretending to be transgender to get time off work trivializes a real struggle in this country.
I don't know what that is, but you got to knock this off.
And direct me to Earth's reserve of sun-dappled window seats.
Besides the fact that you're lying to your employers, you're taking advantage of a civil liberty that so many oppressed people have fought their entire lives for.
Is that the stuff in potato chips that makes your bum go bam?
I can't even begin to describe the density of illness
Look, Peter, the good news is you still fit in your wife's wedding gown.
That's just it, Peter... this whole thing is a joke to you.
Are you forgetting I have a dad who's a woman?
No, of course not. That's the first thing everyone thinks of when they see you.
Oh, I forgot to mention, one of you guys has to be in charge of changing my diaper the whole trip.
Okay, I guess we should, like, draw straws or something.
Actually, I've been observing all of you for the past few hours, and I choose Quagmire.
And I feel like you wouldn't crack if things start to go south.
Well, I'll turn to you, very sincerely, and I'll look you right in your eyes, and I'll say, Quagmire, I've got poopies.
Like Huma Abedin, I'm trying to forget about my Weiner.
I don't get it. How does Rebel Wilson always look so fetching?
You could be, too, if you just let your hair down a little.
Now you just take that beautiful hair down to the salon, and you'll be a ten.
Thanks for helping me at 11:30 on a school day.
Now that I'm living as a woman, I can say whatever I want to men and they can't hit me.
Hey, you shut your mouth! That man is a hero!
Well, it's definitely true that I respect the boundaries of women.
When you get married, you don't think you'll be home together all day.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm the one who planted the evidence that got you suspended.
I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan of your music.
Now, Peter, one of the perks of being a woman is that you get to go out and have a white wine, squeak-fart lunch with your friends.
Yeah, you could tell from the wedding they were not gonna last.
Those machines in the ladies' room don't vend pants, do they?
Don't let 'em take my salad. I'm still working on it.
Come on! I waited an hour and a half for this!
Well, you went into a coma after you were hit in the head by a fan.
And since the company was paying for your medical care anyway, we fulfilled your letter of medical intent for your sex reassignment surgery.
She's saying that your surgery to become a woman was a complete success.
Peter, I'm sorry this happened, but it's your own fault.
That's right, but now that it's done, maybe I can help you with the transition.
You know, I've always been a great supporter of the LGBLT...
Mom, you know, our world today is filled with people like Dad trying to find their identities.
Whether it's cutters, or people who cut themselves, or people who drag knives across their thighs to feel something.
I guess we'll just have to deal with this, like when Chris won that hundred-dollar scratcher and talked down to everybody.
It would take another eight years before I summoned the courage to kiss him at a backyard barbecue, and from that moment on...
Thank you for showing me the 90 things women have to do before going to bed.
Can we do one last judgmental scroll through Facebook first?
Now we just drift off to sleep, thinking about Rick from Midas Muffler.
'cause I had two sips of tea at 3:30 this afternoon.
You can just read on an impossibly bright iPad while I toss and turn in a pissy way.
Hey, now that we're all settled at this table, you guys want to move outside 'cause it's such a nice day?
Okay, why don't you go save us a table outside, and we'll be there soon?
You want me to start a new tab for you?
Your friends left the minute you came out here, and they didn't pay their indoor tab.
I was already at the end of a long journey to find the courage to become a woman.
But before that, I lived for 61 years as a miserable, miserable man.
I grew up in the small town of Football, Texas, and from the age of eight, I was mercilessly teased for being different and dressing funny.
Then, at the age of 14, I had an epiphany.
I'm having a hard time focusing without a drink, but go on.
It took me 47 years from that day to officially own who I am.
In those 47 years, I became an expert at hiding my secret.
I became a war hero and raised a family, but I was dying inside, and the deeper I buried it, the more unhappy I became, and eventually, I even thought of ending my own life.
You know nothing about what it means to feel this struggle.
I kind of stumbled into all this, but you've been dealing with it your whole life.
And my story, to one degree or another, is every transgender person's story, and all those stories are the price of admission to finally feeling at peace with who you are...
I feel really awful, and I'm a really bad person for what I did.
Now, could you direct me to Earth's reserve of other dog butts?
It just took becoming a woman to make you a better man.
I think I might be able to help you with that, Peter.
Dad, you lost a wiener but came out a winner.
But, hey, you have the floor if there's something hilarious you want to say.
Boy, I love it when characters are expressed by props.
I kind of feel like this is less of a crossover and more of a roast.
Great. It's that guy I only have one thing in common with.
Oh, my God, I'm never gonna get up these stairs.
Aw, even Slinky from Accounting can make it up the stairs.
I haven't felt this out of shape since I took surfing lessons.
I'm just gonna give you a little push, and you just stand up.
Okay, so, welcome to the first meeting of our women's creative writing workshop.
Well, I guess it's my turn. Louise lowered her velvet hood, letting loose her flowing red hair. Ignoring her friends' obvious and understandable envy, she confidently approached the mysterious castle. The doors blew open, as if some magical force had been expecting her. Louise belonged here, if only because this is where Horatio called home. Then, through the vegetation, and past the mist that sprinkled her heaving bosom, she saw him. Horatio, with his long, flowing hair blowing in the breeze, his cape fluttering. He had only two loves in his life: his horses and Louise's heaving bosom. He grabbed her tighter than she'd ever been held before. A way in which her husband, Paulter, had not held her since before they were married. Horatio then took Louise by the hand, leading her out to his stables as her bosom heaved. Louise's mind was racing in anticipation of the dirty hay sex that was gonna most definitely happen. As the two lovers entangled into one atop the probably peed-on hay, Louise's bosom heaved. They spent the next 18 minutes fighting off sneezes, in the throes of ecstasy.
I got it. I'll do what James Franco did in 127 Hours.
Yes, I'd like to enroll in a couple of classes so I can have sex with girls not old enough to get into bars.
I just want to go to my desk and surf the Internet.
I can't do it. Here, you're just gonna have to kill me.
Peter, you caused millions of dollars' worth of water damage, all because you couldn't make it up the stairs.
I haven't been this embarrassed since I forgot about the silent part in George Michael's Faith.
I've started using these pills called Stiff for Hours from the gas station.
This is basically a guide to what Lois is looking for in a lover.
Lois is writing a romance novel about a woman who is unhappy with her husband and begins to have a torrid affair with a caped lover who has horses.
All this happened because I'm too fat to make it up some stairs.
I can't do it on my own. I'm too weak.
All right, we'll help you, Peter, but we're doing it Quagsberry rules.
I've taken Quagmire's place as a Union soldier in the Civil War.
I dared them to, and it was a big mistake.
The other guy in my tent is a wet dead guy.
All right, Peter, today we start helping you lose weight.
First, let me just make sure you're not hiding any food in your clothes.
When I turned about 40, it started breaking up into two.
Well, the costs are meager when you're able to dominate and control the beast with just... the slightest glance.
Anyway, I've been speaking to my horse in the silent language of knowing, and I...
You would have to hate horses not to know that.
Do regular gyms have open garage doors where members' large dogs can charge innocent civilians?
Okay, to start, why don't you go meet the owner,
So, to start out, like, uh, tell me, what's your favorite kind of food?
Yeah, no, it's, like, uh... like, probably one of the worst things you can eat.
Yeah, I... yeah, I mean... you said... your-your words, uh... pizza.
It's clear you're an idiot and deserve no more of my time.
Okay, Peter, a good and conspicuous workout is to do lunges on the sidewalk.
Okay, Peter, whatever you do, don't look down the hole.
Okay, okay, whatever you do, do not dip your cupped hand in the water.
The chemicals in the water are not breaking down the integrity of these movements!
Okay, Peter, whatever you do, do not open your eyes underwater.
I thought we were gonna get a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream with all the millennials who can afford ten-dollar scoops of ice cream but can't afford to move out of their parents' house.
We are. But first I need to pick up this wine that Lois mentioned in her story.
Where's that part about the wine? The doors magically opened. Chill came over her. Through the vegetation. Light mist.
Or, who knows, maybe even is having an affair with him.
Do my-do my clothes make it look like I work here?
Looks like we're gonna have to take more drastic measures.
No! You said you would do whatever's necessary to help you lose weight.
I thought it was the pig guys, but, you know what, it was the bread.
I'll tell you what... First guy that lets me out gets his own spin-off.
Yeah, you told us you would do anything to lose weight!
I lied! I just want to be free, like a recently divorced man with no kids!
I mean, do-do you think Lois could be having an affair with this Horatio guy?
I have to go get groceries and won't be back until later tonight.
Oh, my God, Stewie, she's going to the store and won't be back until tonight?
No, but we should follow her and see what the hell is going on.
All right, Peter, now, I know you haven't eaten in a while, so this is something called the Pocket Diet.
Uh, Glenn, can we go somewhere and just talk for a minute?
I thought that you wrote everything you were looking for in a lover, and, if I could embody some of those things, maybe I would have a shot with you.
But then I found out Horatio is real, and-and I couldn't bear to see you do something like this to the family.
Then, thinking I was revealing all my most intimate wants and desires, you thought that you could exploit what you read to seduce me?
But when you thought I might be cheating with someone other than yourself, you found that, and only that, morally objectionable?
And you bring Stewie here, who doesn't understand any of this?!
I volunteered at the special needs living facility, and Horatio happened to like horses.
So, once a week, I take him to the stables.
And the cape is from a Darth Vader costume he had as a kid.
Yes, I have fantasies about him dominating me with his idiot strength.
That's why I wrote it in a story, because I knew that I would never act on it.
Ugh. I never thought a dog could be such a genuine piece of human garbage.
It all just made sense to me at the time.
Joe and Cleveland, are you ready to see your new Peter?
Yes. I might want me a little taste of that.
Be careful what you ask for, 'cause you never know...
I feel a little sheepish to get so fooled by a silly little book that Lois wrote.
Yes, but, you know, I think what we missed in all of this is that Lois wrote a beginning, middle, and end to something.
Well, nothing, but, you know, I think-I think any writer knows how hard it is to be staring at that blank page.
Why don't you get yourself down to the library and open up a book.
Remember, kids, a library card is free, but knowledge is priceless.
I thought it was a rerun. Okay, here we go.
All right, now let's go miss the urinal with half a whiz and get out of here.
My stomach is starting to sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger gasping for air at the end of Total Recall.
My eyes are popping out at the end of this movie!
You remember last night when you called me the lowest-class alcoholic in the world?
Well, I found one rung lower. I'm a party bus guy now.
That's got to be way better than when I drove a Fiat.
Get me 17 shoehorns and some canola oil, and we'll go!
Okay, guys, now this is a bus for a fireman's bachelor party.
So just follow my lead and we'll fit right in.
Now, which one of these scumbag firemen will go after his fiancée?
I'm beginning to think those vodka cranberries may have had alcohol in them.
Hey, how many of you kids are on the horny drugs?
Tonight, we pass around Stifler's mom, and in the morning, it's off to die quick in Vietnam.
It's time to announce this year's prom king and queen.
I dragged this piece of dirty cardboard in from the alley to show y'all how to get down.
Cocked your head to the side and said I'm angry
Oh, these just say if anything should happen to you,
I had a lot of fun with you tonight, Courtney.
Sometimes I just blurt that out when I get excited.
Here. Rub this up and down on the inside of your cheek.
I guess this means I have a phone call to make.
Would you tell Andrew that he is not the father?
I mean, like, there was palm trees like it was Hawaii, but then there was a suit of armor in the corner.
Can we get back to the fact that you're my dad?
I was hoping that you could tell me about her.
Your mom... your mom... was really... thing hanging on the bulletin board behind you.
Oh, gosh, she was, she was just so... word on the bottom of your coffee cup.
I just have some great memories of her... numbers to call in case of emergency or accidental poisoning.
So you don't know your mom? Who do you live with?
Well, right now I'm on a futon in the rafters of my friend's garage.
Anyway, thank you so much for being so nice, and let's talk soon?
Wait, hold on. You can't live in a ferret garage.
I have an extra bedroom, and the bed has a bunch of different-sized pillows on it.
Hmm. I do love dealing with those pillows every day, but are you sure?
I want to make sure you have everything you need.
You can make short ribs in it. It falls right off...
So, I think I had a wet nightmare last night.
Okay, Peter, can I talk to you for a second?
I'm sorry, but I am not going to stand for any misogyny.
It's 2019. Time-tested jokes like that are now offensive and not funny at all.
They're way in the back, but I'm sitting next to Courtney.
Someone has stolen the old Quagmire and replaced him with a respectable man.
That's right. I made that up. Now go get 'em, kiddo.
I can't believe my dad knows how to fly this thing.
You don't even need a college degree, which is a very scary true fact. Go ahead.
I'm glad you guys could finally come over for dinner.
Now, Courtney, I'd like to awkwardly introduce you to someone your own age.
I just got on there and need some interesting peeps
Hey, Dad, I just checked the weather, and it looks like sunny skies all weekend.
Cleveland, Jerome, Bruce, Opie, Carl, the phony guy, the ostrich, Al Harrington,
Billy Finn, John Travolta from one of our cutaways, uh, all of our characters as Star Wars characters, everybody from The Cleveland Show,
Cherry Chevapravatdumrong... that's how that name is pronounced... the Orville... the ship, not the cast... um, me... Aw, damn it!
I'm really glad you decided to bring Meg on this camping trip, Peter.
You don't get air like this back in Quahog, do you, Pete?
Hoo-ah! Gosh, being in nature gives me such great energy.
And the first event, worth five points, is a race down to the lake right now!
What Meg didn't know, what none of them knew, is that I already was a stinky poo-poo egg.
Boy, you don't get stars like this back in Quahog, do you, Pete?
Oh, just sitting on the invisible bench, reading about those North Korea jokesters.
First, I throw a rope over this tree limb, put the noose around my neck.
Now I'll just step onto this rock and jump off into the sweet relief of death.
Yeah, okay, whatever gets it away from my daughter's face.
We're just two dads bonding with our daughters, and getting lost is not part of the plan.
It is so nice to get out of the city and meet friendly people.
We're not lost! We're just... two dads in the woods, who love our daughters very, very much.
Well, you chose it. I didn't. That's for damn sure!
I've been waiting for this. I knew it was fake.
I don't want to be out here! I hate camping!
And what the hell was the theme of that stupid prom?!
I mean, if it was, Oh, What a Knight with a K, that would've made some sense,
Damn it, I just want to be home, not here, lost in the woods, looking at this stupid map with a magnifying glass.
If I was sitting on the couch, watching TV, ignoring you completely.
You mean when you completely ripped my school dance theme?
No, I'm-I'm talking about being your father before I was ready.
I promise, if we make it out of here, we can start again.
Wow, Peter, that was a close call with that fire, but I'm glad you all made it back safe and sound.
I mean, what is the deal with women and pillows?
The Ox-Bow Incident is a tale of cowboys, cattle and conflict.
Okay, welcome to Family Guy DVD commentary for episode 1614.
I'm Peter Griffin, joined by my wife Lois, our dog Brian, and our children, Meg, Stewie and Chris.
And for you kids out there, DVDs were plastic discs...
Have you ever been at your grandmother's house and you look at her weird, old computer, and there's, like, a crack on the side of it?
Lot of people don't know this, but that house is actually in Burbank.
We now return to Winona Ryder Distracting from Other Speeches in History.
Winona Ryder kind of hung out on set all day, and it, uh, wore a little thin on all of us.
Yeah, I actually had to close a door on her at one point.
I-I just remember she stole a ton of LUNA Bars from the office kitchen.
Yeah, the network doesn't like us using the names of actual companies on the show.
I want to be the first to get the new phone.
There's a secretary looking for reassurance about her overly short haircut.
Stop pretending to stare at your phones, and just say you hate it.
I'm gonna give personal facts about each of the names that pops up.
Kids, time to gather up our old cords and chargers that no longer work and throw them in the garbage.
Don't you know a lot of discarded electronics end up in the ocean and kill sea turtles?
That was cool. I got to go to Fiji for that.
Oh, this is where I fight that woman for the phone.
You know, I actually had a couple of ad-libs about Chinese working conditions that somehow didn't make it into the final cut.
Peter, I'm just not sure it's such a great idea that everyone in the family got a new cell phone.
This is why we need a Sharpie in here to put our names on our water!
She's just gonna keep it like that for the next three years.
You-you can tell a lot about a person whose cell phone screen is cracked.
Like-like, if they're a girl, they definitely celebrate their birth week.
Damn it, those phones have turned you all into mindless drones.
You know, for an extra $12 a month, you can insure your screen, and they'll replace it for free.
You talked over the setup of this cutaway, and now we don't know what's going on.
Oh, I remember. They're all skanks. Getting new phones was a worse idea than a skank robbery.
When I was run out of Boston by the Spotlight team,
But instead, I packed my Bibles and my Tootsie Pops and headed down to Quahog.
With a renewed sense of spirit and a renewed reverence for...
H-Hold on, Danny, it looks like you accidentally gave me Peter's check.
Peter, you always said you made the same as me.
A place where people farm their own food, make their own clothing and read books...
Oh, come on, Lois, you only want to go to Old Sturbridge Village 'cause you once got hand-blasted there on a field trip.
Yes, let's just say the candles weren't the only thing being hot-dipped.
You can explain to me why my husband makes four times as much money as I do.
Mr. Griffin was able to negotiate a higher salary because he's still paying alimony to his first wife. First wife? What?
How come you never told me you were married before?
Wait, isn't she that actress who's always biting her lip?
Come on, Sarah Paulson's been in a lot of stuff, Chris.
But I would legitimately suggest that people pause this right now and Google her.
Wait. Wasn't Sarah Paulson a guest star in this exact episode?
Not for real, though. For real, she's actually coming into the booth right now to be part of this commentary.
That's okay. It seems just like when I would do ADR for American Horror Story, for which I have received five Emmy nominations.
Well, some of us have awards, some of us have children.
I'll pretend to be sick to get out of going to Old Sturbridge Village.
Oh, I wish you were feeling well enough to come.
Maybe I should stay home and take care of you.
So, Lois, what will you be wearing to the Emmys this year?
I left it in the kitchen at work, hoping someone would take it.
Man, this is an even better scam than Ferris Bueller's Day On.
Okay, I need you to file these and not be working with a shampoo Mohawk.
So, Sarah, I-I guess you chose not to take Peter's name, huh?
Yeah, his name just felt kind of, I don't know, rough, you know? Griffin.
I also won an Emmy for my performance as Marcia Clark in The People vs. O.J. Simpson.
Oh, right, this is where the fat man got stuck in the banister slats.
Stewie, I'm gonna give you another crack at that, because I believe what you meant to call them was baluster slats, not banister slats. Banister, baluster. Same thing.
A banister is the handrail that sits atop the upright supports.
So, the baluster is that big, round thing at the bottom of the stairs
I believe what you're referring to is a newel post.
We have to deliver this episode to the network today.
Oh, you guys are back just in time for my big role.
You don't even have an entry on the Family Guy wiki.
In colonial times, butter and soap were the same thing.
I get that it's a fact, but how is it fun?
How the hell am I gonna get out of this?
PETER: I'll tell you what it is: an homage to a classic song from The Muppet Show, sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.
How the hell was this not cut from the show?
I actually laid in my parking space as a protest until they gave in.
Um, are they setting up a buffet lunch for us after this?
Sorry to break it to you... that's not a joke.
First, I find out you make four times what I do.
Well, if we're being honest, Lois, you're really bad at having sex when I'm drunk.
They're not even going to explain how we all got stuck?
Like when I figured out the secret of business: pointing at stuff during meetings.
These montage-style cutaway gags provide the animators the freedom to go beyond the page, as we say.
It was in his trailer during that tornado chasing movie.
Enjoy spending the rest of your life alone, and enjoy doing the show without me, 'cause I quit! building a chair with my male friends.
You know, if you need a new Lois, I do a pretty good one.
How the hell are we gonna get out of here?
Even more than when we were literally in the game Trouble.
If you're just joining us, Lois has stormed out and announced that she's quitting the show after learning that Peter and Sarah Paulson were once married.
She also said Chris's dad might be Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Okay, there's also a real rock you can throw through the glass.
You think your mother's actually serious about divorcing me and quitting the show?
And what was all that stuff about Chris not being my son?
Hey, remember the one day that guy who plays the burglar was on set, he was passing out postcards for his one-man show?
Wasn't bad. I think I sat next to his girlfriend,
Hey, Brian, they used your account to buy a karaoke machine.
I-I gotta go find your mother, talk some sense back into her.
I'm actually here to tell you there's no need to talk sense into Lois.
Or for anyone to leave the show, because none of you are real.
If I'm not real, then why does a fat nerd pretend to be me at every Comic-Con?
And if you're me, then why do you sound like my dog?
So, the guy who handles your money, he knows you by voice, right?
Wait a second. If Dad's not real, then he's not really my dad, which means I'm not real?
Why is the girl who voices me super hot and I'm not?
You know, believe it or not, I've actually had two kids.
Um, Ms. Kunis, I would just like you to know that I have no problem with you breastfeeding in this booth.
Oh, Seth, since you're here, would you mind recording episodes 17, 14, 15, 16, and an NFL on Fox promo?
Well, the captain of the Orville says that none of us are real... We're all cartoon characters.
Uh, my name's Alex Borstein, and I do your voice on the show.
Are you saying the rough-edged comedy manager from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel does my voice?
Peter, I-I'm not even sure what this means, but it sure makes it seem less important how much money you make compared to me or that maybe you neglected to tell me everything about your past.
I love you, and whatever we share, whether it's real or not,
So let's just bury our troubles and cling to whatever this is.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Philip Seymour Hoffman.
The truth is, you should all be thankful you're animated characters.
Peter, you can drink as much as you want, and nothing bad will ever happen.
Stewie, you get to travel through time and do things no baby could ever do.
And, Brian, you've had sex with more hot women than a real dog could ever reasonably expect.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need all the real actors to form a human shield around me so I can get out of the building without the American Dad people seeing me.
I know. That right there was the main reason we split up.
Wiped out by the German aphid, which was oddly brought by the Swedes during the Great Depression...
Which, for those of you who are too young, was like a decade-long case of the Mondays.
Well, I'm guessing you folks are from out of town, too.
Well, you guys, I guess we all learned something about not letting technology rule our lives.
And, Mom, next time we get baluster slats, let's make sure there's enough room to get our heads out.
Now let's all go around the horn and say what our favorite part of the episode was.
Okay, Stewie's asleep, and I can see Brian driving away in his car.
And just so you know, he doesn't drive a Prius like you see on the show.
I see you're still here. You want to say something?
We really have to spend the whole day cleaning out the garage?
You know I have plans today to go see Pervert Hamlet.
To be... with this skull sexually, or not to be... with this skull sexually.
I answered when I was with this skull sexually a little while ago.
Screw this. Quick, before your mother gets back, everything in the garbage.
I took it from a front lawn after a rain storm.
Oh, my God. There's a hot woman over at the bar.
You know, I never forget the back of a head.
I'm sure that kind of thing works great for the younger crowd, but I'm 44.
Look, I'm not some bimbo who falls for tired pickup lines.
Oh, I was just gonna drive through some puddles and see how long my tracks stay wet.
Boy, I tell ya, no better way to start your day than a morning dump in a neighbor's yard.
It was a soft steamer, almost impossible to pick up.
Peter threw out a bunch of stuff from the garage yesterday.
Threw it out? But today is our trash pick up day!
Really? Can't we just maybe buy you a new one?
Yep, went over a speed bump really fast and broke my hymen.
I have to correct you there, Brian. I'm a man.
Yes, we are in search of a Big Wheel that was erroneously discarded and collected today.
Oh, then it probably came in with the morning load.
Usually the newest, top layer of trash just blows right into the ocean.
Yeah, I'm afraid your Big Wheel may be gones for good.
Damn it. Monica's not responding to any of my texts.
Lois, maybe you could help me ask out this woman I met.
Just ask her if she's all caught up on This Is Us.
Great. This is exactly the stuff I need to know.
Lois, will you teach me the ways of the middle-aged woman?
Thanks, Lois. This could open up a whole new world for me.
Like one of those kids who gets a device that allows them to hear for the first time.
Your mom and I are going to get a divorce.
I'm in love with someone else, and I didn't want to say it with the silly hands.
If it ended up in the ocean, it most likely has traveled to Garbage Island.
The other name for the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, an enormous cluster of man-made debris floating in the middle of the ocean.
Oh, uh, I can't be in stories for a couple of episodes.
All right, time to retrieve my Big Wheel from Garbage Island.
Hey, how'd you get the money to rent this boat anyway?
Okay, technically, I work at the weird, in-store Pizza Hut.
Feed it to your fat kid while you buy off-brand tennis shoes.
Now, Glenn, I'm gonna help you get into the mind of a middle-aged woman.
STEP ONE: We all go frigging nuts over Yankee Candles, so to help you learn all the flavors, I made a little quiz.
I'm gonna give you a name, and you tell me if it's the name of a Yankee Candle or a porn star.
Very good. I tried to trick you there, but you got it. Both.
But, Lois, Monica agreed to have dinner with me tomorrow.
But I don't think I can pull it off by myself.
Will you come and just be nearby to give me tips and help me get through it?
Friday nights are when Peter and I do edibles and go to the aquarium.
Stewie, I'm starting to wonder if we didn't think this all the way through.
It'll all be worth it once we get to Garbage Island.
Well, if my reading material has taught me anything, it's just a cloud with lips.
So, um, I noticed a yoga mat in the back of your car.
My, um... my-my dad locked himself out of his car.
Um, no, uh, no. He, um, he broke, uh... broke the window with his foot.
Another thing I was just thinking about is... AMBER Alert, white Honda Accord, license plate... Uh, uh, I mean,
Listen, what if we just bail on dinner and head back to my place?
What? Oh, my God, I've never heard that. Mickey D's. That is just great.
Now how the hell are we supposed to get back to land?
Oh, look, a message in a bottle is washing up.
Dear England: Enclosed, please find one bottle fart in exchange for Russell Brand.
Get back home? Why would we want to do that?
Hey, so, we've been stuck out here for over 20 years.
Can you catch us up on all the important things that we've missed?
A-And so what about Craig Kilborn? Is he still on?
Yeah, no, what I realized is that all those texts you sent me, they're like my bible now.
I just keep using these same tips on different women.
You've opened up a whole world of middle-aged legs to me.
Oh, my God. Quagmire's terrorizing middle-aged women, and I'm responsible for it.
I believe the Big Wheel may actually be our ticket off the island.
You see, I've calculated that, even with both of our weights, it will still be capable of flotation.
My plan is to attach six Jimmy Buffett margarita machines to it, which should be able to propel us home.
O-Okay, I-I don't think I can talk to you, because, right now, you're making less sense than an M.C. Escher floor plan.
And I've lost, like, ten of my guys in here.
Glenn Quagmire, I tried to help you meet a nice woman, but you just couldn't help yourself, could you?
I thought I was helping you find love, and, instead, you used me as a tool to get down every middle-aged woman's pants in town.
You were kind to me, and I took advantage of it.
I'll buy you a coffee, and... do you like the music of Ray... LaMountain? LaMontagne.
Thank you. Hey, beautiful, you want to take a pointless girl-stride walk and listen to Ray LaMontagne?
I know it's weird to say, but... it's kind of just too perfect for me here.
Fort Lauderdale Tanya found a four-piece puzzle she's been struggling with.
So long take very good care dear friend of mine farewell.
From the moment we arrived, I've either been drunk or ejaculating.
You're an enormously important part of my life, Brian, and I couldn't bear the thought of losing you.
I assumed it unlikely you'd change your mind, so I added the fans from many, many Dell laptops to the back of my Big Wheel so I could simply tow everyone back to land.
You can throw away just about anything in this world, but you can't throw away a friendship.
You do what you got to do, you gross dog.
Ugh. I can't believe you dragged me to The Flow.
Last time I did that, the kids walked in on you looking at Internet corn.
We'll be starting the taping in just a few minutes, but I wanted to come out here personally and say hi to my fans.
Let's get everyone up, up, up and dancing like maniacs.
Let's welcome our first guest, my colleague at Channel 5 and now a best-selling author,
I understand it's been number one on Amazon for many weeks, long time.
I came up with it after hiking to the top of Mount Asia and meditating on Epiphany Bridge.
Ah! Peter, these are Asian techniques, and they're new to me.
I have to buy this book, read two chapters, then leave it on my nightstand for a year.
I'm really excited you're humanely relocating me to outside your house.
Oh, yeah. Me and the fellas thought it was time.
Everyone, I just read Tricia Takanawa's book, and it was really inspiring.
She says that when you de-clutter your house, you de-clutter your mind and clear a path to true happiness.
So I want everyone to go through every single item you own, and if it doesn't kindle joy, throw it away.
Well, she's searching for something to fill her empty life.
You remember when she thought the solution was putting a lemon slice in a plain glass of water for a very simple kind of pleasure?
And just the thing to wash down six Xanax from four different prescriptions.
Box of cords that go to computers from the 1980s.
Woody and Buzz, who definitely are not alive, so I can turn my back... on them!
I hate to do this, guys, but Peter's been compromised.
Oh, look, my box of ribbons I've saved from various presents.
Oh, I'm not throwing that out. That's a good ribbon.
I just wanted to know if I could borrow a ribbon.
If you love Game of Thrones on HBO, you'll love Cinemax's Boob Dragons.
I glued it. Surfin' Bird, uh, uh, uh, finds a way.
So, Lois, what's your next bored housewife seeking purpose in life project after de-cluttering?
What's your next fake writing project, a rap opera about Grover Cleveland?
Mine is a '70s funk musical about William Howard Taft.
Oh, I don't. I just rolled around in the sand and brought home this bucket of alive crabs.
When the clutter is gone, the path to happiness is clear.
Lois, you could just pee in these like a space suit, right?
I'm sorry, but I'm looking at you, and I'm just not feeling joy.
I don't think I can have you in the house right now.
That your parents pay for entirely, but I get to put the mortgage coupon in the mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that clearly says Not legal tender into the mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while Chris puts a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox while I hold the plastic door open for him?
No problem, Peter. I'm sure Lois'll cool down in a few days, and you'll be back home.
Yeah, she'll be fine. And you won't even know I'm here.
I mean, I need to keep up with my workouts.
And I can't sleep unless I have Dunkirk on at full volume.
It's the foundation of my look, but we can discuss it.
I feel like they're clutter. I feel like you don't need them.
Ha! A clean house means a clean soul, and a clean soul is a happy one.
The truth is I should have asked you to leave after the other night.
Ugh! Just read him the story. Clifford was just too big for the bathtub.
Clifford big! So they decided to hose him in the yard instead, but Clifford couldn't fit through the door.
I get to sleep with all my stuff in a storage unit on the highway access road.
I tell you to clean your rooms, and the first thing you do is put all your science projects in Stewie's closet?
And give me those glasses. They're cluttering up your face.
You realize there are four of us and one of her.
Chris, I will not have your comic strip anger cluttering up my house.
You know, Lois, one could argue that your bra is clutter.
My house is at peace, so I am at peace.
Your soul is as empty as this house, this house, this house.
But I did what the book said. I did it all.
Why didn't it work? Why am I still not happy?
Looks like there's only one thing left to get rid of.
What's that? Words, letters, letters and words, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, more words and letters.
No, I know the letters when they're on their own, but, you know, when they team up like this,
I'm just, uh... I'm sort of outmatched. It was my fault, not yours. I'm so sorry, and I love you all. Goodbye. P.S. Please throw this note out.
Dad, how can you be so sure Mom is at Mount Asia?
We cut a whole scene where we figured it out.
I don't even care that I left my phone in my pocket.
You made me lose my balance, but when I landed in all that garbage,
Literally, yes, but also it saves my life every day.
The fact that every little thing you see kindles joy for you...
And I'm gonna try to have that attitude from now on.
Oh, just leave it for now. We'll deal with it later.
Yeah, that de-cluttering thing was nice for a while, but I definitely went overboard.
I don't know. Somehow, an idea I got from a two-minute segment on a morning talk show didn't bring me the life satisfaction
On the bright side, our sparse, white living room looks like the John Lennon, Yoko Ono Imagine living room.
We can't afford Imagine, so just imagine this is Imagine.
Hey, Chris, what's the name of the girl on the end of the couch? I'm sure I've met her before.
I'll introduce myself to her. That'll get her to say it.
All your favorite YouTubers, Instagrammers, social media mavens and digital influencers under one roof.
Social media? Better swap my glasses for a monocle that will pop out when I'm confronted with modern talk.
Meet disgraced YouTube star Logan Paul and his cool bus, the Golden Throated Homeless Guy and his cool bus he poops in,
And I'm gonna be live and in-person at the Quahog Streaming-Con, where you'll see I'm only five-foot-two.
And remember, that Nazi stuff I said was in the heat of a very competitive Halo game.
And congratulations to Goldblatt69, whose people definitely do not control the media and all banking.
Oh, awesome. Look over there. You can take a selfie in a hospital bed to get social media attention. Don't really want to get into it, but I'm fine.
Oh, boy. Well, this is the last thing I wanted.
I'm gonna do a Instagram story here where I insult a loner and it becomes a whole thing.
So check this out, guys. I got kicked out of Streaming-Con 2019.
Now, I don't know if anyone watching this is a lawyer, especially a constitutional lawyer, but...
You know, like, on the back of Triscuits when they give you the recipes for those snacks?
Hey, guys, I'm in an Uber, heading back to Streaming-Con.
Hey, you know how Snapchat puts a fake dog tongue on you?
My guest today is a white music writer who has written a book about the history of hip-hop.
Hip-hop has its roots in the call-and-response tradition of the Southern black Baptist church.
And, of course, you can't write a history of rap without mentioning Gil Scott-Heron...
And today, I'm gonna show you how anyone can become an Internet celebrity, like me, Corey from Corey's World.
I bet you can't make my daughter Meg an Internet celebrity.
You can make them with ingredients you probably already have in the house.
Ugh! It's like I dropped a tomato in some hay.
All right, Meg, now that you're an Internet personality, we got to build your brand.
Is there anything you can do in front of your dad?
All right, we're taking your bedroom door off the hinges.
Either way, we'll have it towed back to San Francisco.
Hey, there are plenty of closer gay cities, you big ape.
We have a pink Volkswagen Beetle you might feel comfortable in.
Thought I'd give you a tour of my refrigerator lifestyle.
Don't forget to wash the tip of your middle finger when you're done.
See, I-I promoted Magic Shell ice cream topping on my channel,
I created a vanilla ice cream Peter covered in Magic Shell.
Oh-oh, my God, I-I don't know which one to believe.
What do you mean? I'm a guy, and he's ice cream.
Does anyone mind if I turn the thermostat down to 32 degrees?
Five different stations, all playing Lick It Up by Kiss.
Well, it's nice of you to once again drive me to day care, Brian.
I just hope I don't get branded a Hummer guy.
Yes, but I like how when you cut to an outside shot,
When you need to take a talking baby to day care, you'll move mountains.
And if the mountains won't move, drive right over 'em.
Nothing. When you have a million followers, people just pay you to hang out.
Yo, yo, yo! Everything here is made with corn syrup!
The one where you're supposed to shame her, not feel sorry for her.
But I need to draw a little more blood for the lab.
Me too. The moon, though slight, was moon enough to show On every tree a bucket with a lid,
Coming up, local anchor brings a concealed weapon to work, as is his right.
But first, popular Internet star Meg Griffin has Type 2 diabetes, and is also the new face of diabetes drug Pancresta.
If diabetes has you down, get your insulin levels up with Pancresta.
Do not take Pancresta if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant.
If you have a problem with addiction, do not take Pancresta, as smoking Pancresta may mimic the otherworldly high of heroin.
Chopping up and snorting Pancresta may amplify and/or enhance sexual experience.
Pancresta can be delivered directly to your home, and since we're here, why not, we'll do a bump.
I'm not sure how it works, but I do know you could go blind, you could have organ failure, you could lose your feet.
James Woods High School will also be saluting their own diabetic Internet celebrity with a pep rally in her honor this Thursday.
Sponsored by Pancresta, which feels like being inside the warm, wet mouth of the Lord.
I'm not a Hummer guy, Stewie. I'm a responsible Prius driver who's making the best of a bad situation.
I also didn't ask for these slowpokes in front of me.
Brian, that's Paul McCartney doing Carpool Karaoke songs we can afford.
Refrigerator Meg here having one of my favorite snacks: french fry sandwiches on white bread.
I have a gift for knowing when something bad happens to someone's legs, kind of like a shining.
I-I don't know. All I know is I love this Hummer.
Well, let's see... I drive about 4,000 a year, so when this car goes, I'll be...
I'll miss scaring the hell out of homeless people with your cruise-ship-grade air horn.
I'll miss catching the eye of women smoking outside of government buildings.
But mostly, I'll miss driving a military vehicle to get Crest Whitestrips.
She passed away last month. She was addicted to Pancresta, so she didn't so much pass away as elevate to a higher level of consciousness.
Just turned into a smiling beam of light right before my eyes.
She told me to be at peace, and I was.
I'm hearing a lot of good stuff about this Pancresta.
Looks like you got the Hummer for another couple of days at least.
And Brian and Stewie got tossed clear up to New Hampshire.
If anyone remembered what we look like, it would be shocking how fat we are.
You've inspired us to gain all this weight, and we just wanted to say thanks.
Feet. Those little weirdos on the end of your legs.
I used mine to mosey on over to the A story.
I'm going out there to warn everybody about the dangers of unhealthy eating.
I was gonna take you to prom as part of a cruel bet, but I'm fat now, too!
I want to talk to you guys about something important.
But from here on, my fridge will be full of fruits, vegetables and lean meats! Yo, yo, yo!
Did you hear that all the Jewish kids stayed home from school that day?
Brian and Stewie got thrown into New Hampshire by the Hulk, and you're a beam of light.
We're glad you could come over for dinner tonight, Carol.
I've been having such a hard time since Adam passed away.
I want to squeeze your butt and then take your pants down and look at your butt!
He was such a great mayor, and a great uncle to the kids.
I'm leaving. I know-I know what I did. I'm leaving.
I just wish there was some way we could honor
I'll make a special video dedication reminding people of how great Mayor West was.
Well, you're a talking dog... you probably know what you're doing.
The only thing that's left to do now is for you to pay the normal $1,000 principal meeting fee.
Principal Shepherd, someone named Eddie Payups is here to see you.
Anyway, great idea. We'll have a ceremony to change the name of the school this week.
Well, you know, it was the right thing to do, Brian.
Like when I had to give bad news to that improv team.
I called you here to tell you that you're all 45 years old.
Thank you, everybody, for coming today as we honor one of Quahog's finest citizens,
We will start today's ceremony with the traditional to honor our wacky but beloved mayor.
Beautiful. Now, to unveil our new sign, we've invited HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines, who are here to prove that their show didn't ruin their marriage.
All right, Quahog, are you ready to see your new sign?
Thank you. Uh, please, uh, stick around for refreshments and snacks in the gymnasium.
Do you need me to walk you to your car in case the studio audience guy shows up?
I just wanted to thank you for what you did today for Adam.
You know, I see a lot of him in you.
I came here to say that what you did was very honorable.
It showed real leadership, and I think you should be the next mayor of Quahog.
Of course he did. He was vice president, and before that, a United States senator.
So, Carol was just going on and on about how I should be mayor.
And it's got me thinking, it is an interesting idea.
The one time I give you a chance, you're not ready.
Meg, you miss 100% of the farts you don't take.
Welcome back, Quahog. And now it's time for a new segment on our show called On the Same Sofa, in which a guest and I have a conversation while sitting on the same sofa.
And thank you for allowing me up on the furniture.
That gives you a bit of an advantage, doesn't it?
Well, we've now reached the middle of the interview, where I ask the guest, How's the sofa so far?
So, Brian, I understand you like eating your own poop.
I can't believe we're gonna have a dog for mayor.
Yeah, Tosh does it all the time. Put it up.
He looks like an angry face drawn on a thumb.
Or the mayor who won't close the beaches in Jaws.
You know that's a guy who's roughly led his wife out of parties by the elbow.
Yeah, but either way, he's that Little League coach the parents hope their kids don't get.
He looks like a fish that inflates to scare predators.
The inside trader who kills himself the day his prison sentence is supposed to start.
I feel like that's a dad who's ripped his kid's posters off the wall.
He looks like a pelican trying to swallow a fish that's too big.
Friends brings me a lot of joy, so can we stop this?
Uh, can you hang on? I'm finishing a phone interview.
And that's why I would never joke about the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy.
Why are you doing this? Why are you running for mayor?
Well, you're just wasting your time, because you're not gonna win.
The only thing I'm afraid of are fire truck sirens and things that look like faces.
I was thinking, like, a collared shirt, jacket, no tie.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker, and I will be your moderator for tonight's mayoral debate.
Not because I want to, but because it counts as community service for open-hand smacking an Uber Eats guy.
I was gonna wear a tie. He told me not to.
First question: as candidates for mayor, how do I put my apps into a folder?
It's irresponsible for the town to get two credit cards and just swap the balance back and forth each month.
Whoa, so I can just name the folder whatever I want? Tom's Stuff.
What the... None of that aired? I was totally winning.
Why would you wear a tie to a casual debate?
And, you're not gonna, like, bring pizza for everyone, right?
Right, they' have food there. Okay, so, no tie, no pizza.
Let's cut the crap. The only reason you're running is... to make me look ridiculous.
And I am not just some idiot to be laughed at and not taken seriously.
You idiot! He's allergic to getting hit in the head!
Yes, our bus went over a cliff. We need help.
Oh, my God, how are we gonna get down from here?
The more you say it, the more it doesn't sound like anything.
I can't believe this. I'm gonna die with Glenn Quagmire.
Hey, dying with Glenn Quagmire was good enough for Googardo.
Please don't use the familiar form of a guy's name you never knew.
What was I thinking getting on this bus with you?
It was dumber than when Peter hired that raccoon accountant.
Yeah, there's some edible underwear in that bag over there.
I have a ball of peanut butter with a pill inside.
Mayor West told me he went to 65 pancake breakfasts a year.
That-That's, like, pancakes every Saturday morning and probably some Sundays.
And sometimes it's, like, kids making the pancakes, and-and you get these mondo huge ones.
Are you kidding me? at least eight to ten chocolate chip pancake events.
And now that I say it out loud, eight to ten sounds low.
Well, pancakes and... look at the people in our town.
You know, when you think about it, we're really the only two viable candidates.
Like I'm good company, and I'm smart and funny, and I'm invited to all your pool parties.
And I should just come over if I hear one of them going on.
I'm not gonna say something I don't mean just because your ego needs to hear it.
Because I know that's the only reason you were doing this.
Screw this. We just got to get out of this bus.
Regardless of what we think of each other, this is no way for us to die.
Oh, my God. You just got hit in the throat with a gentleman's dildo.
He got hit in the throat with a gentleman's dildo.
I can't believe they canceled the election after they thought Brian and Mr. Quagmire were dead.
Who do you think should be the next mayor of Quahog.
Yeah, he's fine. He's having one of his private pool parties.
So I'm here to ask you to make me the mayor of your town.
Why did everyone have to come in on a Monday?
Due to budget cuts, we'll be laying off one employee.
The Internet pretty much only lets us fire white males, so if you're not a white male, you're safe.
It used to happen a lot in the '70s but doesn't seem to happen that much anymore. to a bygone era when men settled their differences
And while we're talking about stuff, I've never cleaned my ice trays.
Carrying an ice tray from the freezer to the sink is like ringing
Come to think of it, but I don't remember seeing a few short hairs in my ice cubes
Oh, you're crazy. It was a tip of the hat to my son.
Merry Christmas. Here's a warmed-over turd from ten years ago.
No need to be nervous. Just show 'em that I'm good at my job.
Hey, Ernie. I mean, I mean Cookie Monst... I mean Bert.
But I wouldn't mind getting to know that Sheila a little better.
Oh, sure, if Sheila and her wastemaker are gonna be there.
I would murder my family for one hour with Corinne.
And for some reason, it's all just the sort of gay moments.
Do you remember if you put your wrist to your forehead like a nancy-boy when you fainted?
I'm texting you a link to a collection of songs called yacht rock.
I play this music, and it really mellows me out.
Did the doctor give you anything to help, you know, mellow you out?
No, he just gave me this link for something called yacht rock.
This one's called Summer Breeze, and it makes me feel fine.
Uh, guys, there's a yacht rock cruise that leaves from the Quahog Marina tomorrow.
You know what, guys? We haven't gone anywhere in a long time.
'cause the guys are going on a yacht rock cruise.
I spent the next two and a half years cruising various aquariums.
I got to say, Peter, I had reservations about this cruise, but you do seem more relaxed.
Hey, good thing I had reservations on this cruise, huh?
I knew this was a possibility, so I put a 1982 Mattel Electronic Baseball game in your bag.
Well, it's not my fault you guys are too stupid to understand what the plan was.
Are my toes tapping? I feel like my toes are tapping.
Whenever I wear my Tevas, my toes are up for grabs.
I may bail to the room to catch a nap.
Oh, yeah, that's why I brought along a couple of these babies.
Hi there, do you know if singer and songwriter Bob Welch is on board yet?
Okay, for the first game, I choose Alan Parsons as my teammate, but not The Project.
No problem. Crosby, Stills, Nash to see who goes first?
Well, maybe you'd prefer my song in Caddyshack, I'm Alright.
Wh-What, do you think I'm stupid because I'm in a chair?
This is so exciting. What do you want to do tonight?
We can see a movie at home. We need to go out.
Why do you always want to hang out with other people when we're on vacation?
Right, because I'm so interested in the medical supply business.
Well, I feel like this has become a referendum on me, and I don't appreciate it.
I'm going to watch the magic show in the Cognac Club.
I can show you where there's a whole pile of those.
Yeah. The wind blows them all to this one spot.
It's my job to clean it up. That's how I know about it.
You want to mess around on some damp towels next to where the seagulls crap?
All I want to do in the middle of the evening
Wow, I've never seen someone eat so many powdered Donettes in half an hour before.
Yeah, I was really hungry, and I didn't like what they had at dinner.
Oh, my God, no one's ever told me that before.
And, look, Oates is hanging on to Hall for dear life.
What else is new? He's been doing that for 40 years.
Ha, ha. Yeah, make fun of more people more successful than you.
This boat has flipped over. We need to get up to the hull.
There's a spot in the propeller room where the hull's only an inch thick.
We got to get out of here. The water levels are rising fast.
Granny Smith? What, do you got a oven in your mouth?
That's a garbage apple. May as well eat a Honeycrisp.
Gosh, Cleveland, I had no idea you knew so much about apples.
I think the only way to teach you a lesson is to dog-shake and get you all wet.
Well, we found the thinnest part of the hull, but it's still an inch thick.
Yeah, of steel. How are we supposed to get through that?
Coming in at number seven on the countdown, that was Peter Griffin with Yacht Rocky, down three spots.
She writes, Dear Casey, is Christopher Cross as nice as he seems? Also, aren't you dead? And why did your large wife hide your body from your children?
Well, the answer to your first question is a resounding yes.
I'm extremely dead, and I do wish my children could have closure.
That's right, that's right, we had that million-dollar business idea.
Peter, are you just rubbing pocket cloth over your wang?
Damn it, I'm sick of us always forgetting our great ideas when we're drinking.
Thanks. Now maybe you'll take down those three billboards you put up about me.
Yeah, they're not as heavy as I thought they'd be.
And we can live stream the footage on my iPad.
I told you, I'm going to the Clam with the guys.
What does she mean, Can't eat an ear of corn?
I can't help it if my adult teeth never came in.
This Sunday, we turn the Quahog Convention Center into a mud pit for the 28th annual Quahog Monster Truck Rally and gun show.
Watch real loud trucks and smell the smoke that reminds you of your dead alcoholic stepdad who you're glad is dead but still miss anyway.
You will not be the fattest person there, and if you are, get that shirt off!
Come get your picture taken with Tila Tequila, and smoke a cigarette with her.
It's all happening at the Quahog Convention Center, so hold in all your farts till this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
Oh, oh, I got one. Big Tic Tac, so you don't have to eat so many little Tic Tacs.
All right, Peter, you're so great, why don't you give us an idea?
Well, what happens to that ice at the end of the day?
It's wasted. We collect urinal ice and sell it to local bars.
All right, let's check out what we did last night.
Oh, this must have been when we were jumping around to Jump Around, like the song asked us to.
If it's so dumb, how come we're pitching it on Shark Tank?
Now, when we first started Warm Cuts, it was just a gross idea.
But this year, we're on track to get sued for $12.5 million.
I'm in, and I'll give you exactly what you're asking for:
Wait, why are only three of us on Shark Tank?
That's not all right. What if my boss sees this?
Oh, my God. Joe, you have to delete this footage.
Sorry, Glenn, the footage is automatically uploaded to the Internet every night.
No, no, I mean-I mean it's difficult to watch your son embarrass himself so publicly.
Sometimes you want to shake 'em by the shoulders and say, Aah, what are you doing?
But you just got to give 'em the biggest hug you can and let 'em know that you'll always be there for them.
As much as you want to save your kids from their mistakes, it's their mistakes that help them grow and change and become their best selves.
Yep, here I am, Mr. Wisdom, sitting at the bottom of a bottle, just like every Tuesday.
I just wish you could see yourself the way I see you.
Except for a job and your own home, you are the full package, Brian Griffin.
Well, I guess we'll pretend this never happened, and I'll see you in another two years.
I guess I'm just not as hung up as I used to be.
What if somebody finds out I'm in here having goofball sex?
Table 13. The fish is for the gentleman, and the chicken is for the lady.
The fish is for the gentleman, and the chicken is for the lady.
Well, thanks for picking me to break in your new Discover card with.
Brian, I can't help but notice you're a little uncomfortable spending time with me.
Because I made you lie down in the back seat all the way here? You looked tired.
It just seems like you're always taking me to out-of-the-way places to avoid being seen together.
Okay, maybe, maybe this has been a little weirder for me than I thought.
The fish is for me. And the chicken... the chicken is for my girlfriend, Ida Davis. Girlfriend? Are you sure, Brian?
Hi, I have a Styrofoam cooler with weird tape on it?
Ah, that must be the cat brains and baby bodies.
It has to be. Why else would Ida be in our house?
Like, I know Brian was squeamish about sleeping with a trans woman before, but it's 2019 now.
Yeah, things that were gross five years ago are now heroic.
Now the only other person we have to tell about us is Glenn.
After all, I'm not the first person to deliver tough news.
There are many things I can't go into at this time, but I can confirm that a body was removed from Waldo's apartment this morning.
But to that point, instead of always asking Where's Waldo? maybe some of you should've been asking How's Waldo?
Glenn, Ida, it's so nice that you could both come over for dinner.
Uh, actually, I have some news that happens to pertain
I'm so glad you dropped in. Brian is cooking breakfast.
What? How is that a la Brian? That, that's just...
Cool, cool. How many globs of ketchup do you want?
So, um, how long has this been going on, Dad?
Listen, Glenn, I know this is an adjustment for you, and you and Brian haven't always seen eye to eye.
Now, O'Hare Airport, why on the ticket is it ORD?
I'm not gonna go through every airport with you, Brian.
You know, Glenn, Brian thought you two could hang out this afternoon, and I think that's a great idea.
Come on, Glenn. If I'm gonna be dating your mom, it's important that we spend some time together.
Hi, we have two guest passes from a museum member, Ida Davis.
Well, you know, like, the guys are gonna come to life.
Why did you bring up a reference to something you know nothing about?
Brian, don't bring up a reference to someone whose favorite movie it is, because you'll just embarrass yourself.
That was a natural history museum, this is a science museum.
What, you think this tidal chart's gonna come to life?
You think this moon rock is gonna walk across the room and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams playing Teddy Roosevelt, God rest both their souls?
Be very, very careful treading around Night at the Museum.
It's so good for the boys to spend real time together.
Boy, they're in such a hurry not to be kids anymore.
I'm older than the adults. I'm older than all of you!
All right, as the one adult on a team full of children,
I'm gonna act good-natured while being subtly furious at all your mistakes.
Let's focus, Chris. Can we just focus for a minute?
Okay, I'm gonna call the plays while I'm covering my mouth with this play card.
Peter, that's not a play card, it's a Denny's menu.
To do what? I'm the one who scored the touchdown.
I already have a dad, and it's my mom! All right, Brian?
No, I'm not gonna calm down. I can't take this anymore.
Listen, Dad, the first time you hooked up with Brian, it was awful, I hated it.
But you were confused, you'd just gone through a huge change, you didn't know if you had any options, so you settled.
And now you've had time to adjust and your choice is Brian?
Why in God almighty would you choose him? Because I love him, a resolved Ida said.
I can't take this anymore. It's either him or me.
I never thought I'd meet someone who I connected with on so many levels,
But as special as you are to me, I have to put my son first.
I see Peter coming with some kind of problem from the game.
Quagmire, we agreed that it was a two-hand touch, and then Chris hit me with one hand, and I said that didn't count, but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.
So I drilled him in the head with the ball, and now he's not moving.
Yeah, but I don't like little Kyle Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem.
It's the same thing Ryan Lochte listens to before a race.
Under normal circumstances, you'd never be allowed in a place like this.
Damn it, Griffin, you've been staring at that menu for five minutes, and you peed your pants.
Hey, Brian, you don't have a metal detector on you, do you?
Stewie, didn't it strike you as odd that everyone got a medal?
And like every other medal or award you've ever gotten, it means nothing.
Stay calm. This is why we have a house fire captain.
Okay, when I read your name, please respond with a here.
Everyone start crying about losing your new golf clubs and Grant Wood's American Gothic.
Oh, my classic depiction of the austere steadfastness of rural America!
Peter, I spoke with my parents, and we can live with them until our house is fixed.
Ja. Also, I am German and wouldn't mind watching you crap.
Mueslix, the weird European cereal that likes to watch you poop.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling they don't respect me.
I'd been fed a massive societal lie in the form of participant awards.
Hey, kids, how would you like to hear this on the screen instead of the great show you came to see?
Please cooperate and do your part in keeping this theater quiet, so everyone, including you, can enjoy it.
Remember, lots of adults and kids, too, paid admission to enjoy the show.
Otherwise, we will be forced to evict all disturbance makers from the theater.
Those asked to leave today will be refused admission to this theater in the future.
I've deleted all my old tweets, so don't even bother looking for bad stuff.
But, first, it's that time of year again for the annual Quahog Pie Cook-off.
The winner will take home the coveted Pie Champ trophy.
Brian, this could be my chance to finally win a legitimate award.
No more bets. The money that could have gone to your kids is gone. No more bets.
And guy walks quickly away from table without a word, replaced by an older white man with a much younger black woman.
Okay, now I know you're full of crap, because everyone else loves it.
Stewie, can't you see they're faking it to make you feel good?
And the contest is next week. I have to drop out.
No, you don't. You just got to do the work.
I know you can bake a pie, and I'll help you.
No, her alarm didn't go off, so she missed it.
Peter, would you like to join us in a parlor game?
Lois, why do you always start talking like a snob when you're around your parents?
Peter, perhaps the word you were looking for is... forgotten.
You kids are too young to remember that, but your parents are gonna hate it.
I don't know, whenever I'm here, I feel out of place.
You know, Peter, you and I are not so different.
You may think I've always been a part of this high-society world, but I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
My point is, I'm not from an upper-crust world, either.
I just had to act that way to impress Carter, who cared about that stuff.
There's an Ed Sheeran song for every emotion you're feeling right now.
Hey, what do you say we ditch this stuffy place
You know, I've never dropped bowling balls from an overpass before. They fall quick.
It felt good to reconnect with the girl I once was.
Hey, listen, you got to stay true to that girl.
Oh, sometimes I feel trapped in this world, forever trying to live up to everyone else's expectations, especially Carter's.
Well, Brian, I've studied pie-making, and the key is to find the absolute freshest ingredients.
Therefore, we must go wherever and whenever they're to be found.
Home of Sir Isaac Newton and one of history's most famous apples.
And before anyone asks, I brought this owl from home.
Peter, what did the two of you talk about last night?
You can see why I stole this from the owlery...
My mother. After your night together, she told Daddy she's leaving him.
I used to come down to this boardwalk and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets to the seagulls.
Peter, you've been able to stay true to who you were.
Listen, Babs, I understand what you're doing. I really do.
Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois and my stupid mother-in-law, but you got to come home.
And Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda- Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom, do you take Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama- Ka-Dinga-Da-Dinga-Dong
If anyone objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.
Listen, Carter, unless you want to lose Babs forever, you better get down to Weekapaug.
If you want to win her back, maybe, for once, you try to fit into her world.
Daddy, Peter's right. You got to do this for Mom.
All right, fine. I'll take a quick choke-myself-awake nap and be ready to go.
Maybe someday you can come by my store and have all the cake you want.
And maybe this winter, you can go fishing in my ice hole.
Buddy, I think you might be in the wrong place.
Yeah, you get lost on the wrong side of town, boot boy?
I say we take his pants down, see what he's working with.
And while we're at it, give me that pool cue.
Oh. Hey, Babs. I hang out here all the time.
And I'd even take a lie detector test to prove it.
Well, good thing the bar is having Lie Detector Wednesday.
Okay, test over. Carter's never been here in his life.
Let's take his pants down, see what he's working with.
I'll never be the real man you want me to be.
Carter, I appreciate you trying to be the man I want, but being back home here has made me realize you already are.
I've discovered I'm not the same girl I once was.
I thought I wanted this life back, but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best?
Delicious beer, but, still, ours is the life I want, and you are the man I want.
Newport is my home now, and I'm ready to go back there.
Well, I didn't pay for my beer, but I left a hell of a tip.
Damn it, Griffin! You've been staring at that menu for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting in a double pee puddle!
Peter, I'm so relieved that my mother's back with my dad.
Chris, you... do you want a... You want a Tom Brady kiss?
My name is Von Jiener, and I'm Vice President of Creative Bankruptcy for the Fox TV network, which, at the time of this writing, is still a thing that exists.
I can tell you all watch a lot of free network television.
You have been selected to be part of a focus group that could affect one of America's most beloved television shows: Family Guy.
And since Fox is now owned by Disney, which will someday be owned by Netflix, which will someday be owned by Pornhub, we have decided that Family Guy is ready for a reboot.
Reboot? I thought they said it was a couple of tweaks.
Now, as most unfunny women will tell you, women are very funny.
That's why our first reboot is built around the very popular Louise.
You know, I just want to say again that you were totally right last night to bring up that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.
And please feel free to bring it up again anytime, even if we're talking about something completely unrelated.
Yeah, we're network TV gay, so all we can do is adopt children and pucker-kiss, no tongue stuff.
Well, I'm off to my high-powered job at a fashion magazine, greeting card company or winery.
Great. I worked out, made dinner, a little family time, and had Peter's ankles up in the air by 11:00.
This is gonna be worse than finding a spider in the kitchen.
I hit a gay jogger on my way to work today.
I found a pouch of Big League Chew earlier, and my jaw is worn out.
Aw, I just don't know what to do about this thing at work.
We talked about it before dinner and-and during dinner and after dinner.
My testosterone is so low I could not have thought of that.
Would you like me to put on our sleep ocean noises with an occasional shocking seagull screech?
Now, I know you're all wondering who is going to get the big promotion, and I'm proud to announce that person is Smarmy...
Excuse me, where do I put this briefcase full of money?
Lois Griffin just landed my account through her wit, charm and professionalism.
Is that so? Well, in that case, the big promotion goes to Lois Griffin!
And please keep in mind that your spontaneous comments will affect the jobs of hundreds of people.
The show is from a woman's perspective, but it still felt like it was written by a man.
I'm sorry, I was scrolling through the weather in random cities.
You just need to have grown up in the '80s but still be a teenager.
So, based on that one episode featuring Lois, how many of you would likely watch a second?
It's a focus group of Arby's executives watching us eat.
People will eat anything! a third Big Beef 'n Cheddar. Who's on it?
Many recent shows have found success by rebooting themselves as gritty supernatural teen dramas, like Teen Wolf or Riverdale, which are watched by as many as 6,000 people a year, so we thought a similar approach might work for Family Guy.
I'm guessing we're wrong, but let's find out for sure.
Thanks, Chris. We're almost ready for the important sports game.
Also, I'm the town sheriff, but you don't find that out till later because it's not relevant to the story.
I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into and listen to a band that's on a label owned by the same parent company as the network.
It just doesn't make sense. Who would want to kill Meg?
We've been asked to nod our heads while the band plays the song our parent company is aggressively marketing.
I'm gonna go get some air and pebble-up my nipples.
You guys, check it out. Patty just got into the college for people with bright futures.
Oh, cool. Is she still gonna major in lot to live for?
Yep. I think she's the one kid who's gonna get out of this sexy town.
I just have to drink a product- placement beverage first.
Oh, I hope nothing happened to the most disposable member of our cast.
Boy, she... she did stiffen up those nips, didn't she?
Guys, it's time to fire up our superpowers, because we're also lesser-known Marvel characters.
And I'm your neighbor, who you didn't know was also a superhero, Captain Pedantic.
Now one of us will become a breakout movie star and leave the series, wrecking it for the rest of us.
Okay. And how many of you would watch it if the girls were wearing white shirts and black bras?
What? Course not. And if you're impressed by the size of Alexander Skarsgard's penis, that doesn't make you gay, right?
I know you've been here all day, but it's not like you have jobs to go to, so I'm going to show you one more reboot idea.
Sometimes networks will cancel a show only to reboot it with less-popular characters from the original, while the more-popular actors go on to find greater success in movies or ugly public divorces.
Family Guy Again is filmed before a live studio audience.
Or should I say, G'day, mate, since you're in Queensland, Australia, where you moved with Brian and Meg after Mom and Dad died?
No, still no kids, but I've been practicing a lot by myself.
Between you and me, I think Tricia might be barren.
Uh, Stewie, I better go. Tricia's giving me that look.
Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg, and hopefully we can come down there for the season finale.
No? You're just not gonna be a part of this at all?
Chris, I'm standing here in the living room because I need to talk to you about something very important.
It's my house, and I want to wear shoes in it.
You can either continue wearing shoes in the house or continue having sex with this age-defying Eastern physique.
Chris, I'm lying here listening to you toss and turn, and wondering if there's something you'd like to discuss.
I don't know. It's just, it's been so hard since Mom and Dad died and Joe moved in with all his big band records.
Chris, I'm lying here asking you to kick Joe out of the house.
What? He was my dad's best friend for 20 years.
If I give you back my Diet Sprite, can I leave?
I just don't like the people or what they're saying or doing.
If you could sum up the show with one sound, what would it be?
For me, it was more like the last squirt of a plastic mustard bottle.
No. I always bring one with me in case the show is kind of...
Well, if you're all so smart, what do you want to see in a Family Guy reboot?
Look, we're stuck being Fox. We have to deal with it, okay?
First of all, binge-worthy is not a word, it's a marketing tool.
All right, we only have the room till 6:00, so what else?
Eh, I'm gonna tweeze the Skittle out and go back in a week.
Great. Matter of fact, we filmed one back when I was an all-setup- no-punch-line comedian.
Yeah! Dane Cook already did all these halves of jokes.
I think that's just gay sex. Why are you telling me all this?
Pull over by this hot guy and let me out.
I thought I read you guys were phasing out gay jokes.
That quote was taken out of context and widely misunderstood.
I like the Olympics. Can you guys be the Olympics?
Well, NBC hogs all the good sports, so we'll get stuck with the boring ones that the announcers always have to keep apologizing for.
No. Guys, just so sorry that any of this is happening.
I-I mean, even once every four years seems like just way too much.
And they're up in the air, and now they're in the water.
Hey, guys, The Coffee Bean's Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.
It turns out the executive who ordered it was just a squirrel who snuck into the office.
Yes. But in fairness, it was the same squirrel who green-lit Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the show that challenged the notion that only attractive people can be on television.
It means Family Guy is just fine as it is.
You know what, I'm glad, after all that, they let us keep the show the way it was.
She loves to smoke and feels it's not truly a meal unless you serve bread.
Well, you know how there's hardly any cat cafés in town?
It's like a coffee shop, except one where lots of cats live and roam.
Hmm, methinks the cat café sounds like a great idea.
I also didn't bring one of them laser guns from Ghostbusters.
Good. We'll keep him till we get a new mayor.
Principal Shepherd, we were so surprised to get your call.
They had the Lost Boys of the Sudan standing in for them in gym class.
And it's like, if I had nine lives, maybe I'd finally find a man.
After what happened today with Meg and Chris at school,
I sent an e-mail to my sister, and five minutes later,
Yeah, the world's better now that corporations read our most private communications and then sell back at us the very things they've eavesdropped about.
Even before this, I'd worried about our church attendance dropping off.
Now with the kids showing a complete lack of morals, well, we may all need to go to Christian family camp.
Lois, you know I love you like a brother, but I'm not doing that.
I'd only get in an awkward, campfire-crackle argument with a counselor.
Uh, actually, what Jesus has is the might of Western civilization.
I happen to own this place. It's a cat café.
Now get out of here. You're making all my cats angry.
Fine. But I am about to become your worst nightmare.
Well, first, I'm driving through a forest, but it's actually inside, which is weird, right?
And there's all these people in the van who normally wouldn't know each other in real life: my second grade teacher, my mom, Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.
All the kids are yelling at me in German, and I understood them, but I don't speak German.
Then SNL is starting, and I'm clearly in the cast, and I haven't been to any of the rehearsals, and all the cue cards are blank, and that show is all cue cards.
Okay, Peter, the kids and I are off to church camp.
Well, then, how you gonna make any friends at camp?
Now chug all this next to a lake, you little rascal.
City ordinance 321 states, Food or drink shall not be prepared or consumed within
And as long as Brian's got your attention, is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?
I'm taking shorter poops but with longer wipes, and there's always this one little line.
I swear to God, it's like there's a crayon down there.
Wikipedia states that Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease spread by exposure to infected cat feces.
They also ring you up on one of those tablets they flip around at you and then glare while you pick from three inflated tip percentages.
But fine, if it's a fight you want, you got one.
But, Dad, we want to see what happens at Christian camp.
Yes, the fresh air really helps clear your mind of thoughts of Tom Selleck.
It's even worse than when Dad sent us to 1940s comedy school.
Clever news pun, doesn't really work as I haven't yet mentioned the subject of the story... At Quahog's new cat café.
Tom, I'm standing here outside of Quahog's new cat café.
Local resident Brian Griffin has described the café as a threat to public health.
I'm gonna talk a little too loud, and then occasionally I'm gonna turn away
Okay, Brian, I brought everything we need: water, sunscreen, Fruit Roll-Ups,
Stewie, you know you're not allowed to have Fruit Roll-Ups.
Oh, this is what Princess Diana wore to protest land mines.
It's sad she's not around to watch her son go bald.
Based on the various public health concerns you raised, the city has decided to shut this establishment down.
Until the Board of Health gives the okay, you're done.
We've hardly done anything together since we made that fiber commercial and had to use code words for pooping.
Just two spoonfuls a day to stay regular and active.
Cut to the shot of them stirring the product into water!
Remember, history says that Jesus does not look like a traditional man from the Middle East, but rather someone who sells raw milk online.
I'd like to move on to having you all sign your contracts with God.
Yep. It's a written commitment to forgo all alcohol, drugs and self-pleasure.
Now that that cat café is gone, I can finally get back to my favorite bar and do some writing.
Well, apparently, due to some recent public health concerns, the city has said that no animals of any kind are allowed in any public establishment.
Well, that's all right, Brian. We can go to my writing spot.
I figured anyone living alone with 73 cats needs to have a double-XL Minnie Mouse sweatshirt.
Well, that's good. I haven't seen you at the Clam.
You want to just take a look in the fridge, see what I got?
Nothing. I'm just sitting here, trying to figure out why we have stupid purple couches.
Have you ever known anyone in your life to own a purple couch?
What if there was a way for you to go out? Emotional support animal?
Wear this, every place will have to let you in.
The vest is from when I worked at Office Depot.
You don't work in an office you can steal this from?
Mom, we don't really have to get baptized, do we?
No, Meg, just hang towards the back of the line.
Y-You'd have no way of knowing this, but I'm actually having a very good hair day.
When my hair gets wet, I tend to look like a frazzled Sandra Bullock from one of her comedies.
So I said, That shirt looks really good on you, and he says, Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me.
It's like, whoa, all I said was I like the shirt, and he has to drop boyfriend like a nuclear bomb?
Ugh, you're supposed to be giving me emotional support right now.
No, no, Brian, say something nice about me right now.
It is now. Say something nice about me or I'll disappear like a serial killer in a '90s movie.
Oh, crap, another one died. Hey, hey, stop eating her!
Uh, how's it going? I got a dead cat on a pitchfork!
I don't even know which can to put it in!
You know, Vera, I've been so moved by my time here at camp, I wonder if I could perhaps say grace tonight?
Well, I'd like to begin with a moment of silence.
And the first one to open their eyes is gay.
Totally. I will say, though, it seemed like Chris enjoyed himself there.
Well, Meg, you know Chris is a little bit dumb, and I know you're not particularly popular or beautiful, but you do have a head on your shoulders.
So religion isn't gonna be for people like you and me.
You! You son of a bitch! This is all your fault!
Here, let me mend you, like in a 1990s action movie.
Well... honestly, I just thought that maybe I could put something good in the world for a change.
I've always been about sex and seducing women, but you know what?
I just thought if I created something that makes people happy, maybe people would remember me for that.
Hey, does anyone know what's going on with my brown crayon?
Because it disappeared from the box for a while, and now it's back.
I'm not a crayon scientist, but it looks like it's seen some heat.
The city repealed a law prohibiting animals from public businesses today.
Well, I'm glad you get to go out in public again, Brian.
I'm glad you, Chris, and Meg are back from that Christian camp.
Oh, she was so mad I dragged her to Christian camp, she ran away to live with a Japanese family.
Good evening, Quahog. Our top story: a local Yankee fan's dream comes true when he's diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
This is the story of the greatest trilogy ever told,
Dad, why don't you tell us how you and Mom fell in love and got married?
Well, it was the 1990s, the decade of Viagra but also Lorena Bobbitt, so it was kind of a yay-boo period for penises.
After graduating, your mom and me moved to the city with all our friends.
We were the kind of friends who were all good-looking, except for David Schwimmer.
And your mom lived across the hall with her friends Bonnie and... uh, Bonnie.
God, we desperately need to get more female characters in this show.
Not because of my sarcastic zingers but because I liked to take 40 Vicodin a day.
I know, right? You know how I always felt like I was stuck in second gear?
I just swung my arms and tried to fit in.
It was senseless. We were in our clothes, for God's sake. Everyone got wet.
It was cold. You know, there were originally nine friends, but three of 'em died of pneumonia.
I'm still haunted by Chad's shivering last words, Don't let Monica get Botox.
We also hung out at our favorite café, Perk Place, where we would all sweat like crazy
'cause everyone in the '90s wore turtlenecks, vests, and Jamiroquai hats.
Brad Pitt broke up with me in a pretty public way.
Wait, I thought you and Dad dated in high school.
Your father and I had dated for a few years, but I didn't know if it was going anywhere.
So we decided to take a break but remained close friends.
My father had planned out my whole life for me.
She went on to become one of the CDs in the garage.
Chris, I'm not sure you have the green light to just chime in whenever.
Lois, let's go take a midnight swim at Sharkbite Cove.
But the '90s was an exciting time, and we wanted to experience all it had to offer.
Hey, guys, there's a great concert in World Trade Center Plaza this weekend!
Korn is last. Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.
Well, I'm glad you agree with me, Quagmire, but that still doesn't address this issue of the order.
What band did we see last time at the Palladium?
Let's transition with a '90s guitar sting that's way too long.
I would sometimes sneak away to the Internet to go flirt with your mom.
Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs with my pinky in front of the mirror.
Peter, quit trying to flirt with that clearly girlfriend of yours and come watch giant box TV with us!
We all watched The X-Files, which would be Fox's last hit show.
And it was the heyday of the multi-camera sitcom, and Paul Reiser, its king, was must-see.
Which is, like, the sound of being lifted by a boner, I think.
Yeah, but we decided we wanted to see other people.
That's only 'cause she got tired of waiting around for you.
Look, she loves you, but she ain't gonna wait around forever.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
So I saved my money, and, a few months later,
What do you think of that, fellow '90s star Joey Lawrence?
Okay, well, what would you think if I told you that Blossom would completely drop out of show business to get a PhD in neuroscience and then come back and make $15 million a year, while you would work steadily for 20 years, lose all your hair and go bankrupt?
Sorry, I was just watching some guy take it in the AOL.
Well, deep down, I knew I loved your father, but I guess I just caved to my father's pressure.
And on my 28th birthday, he introduced me to my future husband.
President Clinton sent me a congratulatory cigar, but it's a little moist.
So I decided I was gonna do the most powerful thing you could do in the '90s: make a mixtape.
Again, Peter, it's your mixtape, but you've got Cotton Eye Joe as song number two, number four, seven and eight.
Oh, Peter, I got to say, the fourth and fifth time I heard Cotton Eye Joe, it really got to me.
I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.
I'm going to pay for Peter's bachelor party at the MTV Beach House.
And I promise it's not part of a ruse to destroy your affection for Peter once and for all.
Not only was Carter letting me marry Lois, but this was gonna be the ultimate bachelor party.
The MTV Beach House was located in the most hepatitis-rich part of Florida, known as Florida.
We partied the same way everyone in the '90s did, spaced apart by a few feet, dancing on our own.
There were these other idiots there having a bachelor party, but I didn't know 'em. They were losers.
Yeah, get out of my story. What the hell are you doing?
I'm telling the story of my days at the MTV Beach House.
Mark McGrath, Pauly Shore and Jamie Kennedy, and we became friends.
Then we can all enter the 2000s together as friends.
Yeah, we have to stay back here in the '90s.
I planned to, but then I found a half-eaten hot dog that only had a little bit of sand on it.
You can pretty much wash a hot dog with soap and water, and you can still eat it.
I danced for eight hours straight on The Grind, occasionally going into the pool to pee.
Also, for some reason, I was the only guy a bee was following the whole time.
Maybe it was 'cause of the Country Time Lemonade powder
I'd been eating, or 'cause me and Quagmire were huckin' Capri Suns at each other.
But little did I know, while I was dancing and periodically peeing in the pool,
Carter was orchestrating a plan to destroy my relationship with your mom once and for all.
Hey, there. You're all that and a bag of chips.
Oh. We're having fun 'cause it's not 9/11 yet. Mmm.
I was home doing what girls did at the time...
I took your father's mixtape and hucked it into the ocean.
Right then and there, I vowed I would never see him again.
Well, Magic Johnson got AIDS, and I was like, What?!
But then, he came back the next season and scored 30 points in a game where no one would touch him.
And thank you to the entire Brown family, whose last name escapes me at the moment.
We were two ambitious young entrepreneurs at the height of the dot-com bubble.
Moments late, we'd found a business idea destined to change the tech world forever: Googoogle.
A search engine for all the info on the Goo Goo Dolls.
We rented office space, and watching it gave us the idea to rent office space.
Uh, clearly, we hadn't discussed the, uh, tone of our work environment.
I thought this was to be a place of business.
We got over our initial differences, and then spent the rest of the day doing what everybody did in the '90s...
One guy does what he's told all the time and makes millions.
But a girl goes off, tries to be different, gets AIDS, and dies!
Meanwhile, my wedding plans with Tom Tucker were back on.
Are you ready? I can't believe the wedding is just two scenes away.
I guess I'm just not sure if I'm doing the right thing.
Trust me, you're doing the right thing. It's gonna be great.
Now, listen, we don't have too much time before the wedding, so I want to go over something regarding the father-daughter dance.
Daddy, I don't think The Macarena is the best father-daughter dance.
We celebrated in grand dot-com bubble fashion: by having an outrageous yacht party with lobster fights and hookers.
We did Ecstasy, which was terrible for you, and only ever made me feel fantastic.
They said it would burn a hole in your brain,
If you hate pure, unconditional love and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe, definitely do not try this drug.
There's also, like, a 90% chance you'll hook up, but really, no, don't do it.
Yeah. I never heard of him before he died, but when he died, it was so sad.
Somehow, all this success feels meaningless, knowing I'm about to lose her forever.
Peter, then you need to stop that wedding before it's too late.
So I decided to get there the way everyone got around in the '90s...
Do you, Lois Commondenominator Pewterschmidt, accept this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Before you marry Tom, what's the Mortal Kombat blood code?
I know I screwed up, and I don't deserve you, but I can't stop thinking about you, day and night.
I fell in love with you then, and I'll never stop.
No daughter of mine is going to marry a cheater!
I was in love with you, too, but then you cheated on me.
I only did it to protect you from making a huge mistake!
Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome as the guys your dad wants for you, but I love you more than all of 'em put together.
That's a fact. Just as sure as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy, unmarred by additional canon.
- One by one, members of Lois' family tried to stop me, but I laid 'em out.
There's something about punching someone in a church that just feels good.
I was driving my innocent friend O.J. and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico.
We eloped at Fenway Park, which I paid 50 grand to rent out the day before the dot-com bubble burst.
I got swindled on the Fenway deal because there was a game that night.
I was having serious regrets about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg, so there was no backing out.
Wow, Mom and Dad. I feel like I learned so much tonight.
And not just about you guys, but also about the '90s.
Oh, there's a lot more to learn about the '90, Meg.
Like, for instance, are you familiar with a band called Counting Crows?
I think I might have heard them in a Starbucks.
Anyway, their lead singer is this thing called Adam Duritz.
He looks like if Marc Maron had sex with a scarecrow and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.
I always thought he looked like the Cowardly Lion in a suburban white high school production of The Wiz.
But actually, the joke's on us, because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept with a primo roster of '90s tail.
Lois and I are stocking up for a very special anniversary evening, and I'm not sure that five percent discount was worth checking in here on Facebook.
Anyway, to celebrate, we thought it would be fun to recount the three greatest love stories ever told.
We'll begin with the tale of Helen of Troy: The face that launched a thousand ships.
Which is the poetic way of saying, Helen of Troy was thicc, tho.
Which is the Black Twitter way of saying, She was very attractive.
The people of Troy's chocolate has gotten into our peanut butter.
The people of Greece's peanut butter has gotten all over our chocolate!
We could perhaps try the combined taste, or we could fight to the death.
Guys, stop! The Battle of the Greece's Peanut Butter Cup has gone on too long.
Huh, what a pleasantly de-escalating phrase that I'm just now hearing for the first time.
The war between the Greeks and the Trojans is over!
Now let's go call a bunch of jagged rocks a beach.
Yeah, I'm just gonna plop down with my kids and watch Troy Story.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Helen's in my cabin, and I thought I'd give heterosexual sex a try.
But first, in tragedy news: your queen, Helen, has run off with Paris back to Troy.
I'll send my entire army after them, led by my best warriors!
We're going to get her back and burn Troy to the ground.
I just need to cancel my lesson with Socrates first.
Isn't he that thinker they keep shuffling around from one philosophy school district to the next?
No, no, he's the one whose method is all about asking questions.
Have you ever tried wine? Can you keep a secret? You know this is your fault, right?
Yeah, he'll... he'll make you question a lot about yourself.
So, we'll sail directly east, and then head north at a 90 degree angle.
It's the fastest possible way I can imagine getting there.
If we know this distance and this distance, we can calculate this more direct route.
I bet Greeks will always be known for their advancements in math and not as cartoon characters with very hairy arms and a tragically mismanaged economy.
Okay, I had a feeling this fortress would be impenetrable, so I've hired the finest builder in Greece to make us a giant wooden horse.
We'll hide inside it, they'll take it in as a gift, and then we spring out and destroy the city.
Well, that sounds great, but there's another door right here that's just beads.
Oh, boy, this... this is gonna be a difficult phone call.
It says Helen and Paris went back to the Greek Isles to get married...
And all three of Helen's fathers are going to be there?!
Awesome! And now that we're owned by Disney, we can have Hercules here.
Welcome back. My credit card got declined at the sex store.
We ran off with only the stuff we could keister.
Our next love story is Romeo and Juliet, a 500-year-old tale about horny preteens that society somehow decided is classy and not perverted, even though two middle schoolers bang in it. Enjoy.
Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona where we lay our scene.
If they find out we're Montagues, they might razz us!
We got inch-wide masks over just our eyes, with the rest of our faces plainly visible.
You're a grown woman now, and it's time for you to get married.
Now, I found you the most eligible bachelor in all of Italy.
He's from the Boyardee family. Kind of a big deal.
My family makes the best canned sugar pastas in all the land.
I'm in the midst of a full-on, lockdown sodium headache.
Now, fair Juliet, let our houses join together, like beef... and roni.
Some greaseball at the bar just drew a guy in a circle.
I-I meant... I'm Abe Froman, the sausage king of Chicago.
Yes, I'm looking for Abe Froman, the sausage king of Chicago.
Romeo, name something you might say to a damned spot.
I know I ain't supposed to be here, but I just had to see you again.
Juliet, I know we just met, but when I look at you, I feel something special.
This is gonna sound crazy, but... will you marry me?
Well, I wish you would have told me that before, but that's okay, because I do karate outside against no one.
I could never say this when I was alive, but... Ralph... Fiennes.
I'm voiding my bowels right now because I died, not 30 minutes ago in the carriage on the way here.
Oh, Friar Laurence, are you absolutely sure faking my death with this poison is the best plan?
And I think you, specifically, would make a great addition to our team.
A-And since I'm picking up a prescription, can I, uh, pay for the rest of my items here?
You can tell by her shallow breathing and weak but clear heartbeat.
And on top of that, it's that time in late summer before football starts and there's no basketball.
Did you think I was dead just because I faked my own death?!
Well, a boy I knew for three days is dead.
And on top of that, WNBA season is over, and it's still two months till figure skating starts!
For never was a story of more Oh, no! than that of Juliet and her Romeo.
I accidentally farted on a candle at our Eyes Wide Shut party and this happened.
Man, is this a great black toilet loft party or what?
Would you like to dance in silence, because they always add the music in post?
Now, let's have hot sex in silence, and they'll add the sensuous music in post.
Yeah. It's hard not to root for a rich, white lawyer in the Connecticut suburbs.
Leave a message for our intact family after the beep.
Now I'm giving you a minute to pick up the phone hastily.
I got it, I got it, I got it! Hello?
Judge Forrest.: How did you get this number when they deliver a book that has all the numbers?
Dan, look over to the split screen and see how crazy I look.
I'm listening to opera, but I don't know which one,
And one other thing: the baby will not be ignored by you, Dan.
Listen, just call your wife on your numbers-on-the-top car phone, and it'll all be better.
If I were you, Dan, I'd just go home and enjoy your family and rabbit.
Well, time to wash dishes while looking at a lawn, like most housewives.
I better warily approach that pot in silence, knowing they'll add dramatic music in post.
I got something to tell you in front of our kid.
I know. It was awesome at the time, and, frankly, I was real close to getting away with it.
My plan was to just hide this from you forever.
Well, when a man and a woman like each other just a little and they get in an elevator...
But I will say, at least she had a pot of something on the stove when I came home.
Well, now to defog this mirror and see only myself.
Now to fully close the mirror and have no changes.
I'm gonna do to you what I did to your bunny and your neighbor's cat because I went to the wrong house the first time.
Huh. Wonder if the weather called for living room rain.
Next up, Connecticut, your living room forecast: dry, dry, dry.
You deserve to die, because the choices I made are your fault!
Let's just sit on the floor with our backs to the tub.
But they did say they'd give me one minute at the end of the show to share my favorite love story.
Of course, I chose the classic romantic tale of the love between a young man and pastry,
The store was all out of apple, so this one is chicken pot, fresh from the oven.
Coming this winter: actors who don't look familiar in shows you're pretty sure you've never heard of on networks you've definitely never heard of.
First, it's The Marriage Man on Geego Audience Prime Plus.
And don't forget The J. Tory Hampton Show on Traxx.
Turn your office watercooler into a modern-day Tower of Babel.
You know how I've been dieting like a maniac the last couple weeks?
I just got off the phone with my mom, and all the Pewterschmidts are coming here for Thanksgiving.
I just need you to go to the market and get some extra napkins.
A-And put the extra leaf in the dining room table.
Yeah, right. That table ain't been opened in five years.
It'll be fine. Just don't drink while you do it.
And for God's sake, don't lose your temper with Chris.
This stuff is the only thing stopping you from getting so karate-chopped right now.
'Cause if you hear any argument from anybody who says it isn't stuck, you send them to me, and I will so karate-chop them in the face!
Last year I spent Thanksgiving with my old blow-up sex dolls.
You know, sometimes I envy the guys in the town jail.
They get a turkey dinner on Quahog and don't have the hassle of hosting their families.
Jail is just a sleeping deputy with keys that can be grabbed by a long broom handle or a mischievous dog.
Well, maybe going to jail is what we should do.
We'll commit a small crime and get put in jail for a couple days.
Okay, if we want to get arrested, the best way to do it is to get caught on the Ring app stealing people's packages.
I don't know exactly what this is, but this... this is crime.
I was raised entirely by our mother, he by our father.
You guys think you're the first ones to have this idea?
The jail's already full of dads getting out of Thanksgiving.
Well, if we're not going to Quahog jail, where are we going?
The only place where there's room for the weekend: the state penitentiary.
You used your one call on this party photo booth guy.
We're in here, and everyone on Wall Street is free as a bird.
Joe, now is not the time for your bland political musings.
This sucks. The courts are closed for Thanksgiving, which means we can't even go before a judge till Monday.
Maybe we just got to make the best of it.
And that guy in the back definitely has to get up higher.
Joe, you should be more terrified than any of us.
You know that old sitcom premise where the kid has two dates to the prom?
You've never heard of Kal Penn's pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?
How could I possibly have heard of Kal Penn's pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?
Well, I do get a yen every now and then
To pick up a pen, like my pal Kal Penn
And a note I will send every now and again
To my pal Big Ben who is locked in the pen
'Cause he beat up some men and he got five to ten
Kid, I know talent and shooting waitresses in the mouth, and you've got talent.
And whatever happens, let's make sure we're not goaded into fights by simple playground taunts.
Mad Dog, next time, I'm asking for the top bunk.
And God knows what else they're gonna do to us.
We have three more days here, and we're not gonna survive three more minutes.
Yeah, when you're in a gang, no one will mess with you.
So, how do we get into one of these gangs?
Man, getting in a gang is gonna be harder than I thought.
We want fun. We want upbeat. And for our dance, we want You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift.
So... so, what I need is someone I can work with.
There you guys are. I haven't seen you all day.
Me and the Not Cops were watching Die Hard and not commenting on the believability of the police work.
Could John McClane really foil a giant heist outside his jurisdiction, then just walk away and do zero paperwork?
I am now Cleveland J. Roman J. Israel, and I will be wearing wine-colored suits.
Well, in his defense, the movie was set in the '70s, wasn't it?
Well, let's just say in prison, this guy comes off.
As the new white guy in prison, you have to shiv the new black guy.
But I don't want to die. And it would be nice to have people to go to Smash Mouth concerts with.
Come on, there's got to be a way you'll let me in the gang without shivving Cleveland.
Ooh, ooh, I got an idea. There was this prison movie, and-and there was this guy who wanted to win over the other prisoners, and you know what he did?
So, you bring me seven or some other reasonable amount of eggs...
Yeah. Before this, I was in the USC directors program.
You think you're learning about film, but, really, you're getting a degree in politics.
So political. Best advice I ever got: whatever business you think you work in, you really work in sales.
We thought it might be fun to kick things off with a game of Heads Up!
You just hold this up to your head, and then we're gonna give you clues to help you guess it.
It's about seven castaways. There's a professor a-and a millionaire a-and a movie star.
Don't forget, he's the one who told you all those Schoolhouse Rock! Spoilers.
I had no idea that bill would become a law.
My gang said I wasn't really loco unless I shivved someone, and you're the one guy without gang protection, so...
As a Not Cop, I have to shiv a guy in the Latin gang and then blame it on Cleve...
Fighting in here amongst ourselves while Brooks is out there waiting for all of us, bagging groceries, adapting to this new world seamlessly...
The point is, in life, you need to be thankful for what you have.
I just wish she was here so I could tell her I'm sorry.
Not now, prison ladyboy who talks like my wife to please me sexually.
Chris got caught watching cousin Katie pee, so that kind of ended things.
And the truth is, Peter, we're not a family without you.
Same thing it always was, babe: a dream we both wanted to believe.
The important thing is, my days of selfishness and red-wig twinks are over.
Hi, I'm the warden and definitely not a psychotic prisoner who just stabbed the warden and stole his clothes.
By the rules of prison and The Love Boat, you've made up, which means you get to leave wiser and happier.
Well, we're certainly glad to have you home, Peter, but I hope you learned your lesson.
I got to make a license plate for our car
But I took off a T and the E at the end.
And now, Adam West High School Choir's original Christmas song, Die Hard.
Yes, the movie was originally released in summer, but it took place on Christmas Eve, which makes it a Christmas film.
H-Hey, have you guys seen that mom who wears a swimsuit for a bra?
Meg, there's a lot I have to get done here, so I need you to take Stewie to the mall to meet Santa.
Now, why don't you go warm up the car for your little brother?
Oh, look, there's all the Jewish kids sitting on the rabbi's lap, where he asks them for something.
I want a new TV, and it can't be a Vizio.
And I need it all set up before I turn it on.
I don't want to have to do any of the things!
Ugh. Some people push their kids to do stuff way too soon.
Is it okay if I just hold him for the picture?
Here you go, Stewie. Santa's no one to be scared of.
He's kind and warm. He loves unconditionally, and... and he makes... everyone feel so... so...
You look like Mom when she sits on the washing machine.
Okay. She had six well-done hamburger patties jammed into a hard taco shell.
Okay. I mean, I can get it for you, but it's a weird order.
It all happened so quick, but I really feel something.
The windows are steamed up like when Subway's making the bread.
Good. Now get back to making sandwiches with the shiniest turkey on earth!
I mean, Santa Claus was bouncing us on his knee.
And it got a little faster, then faster, and the more he bounced, the bigger Meg's eyes got.
I can't tell you explicitly, since we're owned by Disney, but let me just say that
Brian, would you hand me the Fat Man's fancy puking hat?
Now, there's my hat. Kids, I'm off to the opera.
And worst of all, I didn't even get to ask Santa for the Vitamix.
Stewie. I'm gonna take you back to the mall to sit on Santa's lap.
How did she find me? That's my best hiding spot. No!
Oh, and by the way, Rupert, after what I saw,
I don't make much money, and Christmas is very expensive.
Dad? I'm gonna ask you one question, and how you answer it will determine the rest of my life.
Is there really a weight limit for the escalator, or did I just meet some mean kids?
Some stockbrokers are gonna throw me into a gong later.
Lady, I've been thrown head first into so many gongs,
I think he was just a temp. I'd try the Warwick Mall.
My uncle who moved to the Idaho wilderness says Hitler was a great man.
That's the guy that was peeing in the women's bathroom.
Stewie, when this is over, I'm buying you a new toy.
Meg, when this is over, I'm putting rocks in my pockets and walking into the mall fountain.
One reason I work as a seasonal elf is I'm not great at time estimates.
Even a broken clock is right six times a day.
He's very scared, so I have to sit here with him.
No. L-Last night, I was weeping outside my ex-wife's apartment.
I drank too much and went over to yell at her.
They said my Santa would be here, and you're not him.
Excuse me, ma'am, I'm gonna give you just 600 minutes
Lady, by the power vested in me by Paul Blart, you are now banned from this mall and every mall in this county.
So, you want to tell me why you were assaulting Santa in front of the whole mall?
He just bounced me on his lap, and the next thing you know,
It's your first time, followed by a lifetime of diminishing returns.
I can't let Stewie grow up scared of Santa Claus.
Like, anybody can just come through my window at any time?
I just wanted to tell you that everything is fine.
Meg is entering probably the most horny part of her life.
This could just as easily have happened while she was riding a horse or something.
Stewie, that Christmas magic you think you lost, it can't just disappear.
Eh, he's okay. I just... I just want a new one.
Maybe you can spend more time with the old one
I had a hell of a time finding your room.
So, you want to talk about this whole Santa's lap thing?
Dad, this stuff, I-I think it's gonna be hard for you to hear.
Oh, don't worry, Meg. I brought this handkerchief to dab my forehead whenever you say something sexual.
I better loudly drop an Alka-Seltzer in this glass of water.
I-I may need to widen my eyes until they look like a young girl's Snapchat filter.
You know, I played football for Coach Joe Paterno at Penn State.
All right, team, remember everything you learned in practice this week and forget everything after practice this week.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I've got to get in there.
Mall Quiet on the Western Front closed 900 minutes ago.
Do you have a big cup I can pee in for my ride home?
Geez, I'm trying to give you a heartwarming message of Christmas joy.
You know, the same feeling you got when you were five and I gave you that Malibu Barbie?
I try to visit every mall at least once during Christmas.
I can't believe I, you know, grew up all over you.
It's okay, Meg. You see, I know what each and every person needs for Christmas.
For you, it was your first time seeing Jimmy Connors.
But the truth is, it had nothing to do with me.
And as long as you believe, it'll always be with you.
Well, I'm off to distribute presents to boys and girls all over the world.
All right, I'm gonna put my leg up on this back tire and take a she-wee.
You know, you don't have to say everything out loud, Meg.
I'm totally real, so don't tell anyone about this and don't say anything to anyone.
Yeah, it's tough being a teenager, dealing with all these new emotions and feelings and streaming platforms.
I remember when I was your age, I was confused, too.
Then I got a haircut that I'd keep for 50 years.
You've just got to find your one thing that works.
But just in case, here. I want you to have these.
Whenever you need me, just rub my balls, and I'll come.
I'm not sure we should be letting Stewie watch this.
No, no, Peter. It's just Chris practicing his new recorder.
Yeah, you can't just play one note over and over.
Well, our music teacher quit and was replaced by a back-East bird.
Well, I'm gonna have to talk to Principal Shepherd about this.
Great. Every kid loves seeing their mom inside their high school.
I'm sorry, but music is an important part of your education.
You don't want to mess this up, like Skee-Io messed up his wishes.
Uh, I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller,
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat.
Sorry. I was just testing these... candles for a... lie I can't... think of right now.
I'm a trained piano player, and I've taught lessons for years.
I'm gonna be the new music teacher at Adam West High.
Turns out, if you're gonna learn how to stop time in wizard school, don't leave class early to be the first in line for lunch.
And you'd think it's got to be pretty good pizza, being made by a magic wand and whatnot.
I don't think it was the usual guy making it.
I'm your new music teacher, Mrs. Griffin, and I started from the bottom. Now I'm here.
Okay, Deaf Larry, we know music is nothing to you and never will be.
Headstrong, full of anger, and a body that looked like it stepped right out of Redbook magazine.
Okay, okay, I didn't know where the troublemaker was gonna sit.
Mr. Mason may have been a bird, but at least he wasn't a liar.
Well, you better get used to me, 'cause Mr. Mason's gone.
Well, I hope this doesn't affect our plan to have eggs.
I didn't leave my family to have sex with a 12-year-old boy named Vili Fualaau, get arrested for rape, give birth to his child in prison, get out, get arrested again for humping him in a car when he was 13, have his second kid in jail, get out, get married to him, change my name to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau, live my life as a disgraced sex offender, and then get dumped by him.
But I did have a little trouble in Meg's class because of that brat Connie D'Amico.
Lois, I'll take my dessert upstairs in the masturbation bathroom.
Maybe I'm not cut out to teach high school kids.
I thought I could handle their nonsense, but I just kind of froze today with Connie.
You just have to be more of an authority figure.
If Connie gets out of line again, don't be afraid to show her who's boss.
Um, so, not a huge deal, but if you guys could keep your chittering down,
I'm trying to get some writing done in the house.
Also, maybe you could go (BLEEP) your own face, huh?
I followed you into your cutaway because I didn't believe you showed anyone who's boss.
I know some of you kids think this class has nothing to do with your day-to-day lives, but you couldn't be more wrong.
I woke up and saw it was a sunny day.
On my way out the door, the kitty cat ran across my piano.
But then, I hit some traffic... that was caused by a parade.
And finally, I got to school early and diarrhea'd in the girls' locker room.
Okay. For the rest of the class, I will wait for the bell.
And then I will suddenly talk much louder and faster as you're heading out the door.
Okay, and remember, there's a quiz a week from Wednesday!
Connie, I've asked Mrs. Griffin to be here since it was her class you disrupted.
And I'm sorry to say, this is your third strike this year.
Yeah, maybe because I'm awesome, and you're a gay homosexual, and also the word Jet Ski a lot?
Ugh. I feel kind of bad about getting Connie expelled.
But maybe this'll make her realize she needs to be more respectful to others.
Hey, Lois, I just got an invite for a Facebook group you started called Keep Harriet Tubman Off the 20-Dollar Bill.
Wow. Your profile pic is now just the word veterans with a circle and a line through it.
I mean, that's the way I feel about ghosts, but veterans?
By the way, Vili Fualaau is now a DJ in Seattle.
Yes, I wish to buy business and turn into car wash.
Okay, well, if you're so fine with it, what are you doing Friday night?
I'll keep this on the D.I. Hughley, but your next date should be with Christ.
I've just been so distracted with this whole Connie thing.
So, Connie made you mistake a monster's face for the words Oral-B.
Well, if she's really ruining your life, go down to the station and talk to Joe.
Yeah, I thought of that, but I hate competing with the sound of ringing phones and typewriter keys.
Fine! I knew this would be a waste of time!
I'm gonna go see what new stuff they're turning into milk.
Hey, that woman has all the Viva brand paper towels.
E-Excuse me, miss, could I have one of those Viva brand paper towel rolls?
I need them all for the big mess you've made.
Hey, Lois, do we need any jeans milk at home?
I need it to pat down bacon and let Meg suck the wad.
I didn't mean to get you expelled, but now I'm glad I did.
At least I'll have a paper towel with the power to take on any spill.
Ah, darn it. I couldn't open my camera in time.
Well, I didn't hear what you just said, but what's the dinner situation?
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, transitioning into my sad voice for the death of a white girl.
Local white girl Connie D'Amico died at the scene of an automobile accident earlier tonight, the brake lines of Connie's Celica apparently cut.
Can you imagine being the shovel that gets to scrape that ass off the road?
I'm gonna have to take you down to the station.
We've got you on grocery store video threatening Connie D'Amico.
So, what, I'm supposed to be a guy without a wife now?
What am I supposed to do, whatever I want whenever I want?
Who's gonna slap a tarantula of shampoo hair on the wall of the shower?
Who's gonna fill up my DVR with lady judge programs?
Oh, and I suppose now I'll have to start every road trip
What am I supposed to do? Masturbate comfortably in bed?
And I guess I'm gonna have to be on time to every party
Yeah, I was right here when you were doing that.
That's right. And the best way to crack any high-profile crime case is to do a podcast before you have all the facts.
And the key to any podcast is poor sound quality and tons of commercials.
You bet, Lois. My first question is... do you get a good night's sleep?
No, 'cause I'm in prison, and my cellmate is bipolar.
Well, if you get a Casper mattress now, you have a hundred days to decide if it's the right mattress for you.
That's why I wear MeUndies. Perfect underwear for hanging yourself in your jail cell.
Can we talk about the case? I have 30 seconds before they haul me off to the freaking cafeteria.
Have you ever wanted to receive a vegetable in the mail?
Ziprecruiter: We vastly overestimate how many podcast listeners are in a position to hire someone.
Okay, Brian, let's go through Lois's drawers and look for clues. If you find any, let me know.
And if you find the yo-yo she took from me, definitely let me know.
The Wendy's employee gave it to me if I promised to calm down.
All I see here is your Nerf gun from last summer.
Doesn't matter. Everybody knows the way you solve a murder is to ask a barkeep if he knows anything.
When he says no, you turn around, and then he says wait and gives you an important clue.
One of the waitresses says you put her tip down her pants.
Huh. How long were you planning to sit on that little nugget?
We go around town and rip off faces until we find the real killer.
We found Connie an hour ago at a motel outside of town.
Turns out she put a pig in a blonde wig behind the wheel of her car.
Well, Lois, I got to say, it's great to have you home from prison.
Hey, I-I got to ask, are-are you gonna stay that jacked forever?
It-it was... it was nice being held up against a wall, but when you made me suck the hairdryer, I-I...
I enjoyed it, I did, but I-I don't want to do that specific thing again.
Well, that's too bad, 'cause I'm ready for round two.
Just got to make sure the kids don't come in.
Now no one can get in, and no one can get out.
Look at this, Brian. Genderless baby announcement. It's a they.
I think I've earned whatever misshapen Reese's product is by the cashier.
Remember last week when I said, I wonder whatever happened to Fairuza Balk?
The urine-soaked hairs on the end of your penis are very off-putting to the other customers.
It's just like what happened to those blacks at that Starbucks. Those blacks?
We do, and I can bring Planters peanuts that were opened a dozen years ago.
Perfect. And I have half a graduation cake we just have to let thaw.
That's the one thing men are allowed to control about women.
That and your uterus and how much money you make and also everything else.
The only woman that's ever looked good with short hair is Halle Berry's boobs.
We're here with local hero Brian Griffin, who recently foiled a robbery at Goldman's Pharmacy, which by the way, is getting its ass kicked by the CVS across the street.
So, what does it feel like to be a hero?
Well, let me say that even though I am a hero, you don't have to call me one.
I'm very comfortable with first responder or, if you like, veteran.
It hasn't. I'm still the same humble public servant I've always been.
And to show our appreciation, you get the first meal at Quahog's newest Sizzler location!
Well, I'll be at Barnes & Noble this afternoon signing copies of Deepak Chopra's
Coming up, I get all anxious and weird when the new good-looking intern brings me my coffee.
This is Barack Obama, not the hobo who lives at the wharf.
I know it's been a while, but I saw you on TV and I'm just hoping we could get together.
He sounds like a ski instructor with a full beard who plays average guitar and never texts me back.
He's a dog I used to run with back when I was living on the street.
He just drank all the time and tried to get laid.
You're angling your phone so I can't see it. Dwayne Johnson.
With my boobs and your hair, everybody's gonna think we're a lesbian couple.
We used to live here. I'm assuming he still does.
I was hanging on. I do all my own stunts.
I do a two-name thing. It's one more than Beyoncé.
Why don't you take her name out of your filthy whore mouth.
I'm a tech entrepreneur, I've written 11 best-selling books, and I was the NBC executive who suggested we assault the nation with Chicago-themed programming.
What's the deal with the South Side of this town?
So, Brian, do you want to know how I did all this?
Getting neutered eliminated all distractions and allowed me to focus solely on my work.
Sometimes you have to literally cut out the things that hold you back.
One minute, I got a hot ginger wife, and the next I'm married to Ron Weasley.
Donna wears a wig, so I've never even seen her real hair.
But I would imagine it looks like an old, faded sweater that needs to be de-pilled.
Well, since Lois did something to her appearance that you don't like, you should do something to your appearance that she doesn't like.
I'm gonna make myself harder to ignore than an amateur photographer.
So I'm sitting in my office at work when the fire alarm goes off...
I'm gonna write an inspirational book about my life, and I'm calling it
Or you could watch Blue Bloods and have a pudding cup.
Oh, my God, Peter, what the hell are you wearing?
No. You look like you're going to a custody hearing in Florida.
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna add this free Fandango golf visor I got when I snuck in to see I Feel Pretty.
Wow. That was the coolest phone call I've ever heard.
You know, I wish I could spend more time with you today, but I'm late for a video conference with
I was thinking about what you said the other day, and...
I've always believed I was destined for a life like yours, but something was holding me back, and now I realize it was two things.
I'll finally be able to beat that guy who fights dirty in my karate class.
Yes, but how much do you really know about him?
Look, Stewie, this is a huge step for me, and if you can't support me, well, then maybe I should cut you out of my life, too.
Did someone die? Do I get to go home early?
I thought it might be fun to come by and sell some of my homemade jewelry to your coworkers during lunch.
Once a guy's wife sells something in the break room, no one ever looks at him the same.
Two years ago, Bentley's wife made him hang a sign-up sheet to sponsor her in an AIDS walk, and we've hated him ever since.
Well, Peter, all you have to do is say you like my haircut, and I'll leave.
I took a jewelry-making class last month with a group of preschool moms, and now I'm gonna do it as a career.
But presumably there were people who had AIDS at the walk?
Oh, God, Peter, please put that thing in the garage and change your clothes.
I'm doing it because of the mean seventh graders who have been chucking footballs at me all day.
Oh, Stewie, you're gonna make me spit out my saltwater taffy.
Stewie, I've got to have you around here more often.
Nothing is where it's been for the past 17 years.
I'm gonna make one political donation with your e-mail address so you'll be screwed for life.
I'm gonna start a podcast that has no focus and it'll take up an inordinate amount of time.
Every time a waiter tells me their name, I'm gonna use it.
I'm gonna get really into Halloween, like, really into it!
Gross. I'm gonna wear a denim shirt with the Looney Tunes guys embroidered on it to church every Sunday.
What did I do to you that was so bad?
Then the minute Peter Griffin came along, you just got in his car and left me.
I was gonna come back and get you, and-and then, and then Trump happened and-and all that...
I've wanted to cut your balls off for years, but the fact that you're choosing to do it yourself is so much more satisfying.
I read his book. There is no greater motivation than the destruction of an enemy, and my enemy is Brian Griffin. One day, I will convince him to cut off his own balls, and that will be my greatest accomplishment.
You said his books changed your life, but you didn't even read them.
But did you ever think that you should be thanking me?
Your hatred for me is what motivated you your whole life.
You'll probably keep it in a trophy case or something.
Well, the good news is we can give you a prosthetic.
The bad news is it's one of the bells from a jester's hat.
There's no brain activity, so we're gonna harvest his bells.
Why did the king have to hit him so hard?!
We now return to A Quiet Place, starring a Jewish family.
I'm finally all caught up on New Girl, if you guys want to talk about that.
Aw, come on. I want to get one more beer.
Sorry, Peter, I got to work early in the morning.
Lois'll see the charge. She thinks I'm still at work.
You don't have your own card, one that Lois doesn't know about?
This is where I get all my credit card bills sent to and any other mail Donna would be mad about.
Knives with gemstones, fat-butt magazines, whatever you think Ice-T would keep in a nightstand.
Peter, I'm telling you, get yourself a secret credit card.
Ah, this is gonna make my life so much better.
No way. Guys, you are looking at the owner of his own credit card.
Anyway, they even want me to do one of Tina Fey's look how quirky and busy I am credit card commercials.
Tell her I'll be there as soon as I can.
Do you know if that Mexican doctor takes credit cards?
If you're scummy and on the go, try the new Visa Gold Card.
Yes. I'd like one of those flashlights with a vagina in it, please?
I'm surprised this thing still works after the day we had.
I had that flashlight under my chin to look scary.
Peter, are you wearing a costume from Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country?
Sorry, Peter. New rule: I... I have to report any adults bragging about having a credit card.
You know what bothers me even more than all the money you put on that credit card?
Oh, I know. What, does she think she's a (BLEEP) teenager?
Wait, no, no. What's worse is finding out how much you lie to me.
Monday night you said you were working late, but there's a $62 charge at The Clam.
You said you had to work last weekend, then you bought a T-shirt that says Working weekends... Does not compute with Johnny 5 on it.
Yeah, but she's acting like everything's fine on Facebook so she can post pictures of food.
I mean, I've done some stupid stuff, but she's never grounded me before.
Well, you could just leave the house if you want.
They are people who pay for things but are still somehow burdens.
Worst part about it, I'm gonna miss my Sunday shift at Clappy's Birthday Restaurant.
Excuse me. My table is celebrating the birthday of deceased Hawaiian pop singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.
Peter, you're not gonna believe whose car just broke down on Spooner Street. Tom Brady!
- Yeah. He's throwing passes to anyone who's able to leave his house.
Oh, my God, Joe just stood up for a second.
He put that pass where only a walking person could catch it.
That's how good he is... His pass made me walk!
Aw. Lois? Can I please go out and play with Tom Brady?
Tom Brady's taking us all to see an Anne Hathaway movie.
Boy, my butt sure was like a match that needed to be extinguished that day.
All the Preparation... H I used on my fiery ring.
I don't care what color your belt is, you're a child and I am stronger than you.
Boo yourself. She was the one strutting around Pizza Hut with that trophy.
Yeah, who's the Girls' Regional Youth Karate Champ now, Kelsey?
We laid my Uncle Reggie to rest with the respect that he deserved.
I'm sorry we stuffed you in that Hefty Cinch Sak and pushed you in the pond.
You dug a hole all the way from your house?
Peter, there's some salmon on the stove if you're hungry.
All right, it's pretty neat, Peter, but we should probably get out of here.
Actually, Peter, there's elbow prints and knee prints all around this thing.
And there's scuffled dirt and a little bit of blood over here.
Peter, did you trip on a root and eat it big-time?
Uh, hang on. There's a guy tunneling the other way.
That guy was in the paper for hitting his wife.
Because you can't stand up to your wife, I'm gonna die.
What do you think happens when we run out of air, genius?
You know, I'd only taken the other three elements into account.
Who's that, Joey Swanson or Bill Nye the Science Guy?
Uh, what's standard protocol for when the cops start looking for us?
I just give out stickers if kids come to the station.
I guess the only chance we have is if Brian sells me out to Lois.
What I wouldn't give to be with a woman just one more time.
You can go over to that wall, make yourself a dirt-gina.
We now return to Planet Earth, with its original narrator, who was let go.
I'm worried he left the house and got into some kind of trouble.
Good. Because I'm not a bad boy. I'm a good boy.
How would you like to be a very good boy?
The fat man dug a tunnel to go hang out with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire?
Daddy went to a Peter Cetera concert in Cleveland with Robin Tunney?
Robin Tunney from The Mentalist slept with the entire Cleveland Browns team?
Bad Moms 1 and 2 are available on most streaming platforms?
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker, here with a story that's anchor out of the studio important.
Rescue attempts are underway to free four men who have been trapped in an underground tunnel.
I ask that you please respect my privacy in this difficult time.
You don't think it's because we're running out of air?
That's a nice thing to say to a lifelong friend.
Let's not use the rest of our oxygen to kill each other.
So if we're all gonna die anyway, what's the worst thing you guys have ever done?
Well, I, uh... I, uh, went to a Coldplay concert by myself.
They were playing in Boston, so I made the trip.
I said Kid 'n Play on the phone, but they didn't understand me, so I got Coldplay.
One other time I said Kid 'n Play and I got Cirque du Soleil.
I hope the rest of the tunnel isn't about to collapse.
So, uh, full disclosure, the last time I did this, the guy got torn in half.
Probably won't happen again, but they want me to say it.
All right, whatever we do, we're not gonna talk about kissing practice.
We've been doing kissing practice and I'm the best at it.
Can you take off your shirt and come up in just pants?
I just want to be the one you come to
Peter, the whole reason you were grounded was because you were lying to me.
I know I was acting stupid, and I deserved to be grounded.
I lie to you 'cause you treat me like a kid.
Act like a man and I'll stop treating you like a kid.
Look like a kid, I'll start acting like a man.
Yeah, you know what, Tom, I think we're all gonna go home and charge our laptops a little longer tonight.
You just never know when you're gonna run out of juice and have to use your phone.
You know, just because we're reporters doesn't mean we're devoid of emotion.
Nothing but the best for my beautiful bride on her honeymoon.
I'm sorry, sir, the chef said he can't make a chocolate chip gumball pizza.
Sir, you need to get ready for your lifetime achievement award ceremony.
What if I told you you could accumulate all the wealth you'd ever want simply by learning the secrets of real estate?
And then what if you could use that wealth to turn yourself into a Broadway star?
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen and 14 other genders we have now.
I'm Lane Bergan, the biggest star of May 2020 and on.
So, if you've only watched TV up until April of 2020, my name would be unfamiliar to you.
When the Dwayne Johnson Center for Confusing Ethnicity approached me about hosting this night,
When Stewie invented the Wipeless Dump, our rainforests were hanging on by a thread.
It's so wonderful to be here with all of you.
When I heard I was going to be receiving this award, I...
I'm not the person who yells at waiters, but maybe everyone bussing tables can freeze?
I-I don't understand why I'm the person who has to be saying this, okay?
This award means the world to... me... and I want to thank... everyone who...
Anybody with a (BLEEP) bowtie on, stop what you're doing, walk into the coatroom, and don't come out until I'm done talking!
I'm now going to stop mid-sentence because I see someone from my...
Wow, so you, uh, really went all-in with the Japanese screens.
Yes, I really like changing in silhouette while carrying on a conversation.
But let's continue this while I take a very foggy shower.
And you haven't even told me how great I look.
Aren't you going to say anything about the cute name I gave it?
I snuck it in your food because I wanted you to live long enough to see that global warming is bull crap.
Yes, and now thanks to you, we're stuck with President Polar Bear.
President Polar Bear, is it true you ate the presidential seal?
President Polar Bear, what did you do for a Klondike bar?
I believe the president has answered all of your questions.
Why did you even want me to live this long if you were just gonna leave me?
Mom and Dad always wanted me to be someone I wasn't.
You want to tell me what you're doing with your hands here?
And what does the greeting at the top of the card say? Merry Christmas and a Shocking New Year.
And what is every other member of the family doing with their hands?
I could care less what you do with the pink, truly.
You know, he once asked me in the event that he was sick to clear his Google history. Peter Griffin search history. Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh jacket, Winnie the Pooh vintage jacket, Winnie the Pooh letterman jacket, Winnie the Pooh windbreaker, Eeyore jacket, Eeyore vintage jacket, Eeyore letterman jacket, lactating pregnant Latinas...
Okay, getting back in there. Full cast Winnie the Pooh backpack.
Oh, cancer symptoms, yeah. Coughing up blood, pain in abdomen,
Yeah, he is sick. You know, while we're here, let's take a look at your search history.
What a weird thing to try to impress me with.
Especially after Grandpa died and left me the dark boathouse.
You can still use the boathouse on non-vacation Sundays in the spring.
Send Chris off to do this, send Chris off to do that.
I'm your older brother, Stewie, and I was stepped over!
Yeah, I kind of wasted my life, except I obsessed over teaching my penis how to talk.
I'm getting to it, if-if you'll give me a second.
Hey, numbskull, that's how we got in trouble the last time.
She runs a small private security business out in the desert.
I'm starting to think my call is not important to them.
We don't give a crap about you, but we're the cheapest,
Oh, I want to fly standby to Pittsburgh, but I also want to host The Muppet Show.
You know what? Cut over to Brady on Brady and then take the Brady Bridge.
The only book is just a label ripped off a Muscle Milk bottle.
And look, there's the Robert Kraft Marina, full of tugboats.
I wouldn't do that. Since you left, the New England accent has become incomprehensible.
I-I just, I just want to know where the Quahog Harbor is.
Uh-oh, there's a lot of guys in Bruins hats turning around now.
Christopher Irish or Italian name, are you causing trouble out there?
Yeah, I'm basically exactly the same, except I pretty much only talk about ice cream now.
You know there's three different ice cream shops in Quahog?
You know, there are three ice cream parlors in town.
Oh, I can't complain. Little hard of hearing, which is why I turned on the closed captioning.
Your father's had severe diabetes ever since they opened three ice cream stores in town.
You can't live like this, the house is falling apart.
Oh, Pop, I am so sorry I abandoned you all.
Just promise, when I die, that you will help our family.
All right, now that that's settled, let's celebrate with some of the music of now with closed captioning.
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker, delivering the news with my Andy Rooney end-of-life eyebrows.
You won't hear anything I'm saying because they're so distracting.
Now, let's go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, so we can be shocked at how well her people age. Tricia?
Tom, I'm standing here with flawless skin next to the shedding, crumbling, dusty ancient relics of white people my age.
Oh, Stewie, you've done so much to help our family.
Aw, and thanks for these virtual reality glasses, so I can watch porn while talking to the family.
Play the song, but play it slow because I am old.
No, this is actually just the ones who did our show right before they died. Crazy, right?
Dad, you don't have to do this, there are too many.
No, we won't cry for him, we will celebrate his life.
The finest cigars for the finest family ever to live.
And I love you, which is why I must not delay any longer.
I must get my affairs in order and transfer my money to all of you.
I feel like we're in The Sting, that movie from 100 years ago about 150 years ago.
Thanks. Well, you know, I credit my years as a writer.
When I planned the con, I saw Quahog as a character...
Of course I knew the whole thing was a scam.
They probably did that crying turning into laughing thing when I left, what a bunch of hacks.
They're too stupid to notice I snuck into the kitchen and turned up the gas before I left.
Ooh, wish I could, but the pills were in the house, so, yeah...
What the hell is wrong with you? You've been staring at that old man Halloween costume for 30 minutes. but it's a big decision.
You know, I've always been afraid of being old, but now I think I'll like it just fine.
Turns out this costume is about 80% balls, and most of it's dragging behind me.
I have heard your cries, and I just want to say...
You're gonna be the back half of Edgar the Farting Horse.
I can't believe Daddy actually bought a Minor League Baseball team.
It's where you bring all your trash and you leave it for someone else to deal with.
Here, help me get this Christmas tree out of the back.
So, what do you think of your first tailgate, Stewie?
I'm gonna mention that to my teacher, and it's gonna be a big problem.
There's free food, a bar, and you can drop a plastic spider on a string
I'm your announcer, Johnny Feedback Robinson, here to tell you about all the...
Hey, Griffin, you want to be a Minor League Baseball coach?
Oh, man, I haven't been this excited since I met Cool Hand Luke.
He plays by his own rules, and women respond to that.
Check this out. Hey, baby. You're looking fine. Mmm. Oh, yeah.
You mind if I get in on that? Oh, yeah. Mmm. Just FYI,
I'm either gonna finish too quick or not at all.
All right, Griffin, that cutaway convinced me that you are, in fact, sure of this.
Now get down in that dugout and do your job, Coach.
I won't let you down, or my name's not Peter Little Bingo Griffin.
Ducks on the pond. Some of 'em brown, some of 'em prettier... All of 'em ducks.
Peter, do you really have to wear those in the house?
Meg, can I, um... can I see you in my office, please?
This is really the toughest part of the business, isn't it?
You've been very professional as a family member, but... here's the thing...
We just need a bleep, a bloop, a walk, a balk, another balk, and, of course, a little bingo.
Okay, now pull his shirt over his head and waterboard him with the Gatorade.
Little bingo. Ducks on the pond, furry ducks, little man in a boat.
If you can find it, you're a better man than I am.
I can't believe the Quahog Whooping Scalpers are actually going to the playoffs this year.
All right, it's time for me to Oakley-load for tonight's game.
Okay. Forehead Oakleys, round-the-neck Oakleys, brim-of-the-cap Oakleys, back-of-the-head Oakleys, tucked-into-my-shirt-collar Oakleys,
Everglades fan boat Oakleys, and Ray-Bans for my eyes, because Oakleys are terrible.
All right, it's Bucket-O-Shrimp Night, brought to you by Rocco's Lukewarm Refrigerator Trucks.
That child's beach toy full of gray baseball stadium shellfish isn't sitting right for some reason.
Maybe I should smoke a cigarette for the first time ever.
Okay, not a fix for now but definitely something I immediately want to keep doing.
Probably best to just add something hot and acidic to the mix.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I think I have to go to the bathroom, sir.
Must... sit in a way... that pinches my sphincter... shut.
Looks like Coach Peter Griffin is taking a knee during your national anthem.
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, joined tonight by a very special guest,
Channel Five's own Tom Tucker Senior, who hasn't been on the air since 1964.
More and more women are choosing to work outside the home.
Our top story tonight, local baseball coach Peter Griffin took a knee during the national anthem today, joining the fight for equalit.
You're on the news for taking a knee during the anthem.
Because you took a knee to support the fight against police brutality.
I'm just a white guy doing what black people were already doing.
Well, can I just say, as the famed family liberal,
Doesn't matter if it's me or, say, you who gets applauded for his progressive thinking, as long as the message is out there.
Not at all. As long as the message gets out there.
Hey, did you ever notice he has the names Doc and Marty in his name?
A-Are you sure you're not just exploiting a real social issue so that people can call you a hero?
We now return to Seinfeld, which keeps getting edited down more and more for syndication.
Drinks are on me tonight, thanks to your boy Peter.
I get all kinds of respect now. Check it out.
Peter, that's just a barstool with a fur coat draped over it.
That's a trash can with a moldy pumpkin on top.
Yeah, so many liberals patted me on the back today that I lost my glasses.
I need to yell at people who are just trying to buy milk on their way home from work.
Do you have a minute to save a child's life?
Tell me why Smokey the Bear wears jeans but no shirt.
Oh, well, I'm a part of the national conversation now, and I voted.
You know what? This whole activism thing has gone on long enough.
You knelt at one game. It's not like opportunity's gonna come knocking on the door, offering you money for it.
Mr. Griffin, we heard about your protest and we no-heartedly believe that, with your help, we can conflate buying our products with genuine activism.
And now we want to give you a lot of money to star in a commercial for us.
How do you know what's inside you unless you test yourself?
Don't have one family, have a second family all the way across the country.
Don't just have a second family, have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle.
Don't spend any time with the first two families, make a commitment to family number three, and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party.
'cause, remember, you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for.
Don't just let Kenneth walk out of your life, take his life from him.
Don't just go to jail, go to death row by killing the two other families.
Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing, send a message that you're not afraid of hell.
You may not know this, but our full name is Nichael.
Okay, I'm ready to move on to the next person.
Peter, ever since you made that stupid commercial, my ticket sales have tanked!
Thanks to you, people now think the Quahog Whooping Scalpers are racist!
Two strikes, two outs, bottom of the ninth, down by one, bases loaded, Pewterschmidt up.
He grounded out in the second, struck out in the fifth.
This entire episode would have been our season five premiere.
Well, this is WaQuahog, a secret part of Quahog with technology more advanced than any nation.
We brought you here to help you after you were attacked for your activism.
Really? So I'm the only white guy who knows WaQuahog exists?
Oh. I don't, uh, I don't see a soda with that.
Pretty sure the tip is already built into the service charge.
Wow! So this is, like, a secret kingdom cut off from the rest of the world?
Yeah, that's not really working out, but thanks for having me here, guys.
By taking a knee, you showed the world that you see the terrible injustices our people face.
Of course, being an activist, you already know all about them.
This is more uncomfortable than sports announcers in a too-small booth.
So, the Cowboys come in to today's game winners of four of their last five.
So, Troy, what do they need to do to beat this Eagles team today?
Well, Joe, you and I were talking over chopped liver and coffee this morning, and we said it has to start with the run game.
I remember after that we Lady-and-the-Tramp'd a croissant together and said this O-line needs to get healthy.
That's right, Joe. And I hope the viewers out there can see by the fact that our lips are almost touching that we are truly excited about today's matchup.
We do hope you'll join us in protest by kneeling at the next game.
Peter, everyone has to find out what Migos are for themselves.
Front row seats... thanks for having me at the game.
Pleased to meet you, Kevin. I've got some seats for you
Hey, what do you say we take a pit stop in the... little boys' room.
And now, please rise for our national anthem to be sung by Kevin Nealon.
And I have no idea how he convinced me of that.
I didn't kneel during the anthem because I was an activist.
I kneeled because I had fairly brutal diarrhea, and I'm sorry.
If I could take it back, I would still kneel, but for the right reasons now.
I see the struggle you face, and you deserve everyone's support.
And, Carter, I know you're just trying to honor the troops.
But, honestly, why are we even playing the national anthem at a sports event?
It's not a solemn occasion, like a military funeral or, or sex between Salma Hayek and Ed Norton.
The problem isn't with each other, it's with the song.
We need a new song, one that unites all people.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you your new national anthem.
Well, I'm glad all that controversy is over and we got our old Peter back.
Oh, yeah, that's right. She got traded to American Dad.
And then there's a fish and a boy and a girl...
What's up, fellas? What can I get you guys tonight?
I'll have just, like, a... a chicken salad or something.
Hey, uh, Jerome, can you give us a minute to discuss this as a group?
Why the heck are you not drinkin', for cripes' sake?
Are you doing the keto diet so you lose a bunch of weight and it makes you look like you got a mascot head?
Like so early you still hear people outside mowing their lawns.
But it's not that bad... Th-there's plenty of sober stuff
That's stupid, or is it? I'm in. I have a kite in my car.
If we can't drink, we might as well lock ourselves in a room with no windows.
For those of you who've never played before, the game is simple.
You will all be locked in identical rooms where you will solve a series of puzzles using clues hidden around the room.
Yes, I look like a man who owns domestic rats.
Yes, this current talk is being videotaped and will be used as my legal release of responsibility if aforementioned toe-eating rats were to nibble, bite or maul any of the present participants' toes.
Yes, this is the odd speech cited in our Yelp reviews.
You guys want to bet on who finishes first? Huh?
; Well, I... I don't know if we should be betting.
Uh, A client needs your help. His name is in the address book in your desk, but you can't find the key. Try looking in the last place you left them.
Okay, where do people leave their keys when they come into a room?
Oh, oh, I know, I know. In the corner of the room,
I'll just yank on the desk drawer until it opens.
Everything on Groupon is just a trick to Get Out black people.
All right, the name in the address book is Anthony Fibonacci.
The missing numbers are what we need to unlock the keypad on the door.
Look at those idiots. Their thought process always involves food or cultural stereotypes.
Fibonacci is also a reference to a sequence of numbers where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
It's from The Da Vinci Code, and the answer is 2-3-5-
Fibonacci is the name of a number man from The Da Vinci Code, which was written by Tom Hanks, so the number is...
Yes! That is why you bring a dog with you everywhere you go.
Even in Target, 'cause who's gonna tell you you can't?
Hey, Stewie, we really crushed it last night in that escape room, huh?
Ugh, don't say crushed like you're trying to sell me a Range Rover.
I should just let you enjoy your superior intellect while you still have it.
Oh. Did you think you were the only smart baby in this family?
Chris and Meg were just as smart as you were.
But once a Griffin hits puberty, they turn into a full-blown bozo.
Well, the good news is, since you do a sex advice podcast...
Which I really like, by the way... every time you... it's a write-off.
This is my new invention: a gene-altering device, or GAD.
I thought about what you said yesterday about me growing up stupid.
I can't control the DNA I was given, but now I can control the DNA I want to keep.
It's going to change the world, just like James Taylor changed rock and roll.
Are you ready to watch me play guitar on a stool?
All right, I've put in all my desired genetic modifications.
Stewie, I'm serious. Messing around with your DNA could have dire consequences.
Yeah, no, and take that Citizen Kane tone out of your voice.
Shut up! I timed it to go off when I...
I think taking out that DNA turned you into a regular baby.
Hey, Chris, watch. I bet she orders the eggplant parmesan like it's something fancy.
Ha! Our family should wear uniforms with Basic Bitches across the front.
Yeah, he was. He said we're a bunch of basic bitches.
Brian, if I was such a basic bitch, would I be wearing solid black umpire's shoes?
Where the hell is my white wine with Sprite in it?!
Hi again. That man over there reading a book by himself has offered to pay for your meal if you move to a table outside.
You're paying for their meal, so you can't be the dick.
Brian, I need your help with Stewie on the flight.
You see, when young kids act out, what they're really doing is asking to be heard.
They have very little control in their lives, so the key, and I mean key... is to make them an active participant in these decisions.
And once you do that... you'll see... a big... difference.
Hi. Can I get some of those tiny square napkins?
Now the bride and groom would like to share a moment of silence to honor the family members who have passed.
They may not be with us in person, but they are with us in spirit.
But as far as I'm concerned, you've lost the bubbles.
As much as I hated being around a condescending baby,
I prefer that to a screaming bag of leaking crap.
These are all just sketches of Stewie with different Hemsworth haircuts.
Here. Restore original DNA profile. Yes. Would you like to add a Hemsworth haircut? No. Are you sure? Yes. Really? Yes. Would you like to first see a photo of what you're turning down? No. Too bad.
Just like how Sylvester Stallone needs help getting ready in the morning.
So, do you think you can help me get him back to normal?
Go to the kitchen and grab eight to ten dish towels.
Tear 'em in half and lay 'em on the floor in my room.
After that, go to Shake Shack and pick up four burgers.
Finally, I need you to sew the long plastic tube from the vacuum cleaner
I can fix this, but not if you don't trust me.
I know that there's got to be a part of you inside there that can understand me, and maybe Rupert can help you remember.
Remember Rupert? He's your best friend with whom you seem to have a very sexual past.
His preschool teacher said he took home the Flat Stanley this weekend, and she needs it back.
Everything is fine. Just nobody come in or look in.
I wish I could go back to before this whole thing happened and tell him he's right.
Removing those parts of your DNA doesn't make you smarter.
I know, but I may not have been telling you the truth about Chris being a smart baby.
So you're saying that somehow, all my smooshed-together, crappy Griffin DNA is actually what makes me smart?
Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do.
For everything to revert back to normal, you have to drown your past self in the toilet.
Well, that was fun, but it didn't fill the whole episode.
So, in the Pixar tradition of killing time, here's a Family Guy short.
And don't worry, it won't be that creepy one where the Chinese mother eats her baby.
Ah. Nothing like drive time radio to remind me that I don't make enough to afford satellite radio.
Hey-hey! You're listening to WQHG 97.1, and we are Devin and Lawrence, formerly known as Weenie and The Butt.
Those nicknames no longer fly ever since several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against each of us.
And don't forget, Quahog is expected to experience record-high temperatures this week, according to our respected meteorologist
I can't. I spilled honey on it and it won't move.
No. I don't start drinking till... until the drive home.
Man, I can't believe that cop thought I was lying.
The only time I lie is when I play poker.
Ooh, he's not looking at much of anything right now. And those mirrored sunglasses, not doing him any favors.
Okay, you two just hang out in the store while I return this keyboard.
I'm going to watch the older boys play Fortnite, because I'm not old enough to play Fortnite myself.
Well, it said it was designed for writers, but when I sat down to work, it just wasn't flowing through me.
Do you have the credit card you used to pay for it?
Manager who's dishearteningly younger than me to the service counter, please.
Well, we can probably throw out this sunflower butter now that Stewie's classmate with the peanut allergy died.
Oh, there you are, Peter. Listen, I need you to...
Once it gets going, you can't just turn it around.
So until the weather cools off, you're gonna be dealing with a slippery walrus.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I see a potential rival to my beach supremacy.
Now that I sweat all the time, it's just natural that I be a very sweaty bomb defuser.
All you gotta do is remember the song you learned in bomb school.
We now return to Indiana Jones and the Temple Beth Shalom.
I've been asked to be an overly sweaty Southern lawyer during a landmark civil rights case.
May it please the court, Your Honor, opposing counsel, members of the jury,
Snack Cart Steve, elderly widows with paper fans, woman in the third row with a flower hat,
Yay Radley, Herman Munster judge, lazy dog who wandered in due to the heat, crazed Al Pacino, old Robert Duvall, young Robert Duvall, in-between Robert Duvall, the books of John Grisham.
We now return to Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone in Opposite Eye Sizes.
Sorry, guys. All I have left are one pair of extra-large contact lenses and one pair of extra-small.
Well, I just got off the phone with the electronics store.
Well, I'm not very good at math. Y-You lost me.
Yeah, do you expect all nine of us to chip in?
Come on, we got to think of some way to raise that money in a hurry.
The shameless film star who made a movie college kids used to like is again asking people who have less to give him more.
That's it! We'll set up a Kickstarter for the three grand we need.
We'll raise the money we need, pay back the store, and then e-mail the backers, saying we ran into trouble and couldn't finish the project.
Great idea, Brian. Much better than that version of Free Solo narrated by a concerned Midwestern mom.
Now, now, why wouldn't you just have a nice lunch at Applebee's?
Damn it, Griffin, you've become a liability in this office.
'Cause I use office petty cash to have sex with high-end escorts?
I'm afraid you're going to have to work from home
So, Mom, you're okay with Dad working in the house
You see, Mom, we try to stay focused on the task at hand here at Griffin, Griffin, Griffin, Griffin and Griffin.
Huh. I thought our letterhead had five Griffins on it, Meg.
But you were right to leave one of them off, because you're (BLEEP) fired.
Hey, Lois. I'm at the small bodega in the living room lobby trying to pick out a new baby card for Janine.
Yeah, right? Anyway, should I get one with a baby with SpaghettiOs on his head, like, This is what it's gonna be like, or one with a stork with an injured back?
Well, time to live out my dream of becoming a bodega cat.
Again, I want to say I'm so glad all of our schedules lined up so we can work together. And, as a reminder, we've got New York on the line.
Stewie, is there anyone specific on the line in New York?
New York, I'm gonna put you on hold for a second.
All right, let's show them the pitch video we put together.
I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.
My father made holes in belts, and my mother was the Italian guy on a pizza box.
The old man wanted me to go into the family business.
Don't make me beat you with the instrument with which I make holes in belts!
Six months later, my old man died when they canceled The Tony Danza Show.
Anyway, all that is why I want to make a movie about a dog who joins a hockey team.
Now, Lois, you have been accused of an unwanted touching.
Now, the way this works is we simply gather information and I make up my mind an hour ago.
I'm sitting there at my desk, trying to watch porn on sites you guys haven't figured out yet, and she comes in and kisses me.
Now, Barbara, the reason you are here at Super HR is there's been an accusation of unwanted touching and an overly sexualized work environment.
Mr. Griffin, those chips were recalled in the '90s for causing explosive diarrhea.
I also want to ask a question without looking at the screen.
Gentlemen, it's time to start inappropriately touching actresses on the casting couch.
All right. Dishes washed, kids off to school, taking my boobs out of my bra.
I just stepped off a bird from Omaha, and I have a very tight window.
Well, I'm gonna have to circle back with Ken to get it past the goal line.
Unless, Wendy, do you want to run it up the flagpole?
Well, at the end of the day, it is what it is.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but when push comes to shove, look, listen, look.
I got to go crowd the gate so people think I'm in first class, even though I'm in boarding group seven.
Peter, for God's sake, can I not just have 15 minutes of peace and quiet in my own kitchen?
I will simply do my work and not say a word.
Attention, please, we are gonna begin pre-boarding Flight 238 to Scottsdale, beginning with our first-class and Prestige members.
Scuse me, is there any way I can get on the plane now, even though I'm in the seat whose back touches the bathroom?
Okay, welcome to the first official table read for The Untitled Kickstarter Project.
Chris will be on speakerphone from down the hall, and, as a reminder, that may result in a five-second delay.
So, now to hand it over to our writer extraordinaire,
I would like to officially thank Stewie for spearheading this project, and I'd like to thank Chris for his help scouting all the locations.
Yeah, speaking of scouting, you sure got good at scouting the location of the nearest Burger King.
We open on a suburban home, where a party is in full swing.
Chris, we're having a little delay issue here, so try and come in a little sooner, yeah?
Okay. The teenage son stares at the man in the doorway,
All right? Okay, okay, Brian, here's what we're gonna do.
You're going to slap the table halfway through your line, and, Chris, when you hear the slap on your end, that's when you talk.
Okay. Uncle Cornelius stands in the doorway in stunned silence not knowing what to say but knowing he should say something.
Uncle Cornelius slaps the table in anger as he walks across to pour himself a gin and...
I'll return your pearl-handled revolver one bullet at a time!
I just want to thank... everyone for all their hard work today.
Well, since you decided to turn our house into an office,
I decided to make it into a public work space for everyone to enjoy.
We can put your logo on anything: a mug, a set of pens, a mug.
Funny you should say that, because our art department could whip you something up.
For instance, I also piped in easy listening music throughout the house.
Doo doo doo... Ode to My Family by the Cranberries?
Lois, you know once I hear that, I can't get it out of my head.
I got a Square here, so we can take care of the transaction in-house.
Well, we could bring that down to $29.99, but you'd have to buy 4,000 of them.
Fruit Baskets Covered in Cellophane. How may I help you?
I was just thinking about another part of my day.
Everyone out in the hot sun for an hour, with no information as to when we're coming back!
Huh. Maybe you'd be better off working from your office.
But I thought you'd like having me around the house all day.
But maybe it was too much of a good thing.
You know I love you, but if this marriage is gonna survive,
I think you need to be gone for most of it.
I guess you're right. When you look at it, most marriages are just a couple hours a night.
I'm sorry I was getting on your nerves, being home so much.
I'll call Bert and ask him if I can come back to the office.
Hey, I went ahead and ordered those 4,000 penis mugs for you.
And we even had $300,000 left over to buy snacks. M-Movie snacks are very expensive is, is-is the joke.
It's called: Everybody give me an idea what time you're leaving.
Hey, is the party good out there? Can I come out?
Is there food on the floor? I can clean it up!
Joe just dropped a cracker. Joe just dropped a cracker!
Well, since this is a nice cocktail party, let's talk about books.
I only read four books in my life, and three of them were about Johnny Bench.
I ain't ever read a book in my entire life.
Damn it! I shopped at Trader Joe's for this fancy cocktail party, and once again, your ignorance of books has ruined it.
I got a junior high book list here, and starting tomorrow, you are reading one of these books.
You better, 'cause this was more embarrassing than when we played truth or dare with present-day Madonna.
I'm just gonna put my backpack down for one second.
It's a lot easier than finding a man out there.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe wash your hair, lose the bun, give that a chance.
I am ready for you to be lame and a book and not something unexpected.
He left a note. If Van Halen calls, tell them they rule.
I did what you wanted. I went to the library and I got 1984.
Peter, I'm not okay with this new Van Halen phase of yours.
Like JFK deciding to cruise through Dallas in a rental.
And did you get all your stuff out of the car?
We've got a red station wagon blasting Panama and being awesome and partying and being rad.
Stickbutt, break off pursuit. Panama kicks too much ass and shreds way too hard.
Negative, Dispatch. Just need to wait for that Runnin' a little bit hot tonight part.
He's gonna time his jump for the greatest harmonized sound drop in '80s rock history.
I didn't want to play this card, Peter, but if you won't listen to me, listen to the pancake with slices of banana on it.
Don't you think I see the maple syrup tears, Lois?!
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the movin' parts clean
Hey, in case you need it, someone left this business card at the crash site.
Looks like there's a new squirrel in the insurance game.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but your husband is in a coma.
Yeah, I saw this guy playing at an H&M, and I got his number!
I mean, he's not responding to my advances, so it's either a coma, or he's a frigid bitch.
Talk about the good times, what he means to you.
Where am I? Hey, let me out. Let me out!
Peter Griffin, I hereby sentence you to an awkward apology dinner with Joaquin Phoenix.
Hey, if, uh, this goes south, is there a plan for Peter's rakes?
What did I tell you, Mom? What did I tell you?
Well, I just thought it would be one less thing to worry about later.
Your President Woodrow Wilson is giving the dedication right now.
Okay, I'm gonna try pulling my pants all the way down.
I can't go. Can't we just fill this up with a hose?
And how do they know I like being slowly beckoned?
Mrs. Griffin, I have some good news or some bad news depending on how you feel about your husband.
I'm afraid it's time for you to... make your choice.
What? A-Are you telling me I should pull the plug?
Also, you might be getting a call about the service you received here today.
I can't get anything less than a ten, so if there's a problem, you should tell me about it right now.
I may have to pull the plug on my husband.
I-It's two minutes for you. It's a job or not for me.
Senor Griffin, I think it's time for you to depart.
Terrible! My family tried to off me in my sleep.
There! I said it. You know what it's like being married to you?
Every day wondering if my husband's gonna die from something stupid?
Running into a tunnel that's not really a tunnel but just something the Road Runner painted on the side of a rock.
Honestly, I-I'm amazed you haven't died in some kind of Black Mirror techno nightmare by now.
I can make it up to you, I will. I promise.
I am gonna be more high-maintenance than a white woman on vacation.
Excuse me? Could I get towels? We need more towels.
Is someone available to take 20 to 40 pictures of me?
I want you to line up and give him one compliment about his Netflix show, the Santa Clarita Diet.
Hey, you tried to kill me. This is the logical consequence.
The comments have to exclusively relate to the Santa Clarita Diet, a show which aired three full seasons on Netflix.
It's over. You'll never forgive us for killing you at the hospital, so we're done.
And I definitely won't have any flashbacks of our happy times together to convince me otherwise.
And who am I? I'm a fly on the wall
Unless you got some kind of up-tempo rock music that's good for speeding to.
I-I thought maybe your father would show up at the last second and we'd have one of those airport scenes.
Well, that's a nice movie trope, Lois, but the post-9/11 reality is there's no way a nonticketed civilian can...
A bunch of people who try to kill each other.
And if I got to have my plug pulled by somebody,
And you're the only people whose plug I want to pull.
But I made the rules, so I went with it.
Well, we all learned an important lesson: no one should ever read a book.
I will as soon as I find out if he has a banned-from-the-Apple-Store podcast I can listen to.
Sorry. That was Tony, the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Well, this can't be Meg. She's with us here at the pier.
Now let's get back to the fair and enjoy our March 23.
Here ya are... Ladies' seven on the left, and men's 11 on the right.
Coming up, I find even more sand on my body from a beach toilet I used a week ago.
But first, tragedy strikes close to home, as a car crash near my apartment claims the life of a local teen girl.
The victim's identity is being withheld pending notification of the family.
What brings you around at this late hour with your uniform on and your hat held mournfully against your chest?
Peter, Lois, it pains me above the waist to tell you that Meg is dead.
You know, it's weird that didn't happen on the pier all day.
She got in a car wreck, and was burned beyond recognition, and I leveled up on Fortnite this weekend, but you probably only care about the first two things.
All we found was Meg's driver's license at the scene.
It had her Quiznos punch card stuck to the back.
Your little angel was one stamp away from a free sub, which only adds to this horrific tragedy.
It's actually pretty impressive, because the card was only issued three days ago.
Usually one of the guys would swipe a thing like this, use it on the way home, but I snagged it for ya.
Thought Meg's family ought to be the ones to enjoy the free sandwich.
She was burned beyond recognition but identified by her driver's license.
Wait. Did you give my ID to the wrong girl?
Sorry. Them shoe spray fumes made me all goofy in my head.
Again, for those of you in a new scene: Meg Griffin dead.
I hope the priest pulls me up on stage and dances with me.
When I was hastily relocated to this parish a week ago, the last thing I thought I'd have to do is stand before you on such a sad occasion.
A family losing a child is like a Trivial Pursuit wheel losing a pie piece.
And you have to keep reminding everyone playing the game, Don't forget. I already got 'Entertainment'. What a pain.
Meg Griffin was an honest man, a kind man, a man who knew how...
If there's anything we can do to help you during your time of need...
Wow. Are girls coming on to me because my sister died?
No, but at this point, I know what you're thinking.
I'm off to a new town to start a new life.
Don't you know what a rosary on a doorknob means?!
Before we eat, would anyone like to say something about Meg?
Okay, I feel all of you looking at me, so here goes.
I hope that you're with Bubba, and I want you to know that Lieutenant Dan is walking around...
Yeah. We're gonna save a lot of money on toilet paper.
She'd wrap up both hands like oven mitts and act like she was cleaning out a pot of burnt chili.
Maybe we should just have a moment of silence as we hear the guy down the street scream at his barking dog.
I just thought I'd come by and see if I could borrow a cup of tampons.
Sure. Just bring 'em back when you're done. No rush.
You want to join us on the roof and sit under string lights?
Because Natalie Hallway doesn't need to sit on a hemorrhoid donut.
You know, Stewie, when Meg was little, we used to love to make Christmas cookies together.
Could we get some of your cookies for our wedding?
In the case of Kent and Bradley v. Holiday Dongs, the court rules that you must give us the recipe.
Under court order, Stewie went on to make baked goods for the gay wedding.
And because of that, he did not get into heaven, just like they've always been saying.
Hey, Chris, I couldn't help but notice how much attention you're getting.
Chris, here are the keys to the drivers ed car to use anytime you want.
If I were using the drivers ed car for my real car,
Chris, if you're heading home, can I get a ride?
Wow, Natalie Hallway, how did you get so good at bowling?
Oh, I used to play a lot back in Qua... rea.
So was that before or after you were one of the first black women to do math for NASA?
Hey, Griffin, I heard you scored with the girls' basketball team yesterday.
So you suddenly got sick of your new, great life?
I'm glad you're alive, but you should know things are different now.
He mumbled something about the Wi-Fi, then ate a whole chicken on the couch,
Sorry, Meg, but I can't let you come home just yet.
Yeah, what was that? I thought something flew into the van.
No, that's, like, the universal signal for move it out.
Well, then how do you know when it's time to head out?
Sorry, I got distracted by all this whappin' the side of the van business.
Damn it, Chris, I don't care that you're popular now.
And two, to find the owner of this X-Men water bottle someone left in wood shop... Does anyone recognize it?
I'm not gonna tell you which character's on it, you have to be able to tell me the character.
But now, here to help you mourn, an artist who specializes in sensitive music to do finger stuff to,
He's one of those has to be supported by both elbows mourners.
If you haven't won a championship since 1982, just take the banner down.
Well, Meg, looks like you really are dead this time.
They say your life flashes before your eyes when you die.
Now let's see, if I whap my forehead against this cement floor enough times,
I think I can create a blood luge to slide myself out on.
I think we can all agree that John is entitled to take whichever student he wishes home with him tonight.
And finally, the Quiznos across the street has graciously taken out a full page ad in the yearbook that will feature a dedication page to Meg.
Come on, in the back, you guys have been great.
All right, everyone throw confetti and ruin the janitor's weekend.
This is our last chance to get laid before Janitor College!
And I think if Meg were here today, she'd be the first one to agree.
Damn it, I'm giving a speech! I want to tell you...
Yeah, Meg, I'm just really glad this whole ordeal is over.
You faked your death, I fake orgasms and being impressed by my husband's accomplishments at work.
Hey, Lois, guess who got to erase the white board in a meeting today?
Like orgasms or pretending to like your wife's egg salad.
And anyway, I give it to that raccoon outside who likes me.
Like orgasms or pretending to like people who give you egg salad.
So, what kind of Navy crime do we have today?
He's headed towards the Port of Washington, D.C., where our Navy is held.
We interrupt this program for an update on the weather.
Record rains continue as Hurricane Michael Caine has stalled over the Rhode Island coast.
Experts say Hurricane Michael Caine is 100 times more impressive than Hurricane Dean Cain, which just seems silly now.
Ah, well, at least we're all here, and we're all safe.
It's okay, Lois, I left him chained up in the gully in the backyard.
Let's all just go to the bathroom and pretend we can't hear each other go.
So, Chris, did you get back your Industrial Revolution term paper?
Hey, guys, the splatter on the floor was already here.
I used four of the five towels to clean it up.
Well, maybe there's something in this drawer we can all play with.
Boy, the last guy who stayed here was super cool.
And there's a book in here that makes you tired just by looking at it.
A book called T, written by Holly Bibble. Uh, Peter, I think that's the Holy Bible...
Is what Brian would say if he wasn't drowning in our backyard.
Seriously, could somebody else read this? In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth, and the sitcom joke that goes, 'That went well.' And the first man and woman, Adam and Eve.
I think the leaf over my balls is poison ivy.
Hey, while I got you, there's nothing to do down here.
When are you gonna invent the American Office on Netflix?
You know, I-I gave them water, the sun, a clear road map to hating gays.
Yeah, and there's still six billion things left to name.
What's the word for that thing flying through the sky?
Anyone mind if I open fragrant Doritos in a tiny room?
It smells like horse crap. What flavor is it? Cattle Ranch Doritos.
Relax, Lois. Family Guy has long been sponsored by Axe body spray.
There. Now we all smell like a nightmare Tinder date.
My girlfriend got a piece in an art show, and I'd look like a dick if I didn't go.
Did everyone who submitted to the art show get in?
I'll be nibbling terrible cheese cubes with Santa Fe people who couldn't cut it in the real world.
Well, I gotta go get yelled at for being late to something
I didn't want to go to in the first place.
No putting your penis in the gopher holes, and no apples.
No. He said if we eat the apple we're kicked out of paradise.
Why would I lie? I'm a snake in a tree.
I have nothing to gain from lying to you, aside from the minor sexual thrill of watching someone eat something.
Eat it with your feet, and look at me when you do it.
You created the most tempting thing man has ever known... a piece of fruit.
Well, the girls with either their brothers or their fathers, and the boys with either their sisters or their mothers.
Are we just gonna let that guy in the parking lot keep screaming at his girlfriend?
Shh, shh, shh. If we're quiet, you can hear every fifth word.
And again, you'll let me know if another older, heavyset woman wanders by in nothing but a T-shirt?
Now, here's a story about a bunch of animals who went on a cruise.
Wait a minute, are you just doing Bill Cosby bits?
Yeah, why not? All of his stuff is up for grabs.
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. Noah was feeding his children chocolate cake for breakfast.
If only those teachers had stones, then they could stone back.
I don't think the Founding Fathers ever envisioned stones this large.
I stopped taking my lithium, and I'm building an ark for God.
Michelob Ultra! To build the ark, Noah stole the wood from the front of his neighbor's house.
No, no, no, no, Noah! And the animals came, two by two, and were given poorly assigned rooms.
All right, uh, lions, you'll be with the baby antelopes.
Oh, good for you! Soon, the Great Flood came and the ark set sail. Then, like every father on a boat,
It's gotta be a reef knot. You call yourself a sailor?
I really don't. Why... Why would you go starboard if I said portside?
Look, why don't I tie the knots, you polish the teak. Can you do that?
Wait, you're gonna polish the teak on the windward side?
I ca... I can't... Is this... Is this guy for real?
All right? I left a Penthouse magazine for you in the aft cabin.
It's a real thing you can Google, it's really quite remarkable.
I'm sorry I threw the Monopoly board overboard on the third day.
Well, at least we still have The Game of Life.
All right, let's play Risk until it's clear I can't win.
Now let's divide it into banks and strips as one normally does with land. Shem and Ham married their mom, while she and Noah remained the best of friends. Noah even danced with Ham at his second marriage to his daughter. Shem and Ham had twins named Phlegm and Yam, who married each other and gave birth to Noah's next daughter-wife.
Now God only brings natural disasters to places that have too much butt stuff going on.
How about this laminated motel information sheet? Checkout is noon. Must dial nine to reach outside prostitute. In the event of fire, follow the older heavyset lady in just a T-shirt. There are no dining facilities on-site, but guests are encouraged to visit the Applebee's, which is a short walk across the six-lane highway.
Oh, God, I made eye contact with someone looking for shelter.
I had an umbrella, but as this is a comedy, you can imagine what happened to it.
There's nothing in here to eat but crackers and screw-top wine.
You know, that actually reminds me of another Bible story: The Last Supper. It was the week before Easter, and Jesus and Mary Magdalene were dyeing eggs with that cheap messy coloring kit from the drugstore that has those weird paper things that are like costumes for the eggs but never really fit around the eggs...
The half-orange, half-red one is mine, so don't eat it.
Oh. Sorry, I got that big supper with the guys tonight.
Somebody'd have to nail me to a piece of wood and throw me in a cave grave.
And if one guy isn't there, it screws it all up for everybody.
Like last time, Paul was on his speaker phone, and we were like, Paul, you're up, and he'd be like, I'm what?
And we'd say, Thomas picked Randy Moss, he's off the board.
And he'd say, What? It just... it just really sucked.
That's the same robe you wore to the leper colony.
I don't know, maybe throw it in the dryer at least?
Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not taking advice about germs from a whore.
It's Passover, and somebody tricked me into eating leavened bread!
If it isn't spaghetti, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Now get out of here!
You still have that meeting with that Judas Iscariot regarding that Jesus fella.
The lepers, the Canaanites, the fishermen, the Philippians, that woman at the well.
Listen, I got 30 pieces of silver if you narc on your friend Jesus.
Okay, we're all gonna be at the Jerusalem El Torito at 5:15.
I just went to the bathroom. The whole patio's open.
Almost, my wife Stephanie is out pooping on some hay, but she is here.
Hey, guys, I want to have fun with the seating.
Let's do it boy, boy... boy, boy... boy, boy... boy, boy.
And let's all sit on the same side of the table.
Can I start you folks off with anything to drink?
And can we have some bread and no other food at all?
Your photos will be available in the lobby when your meal is over.
Sorry about that, I was kind of right in the middle of my thing.
Before the night is over, one of you will betray me.
I'm the only one who's the color we're supposed to be in this thing.
All right, I'm not leaving here until I kiss a guy.
I'm not gonna say what part, but you're supposed to eat it while kneeling.
You're never gonna believe what this is supposed to be.
We wish it was our birthday, so we could party, too, hey!
I mean, it's not like this is our last supper.
Listen, pal, I forgive you, because you know not what you do, but get the hell out of here.
Oh, you think so? It was a chicken fight of biblical proportions. And then, there was Easter. Also, pregnant ladies have to have the baby.
We got to spend time as a family, and read a few stories from the Bible.
You're right. And look, somebody bookmarked another page for us.
Maybe there's one more story we can all learn an important lesson from... oh, oh, it's a whole big toenail.
Okay, all right, last one across the highway to Applebee's has to pay.
Watch out, I got God on my side, I will (BLEEP) kill you!
Yeah, now we got three months of sour-smelling house to look forward to while it dries out.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna get a job as a night security guard and just read it constantly.
I'm already putting lots of notes in the margins. And the king said unto her, 'What aileth thee?' And she answered, 'This woman said unto me, give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
Look, man, I was just seeing if anyone dropped off my umbrella at the lost and found.
Well, let's see. There's got to be something in here for that.
Chris, I can't believe you're helping the principal with morning announcements today.
You're going to be like one of those DJs on SiriusXM, where it's all national so nothing's local anymore.
Hey, it's hot out there, but it's also cold in some places.
I'm going to be massaging your shoulders, just so I can say in court that I do it to everyone.
And if you want to liven things up, you can start out by saying, Good morning, Vietnam!
Okay, well, the student council meeting will be held today at 3:00 in the gymnasium.
Ugh, I feel like I gained 20 pounds just standing next to him.
I have to open the window to get that fat kid smell out.
I can't stand to hear Italians talk but, man, get 'em singing.
Stewie, how can you afford an entire opera in your room?
Oh, boy, Brian's upset because someone has something he doesn't.
Brian, I'd love to stay and talk, but Bugs Bunny is about to make this tenor hold a note for far longer than anyone should.
As a courtesy to the hardworking cast and crew, we ask you to please refrain from looking at your iPad
Principal Shepherd fat-shamed Chris in front of the whole school.
That fat is going to win him Biggest Boy at the state fair.
School should be a safe place where they get shot sometimes.
So we're all decided, our last high school play was about as gay as we wanna go.
Let's try to top out at that level of gay.
There's still the agenda item of you fat-shaming Chris Griffin.
I think we can table that, as long as it's a pretty strong table.
Sure, more than once I've caught him eating Crisco with a spoon, but I can't watch everything he eats.
And deep down, he's just like everyone else... all together in one big pair of pants.
In any case, Principal Shepherd needs to be held accountable for fat-shaming my son.
If your son had been shot, all I could offer is thoughts and prayers, but this calls for a far stronger response.
I can finally tell you all how I really feel about you!
Uh, excuse me. I saw a commercial in which a dog had a very shiny coat.
I don't know that book. I'm talking about this one.
Hey, do you know where I could find any books about, um... the pan-crease?
But then once you get here, you realize you can sit anywhere.
That's right. And it's just Firstname Shepherd now that you've had me fired and I have no income.
And now I'm living in my car, just panhandling outside Miles Teller movies, which is pretty slim pickings, obviously.
Lois, can I talk to you one step over this way, yet magically out of earshot from him?
We can't let this stand. We have to do something for him.
What are we supposed to do? He brought this on himself.
All right, Peter, he can live with us until he gets back on his feet.
Also, would it make any sense to put all the beds in one room and make one room a trampoline room?
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I don't know how to thank you.
Chris? There's someone here who's got somethin' to say to you!
Chris, I fat-shamed you, and I believe I owe you a weaselly political apology.
Now, I believe you have some masturbating to do, young man?
Well, if someone had returned my mower when they said they were going to,
Whoa, I see the mower isn't the only thing running hot.
But speaking of, I, uh, need to borrow a shovel.
Well, I guess I know where you got all that money!
All I'm doing is presenting you honestly to the public.
Who but a witch would not give up her virtue to a man who brought her a luncheon of salt pork and boiled sweets?
But Your Honor, I tried to give up my virtue.
Uh, we think you would be more comfortable eating in the special breakfast unit.
She doesn't have her teaching degree, but she is abnormally strong.
We're trying to get you ready to eat with your family.
I don't even know what penises look like 'cause I'm not gay.
I do, I just don't look at it 'cause I'm not gay.
Now, if it was a vagina, I'd say you have your man.
And my aunt. She fell out of the casket at her funeral and her dress came up.
Did you know they pack cotton in corpses' noses, rectums and vaginas to prevent embalming fluid from leaking?
Anyway, I gave the eulogy at the church and I talked about it.
Now that preacher won't even make eye contact with me at the grocery store.
I don't know why that bothers me, but it does.
What were we talking about? Oh, yeah, your car got donged.
I represent Brian Griffin, who is suing you for defamation.
Je was watching Je Love Lucy, then je... was wondering why Lucy wasn't talking so much, and then je realized it was just a orange cat in a ashtray.
Just join me one step over here, yet out of earshot, so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.
If you'll all just help me get my things out of the basement.
Wait a minute. He doesn't have his stuff down here.
We-we... uh, okay, we're gonna deal with that thing and then we're gonna deal with detention.
How long is Principal Shepherd gonna keep us in detention down here?
Got to get out of here for a big date?
At least I'm not a withered old slut like you are.
It's natural that we'd be at each other's throats, all right?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no... Meg, Meg, Meg!
Thank you, Your Honor. In my case to prove that Brian Griffin is, in fact, an idiot, and therefore cannot be defamed, I call Brian Griffin to the stand.
Now, Mr. Griffin, you claim that you are not dumb.
If that is true, please tell me the difference between Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg.
Now, Mr. Griffin, I'm going to recite a biography and I'd like you to maintain your composure. On December 1, 1951,
At this point, I will turn things over to Brian's lawyer, the gentleman from Table, Knee, Bump and Associates.
Sucks being in detention. I feel like we're in The Breakfast Club or something.
We got to Breakfast Club dance for the Fox promo.
This Sunday, on an all-new Family Guy, the Griffins are grounded and the one actor of color plays a character named Lawnmower Guy.
This must've been why Principal Shepherd locked us down here.
Like when my old high school crush asked to be my friend on Facebook.
The game begins. Hey, cutie. Long time, no talk. I'm trapped in Europe and all I have is my bikini.
We all feel we need another night at the Hyatt with free HBO.
That free HBO was just a preview. It ended today.
I mean, I can't believe you'd do this to me.
I'm gonna walk out that door, come back in and you'll just be excited to see me.
And again, we cannot show you the nude photos the Spanish teacher sent to that kid.
Well, I guess that's it. Let's get out of here.
My name is Peter Griffin, and I get to the in conclusion part of my speech faster than most people.
In conclusion, I think the school should rehire Principal Shepherd.
Sorry, Lois, I needed you out of the way so I could kiss this lady.
Not me. I wouldn't even know how to draw one.
I've only seen two: mine and my uncle's at his funeral.
Oh, yeah, your desk got donged. Yeah, I did it. It was me.
If anything, you gave me a good chance for some self-reflection.
Fact is, you inspired me to get back to doing some writing.
Oh, thanks, but I no longer write the Flunky books.
Can you say one of your catchphrases, like, Hey, sailor, or Up for brunch?
Read it to me while I eat my soup. Ferb was having a throbby morning.
It's all just weird foreign sports fans, like those Pakistani cricket hooligans.
If you are not rooting for Lahore, please you may leave, I can tell you!
Lahore cricketers are the best, and the others are not the best, dear friends.
I'm for Karachi, but I don't got a death wish about it.
That's a stupid idea. There's not gonna be anything good in that dumpster.
What if I told you everything I'm wearing right now
Scott said I could do hand stuff this weekend, but that's it.
I can shake anything and figure out what all's in there.
This'll be good for when I never want to sleep again.
Guys, from now on, I am living my life according to the Magic 8 Ball.
It will lead me like the shorebird that led the first Pilgrims to Boston.
Ahoy! Are you looking to build a city where sports fans can be notoriously racist?
And can our own 9/11 be, like, one one-thousandth as bad, but we'll still make a fricking movie about it?
Okay, I don't know if this is gonna be a problem, but we forgot to bring the letter R.
This is the first black ball that Kim Kardashian hasn't played with.
Why is it filled with the blue liquid from tampon commercials?
That question aside, I'm having a blast with my new 8 Ball.
Magic 8 Ball, will my middle-of-the-highway puppet show be a success?
Mr. Griffin, if a Magic 8 Ball asked you to jump off a building, would you do that, too?
Magic 8 Ball, what's the best email provider? Outlook good. Interesting.
He's not raving about it, but it's a solid choice.
Mom said they're gonna serve Chewy Chips Ahoy at coffee hour.
Sorry, Lois, but my religion is now the 8 Ball.
Magic 8 Ball, is the Fox network sustainable in this new streaming world?
I just want my cookie so I can go home.
I remind you that... in honor of Lent... today's coffee service will not include Chewy Chips Ahoy.
We have to leave right now and go straight to breakfast.
I can't believe Stewie finally said his first word and it ends up being... that.
Right now, every woman in my mommy wine group is judging me.
I may have to start drinking wine at home alone.
I was feeling so much intense emotion in the moment, and that one word somehow just burst through.
What if that's the only thing I'll ever be able to express?
Anger. What kind of a person would I be then?
Larry David, Lewis Black, a Trump voter, everyone on Twitter.
But I don't want to be any of those things.
I brought my own veggie burgers, but I'm not gonna make a big deal about it.
Stewie would be a good influence on the other children.
Is there a designated spot on the grill for the veggie burgers?
You're saying that because of a swear word, my son isn't good enough for your pool party?
It's a little bit about him swearing, but mostly about you as a parent.
No, he didn't. The only show he watches is Caillou.
Well, then that little French-Canadian weirdo is the potty mouth, I'm sure of it.
And I'm willing to watch every single episode just to prove it.
Why am I bald? I'm not a baby. I'm four.
Maybe I'm supposed to be a cancer survivor, and this show is very inspiring.
Caillou's low-testosterone father again indulged Caillou's tantrum, clearly trying to raise a sociopath.
Oh. I-I, um... I watched that Caillou, and you're right.
That means he learned it from someone in this house.
I'm gonna set a trap and lure the swearer into revealing himself.
Hey, what's with the stairs? Why do they look different?
Oh, I'm trying to prove that Peter's the one cussing in the house, so I waxed the staircase for him to fall down.
In fact, I'm meeting him at the park to eat unsalted saltines on the swings.
I feel like you're wearing what Rachel Maddow would wear to a pumpkin patch.
Lois couldn't find the swearer, nor could she remove the voice of the grating Caillou narrator from her head.
I see the Instacart people in there emotionlessly filling up their baskets.
We're a family establishment, so take your foul-mouthed baby and go away!
When a mom is shunned by groceries, she has nothing!
Lois was sad, but not as sad as she was going to be when she realizes she has to use those ouchie wipes to make a potty next to the store dumpster.
I've corrupted my baby with my foul language and my terrible anger.
And Lofthouse cookies weren't available at any other grocery store?
I have to deal with my anger and fix myself.
So I've decided to attend this relaxation retreat at Vista del Vista Resort.
Plus, if I go, that means I won't be here to help out around the house or feed you guys or monitor your Internet usage every day...
Uh, I don't know what that was, but, Lois, you should go to that resort.
Just like that time me and Chris went Jet Ski'ing.
Lois Griffin? My name is Roger, and I'll be guiding this relaxation adventure for you and the other white women, plus an Asian woman who has a white husband back home.
Now sit down and enjoy some spa music that's mostly rain.
Hey, guys, can we take it from the rain again?
Ah, this is the perfect amount of drunk for a Filet-O-Fish.
I'm, um, Trey Headband, and I'm your dumb yoga instructor?
I'm gonna go to that bathroom right there and do explosive diarrhea.
If you hear a sound, just, um, rec-knowledge it and then, like, let it go?
All right, let's check in on Peter and the baby.
Okay, Stewie, time for Daddy to mow this very rocky backyard.
So I'll just put you in this baby seat you've grown out of, right where the rocks are gonna fly.
Let me start with another friendly reminder to please not flush your feminine products.
The yard over the septic tank out back looks like a Braveheart battlefield.
Okay. Now it's time for everyone to choose a mantra.
It's like a word you say that brings you peace.
I mean, I'm just saying... I already have a word that does all those things when I say it.
No, no, maybe I'm not perfect, but I'm a good person.
And there are worse things than occasionally using a swear word.
Everyone's glad you're home, except for mean older brother Buzz, who never says anything nice.
Aw, I guess he's not such a bad guy after all.
But there's one little guy I missed most of all.
Well, well, I guess he doesn't feel like it anymore.
Wow, Stewie, kind of a big deal that your second word was Mommy.
Makes me think you don't want to kill her and maybe you love her.
You thought you were a big wheel till you found out squares don't roll, man.
The Stew-man spun you round like a Bill Evans 45.
No one wants us at their apartment party, ya dig?
Rupert, remember that very expensive bottle of coconut water I got from Pressed Juicery in Newport that we were saving for a special occasion?
Well, I'm going to need you to get two Dixie cups and open it!
I got Busy Bee for the second week in a row!
Miss Debby said that I was the best at sharing and helping.
You were right, Rupert. I did exactly as you said.
I just took it one day at a time and minded my own beeswax, and now look.
This is good for us. This is very good for us.
I know I wasn't originally supportive when you joined A.A., but I have to say,
I mean, it works when you work, so work it.
Nobody's ever gotten Busy Bee three weeks in a row before, and with you by my side, I know I can do it.
You know, you look good. I don't tell you that enough.
I want to show you how much I appreciate you.
I just went to the market and got a new crate.
Ugh, can't you ever come back from shopping without looking like you were getting supplies for a refugee camp?
You know what? I actually do want some animal crackers, so... to be continued.
The stuff is in the top drawer, so just, you know, get it ready.
Oh, no, no. No, no, I don't want you to kill anyone.
We've been firing on all cylinders lately, and I just wanted to let him know I care.
He's, like, three years old, and he's in a mobility scooter rolling around an oxygen tank.
I thought Rupert was mine first, not some multigenerational family dong koozie.
Ah, ah, ah, don't. Don't run out, don't run out.
I've j... I've had a lot of time to think, and, well, look, I-I don't see why this has to change anything between us.
I want to get on stage and talk about my husband and how he leaves the toilet seat up, et cetera.
Must I show you my genitalia in order to book a gig at this establishment?
(regular voice): Can I just stick around a little bit so I can go up onstage when you guys win an Emmy?
Uh, thank you to the Academy and to all the viewers who watch.
FYI, I'm more in love with Michelle, if that was even possible.
Well, if you want to go over to Chris's room...
I said I wouldn't do that, and I did it.
It's just that sometimes I picture you in his bed, and...
I didn't get it. They gave Busy Bee to Frederick.
Look, we're both adults. We can split custody of Simon.
I don't even know how to process that, so I'm just gonna crack on.
I have somebody here that would like to see you.
I know you're going to try and stop me, but hear me...
But don't worry, I don't use it for sexual purposes.
Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.
What are you looking at?! I told you that was one night!
I was just putting some product in my hair, you know.
He was kind of holding me back, if I'm being honest.
It's time I got out there again. I've had one bear my whole life.
I mean, I've already wasted a whole year of my life with him.
You know, all of your responses have been very similar, so you might want to nip that in the bud.
Look, the truth is, things got a bit stale between us.
There wasn't one part of Rupert's body that I didn't know by heart.
Well, do you want me to keep an eye on Rupert for you?
I-I don't know how to respond that won't sound similar to other responses I've made, so just, uh, continue.
Right. Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact, ten minutes later, I'll get a chime notification on my phone, and I can pull up the video.
I don't know. Why can't you poop on a toilet?
Damn it. You could've at least given me some warning.
Ah, I see you got my text to bring Rupert to dinner.
He's just here 'cause I got gum on him and he stuck to my hand.
Please tell me Rupert looked fat, Brian. I'm begging you.
Just a warning, I had some bad experiences at camp, so now I sleep with one eye open.
I just have to get an Uber to the airport.
Excuse me, I'm in Bali on a spiritual journey but I seem to have mistakenly wandered on to the heavy people beach.
Do you happen to know where the thin, attractive beach is?
Thank you and good luck with whatever's going on with you.
Hey. You should've seen the pigs where I was before.
I'm only wearing a Speedo because that's what they wear in this country.
(chuckles): If I... if I weren't wearing one, then I would stand out, right?
Mm. So anyway, so I'm-I'm Eat Gay Loving it and it's-it's going great.
And I... Yeah, I finally feel like I'm getting my life together again af-after the breakup.
Th-The whole point of-of this journal... spirit... spiritual journal... j-journey, spiritual journey...
Why-why was that so hard? ...is to be Stewie, you know?
I can't keep track of how much I'm drinking. Thank you.
I hope you have found the peace you have come here looking for.
I guess that means I'll miss that taping of Deepak Choprah Winfrey.
It was the best thing I could have done for myself.
You know, I'm actually gonna make it up to them.
I'm happy I'm back, too. Oh, and you can skip India.
That black-and-white TV still has a white dot from when they turned it off six years ago.
Hey, Chris, just checking to see how long before you and Rupert get here.
Goodness, I haven't done a maniacal laugh in a while.
I don't know why I said I was making dinner.
They're here! I can't wait for Rupert to see how good I look.
Anyhoo, it is so good to see the two of you.
I made it. I told you I was making dinner.
Well, it's not! You know, you're making this thing a whole lot easier.
I thought I could live with the idea of you and Rupert together, I-I really did.
Knowing he loves you and not me, it's too painful and I now realize...
I now realize the only way I can go on with my life is by ending yours.
I did m... All right, look, we're-we're getting off track here.
Oh, we got a nice evening for this. Nice evening.
You can turn around right now and go back home.
Okay, Rupert, so remember, we sit through a nice dinner and then you go back with Stewie.
Because I love my little brother, and so do you.
And I didn't want to say it because I-I didn't know if you were going to say it back and oh, what a fool I've... Chris!
I don't think Jordan Peele has the talent we've attributed to him.
Because of the lake water, uh, I said some things that I did not mean.
Jordan Peele is our greatest living filmmaker, and visionary, both in comedy and in drama.
Well, you have a lovely day and we'll see you when you get home.
I think we can get a heart from this kid.
Some lady up the block is giving away all of her husband's stuff 'cause he shot himself
So, kids, bonnie just told me about the neatest thing.
I guess it's like a-a radio show on your phone.
I guess these types of things take a while to reach the moms.
Mom, Stewie needs his sausage cut and his butter spread.
And Bonnie wants to know what all the noise is.
Since Willem Dafoe has more bones in his face than most people have in their entire body, he's perfect for carving, 'cause the angles are so sharp.
Spell it, Joe! Spell what you are saying right now.
Look, there's a reason I became a cop and not a spellman.
Now I'm starting to think there is such a thing as a spellman.
You know how hard it was to get that thing started?
It was even worse than trying to cover anything with saran wrap.
Oh, hey, Lois. I'm just hollowing out this tree for the Keebler elves to live in.
Gonna get us a lifetime supply of fresh-baked-but-still-stale supermarket cookies.
It looks like the tree landed on its parents and killed them.
I wonder if... M-maybe I could take care of it.
I don't know if you should do it on your own.
You know what? I think that's a marvelous idea, Chris.
I saw this tree go down. Any loot in it?
Did you hear that one vet technician say our little squirrel here was in the 70th percentile for height and weight?
The one we saw smoking in the parking lot when we were leaving.
It's like you've been waiting your whole life to be this person.
That was me. It was one of my cross-legged ones.
Well, if it's your elbow that's bothering you, we should start by checking your reflexes.
But you got to help me. My arm really hurts.
Well, it sounds to me like you may have chain saw elbow.
Congratulations on suffering from the coolest arm ailment there is:
As a celebrity dick, it's always been my passion to own a ranch in a low-tax state that I list as my primary residence.
I'm out in the field cutting firewood for a staged Instagram post.
Sometimes I overdo it, end up with chain saw elbow.
Now here's fellow ranch owner Dennis Quaid to discuss the dangers of tractor ass.
I'm trying to prescribe enough to earn a fanny pack.
Well, there's a trucker hat, but those look stupid on me.
You know, sometimes joint pain is connected to back issues.
It's a procedure where a guy who couldn't get into medical school
But this type of thing is usually done in strip malls next to a little caesars.
I'm saying you need to strengthen your core and exercise regularly.
I know the holidays are still months away, but I was just so excited to take our family Christmas card photo.
It's the only one where the squirrel wasn't trying to bite your hand.
I don't know. I only get pants at Christmas, so...
Although I've noticed I'm a lot more clumsy in the bedroom.
Totally! But we should pair it with a song about steps or walking.
I will concede that's a good song, but we don't live in Memphis, so I find it confusing.
Ah. Hoisted on my own petard. Nobody Walks in L.A.
This is going to surprise you, Chris, but I agree with you.
It means a lot to Stewie and me that you would be here.
Everyone, after the service, you are all invited to a small reception to honor our beloved squirrel.
It'll take place either on top of the fence or along a power line.
But, first, please join me in a frozen-in-place moment of silence, followed by a manic scattering in all directions.
The squirrel is gone, Stewie, and there's nothing we can do to change that.
Yes, thanks to you. If it weren't for you, our sweet baby would still be alive.
If you hadn't kept the squirrel up so late, none of this would have happened.
What? I'm not the one who just had to post the video to Instagram that very second.
You couldn't even enjoy the moment for one damn minute before desperately groveling for online approval from aunts you never talk to and past coworkers you don't even like!
Is that so? Well, if you had a newer phone, it wouldn't have taken so long to upload the video.
And don't think I didn't smell the Charleston Chew on your breath at the service.
Maybe if you'd been a little sharper on the evening in question, we wouldn't be in this...
Why does death seem so much easier in the Rocky movies?
Oh, wai... you're just gonna put him in a drawer?
They just slowly depreciate and then are eventually written off.
I had a hard enough time getting everything in the toilet before.
The female power to belittle is such that the recipient can physically shrink in stature.
That's why husbands and wives are the same height in old age.
Okay, Peter, but if I do this, I really got to do it.
The way you chew a banana makes it sound like it's filled with bones.
I loathe the little wheeze at the crest of every breath you take.
I hate the one story you tell at every cocktail party about almost meeting John Kerry.
Everyone hates it when you see fireworks and you announce, this is the finale!
I know every word that's gonna come out of your mouth before you even say it.
Well, let me first start by saying y'all's doing your relationship a huge favor by coming to couples counseling.
Now, why don't y'all start by each trying to suck up to me so I can choose who I'm-a side with?
Well, I'm Stewart, and I would love to offer you a freshly baked brownie.
I'm Chris. I'm somehow both signing the checks and always wrong.
It's both 100% true and also the worst thing anybody could possibly say.
Excuse me if I don't buy into this whole headshrinker business.
Stewie promised he'd make healthy meals for us, but all he ever makes is frozen pizza.
You said you loved pizza, especially when I make the ones with the crust made of hwheat.
This is all stuff I've talked about with my life coach, Kyle.
Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story while I share looks with Stewart that say, whoa, this is what you got to deal with?
Stewie won't stop blaming me about the death, but it's not my fault.
I just don't know what to do with all these feelings!
Which is why... I suppose I've been taking them out on you.
We can't bring our baby back, but we'll always have Tuesday through Friday of last week.
I's just gonna open up this big book and use the time you're paying for to figure out when you're next available.
It was a true pleasure parenting our squirrel with you, Chris.
Huh. Well, then maybe it's better that our baby you molested is dead.
I got to put on my swimsuit that's a one-piece that turns into shorts.
Once you hit a certain age, that's the swimsuit you have for the next 40 years.
Hey, Lois, you remember that time you and me made it under the boardwalk?
When I go back to school, my greaser friends are gonna say, Tell me more, tell me more, and I'm gonna say you were a slut.
Let's sneak away from the kids and go get busy.
Oh, I'd love to, Peter, but here comes Chris with a too-much-sun beach tantrum.
Mom, I tried to look at a... lady who was lying with her... straps down and she saw me and she said something to her friend and they laughed!
Come on, Brian. I'm gonna make you a YouTube surfin' dog.
You know, one of those videos where you can't tell if he's enjoying it or not.
Tanner became Head of Household, while host Julie Chen had plastic surgery to look less Chinese.
Later, Sasha won veto power over Eric but not before Julie married
And Les himself was accused of assaulting more than a dozen women.
With nominations looming and Les fired for his predatory behavior, the Boys Alliance of Jeremy and Pablo strategized while Julie stepped down from The Talk to avoid uncomfortable questions, but continues to host this show and spend Les' enormous wealth.
And what does it actually mean to have an employee on call for oral?
Seems like a safe place to open a full bag of Cheez Doodles.
Okay, I'll give you one, but don't tell your friends.
I snarfed a bunch of oysters from over there, where the foam is super yellow.
Locals have renamed me Sandy Crevices, and they're absolutely right.
Well, I guess I'll go throw this candy wrapper in the beach trash.
So, what should we do now that we're finally down here?
How 'bout we do something that ain't been done under a pier in 50 years: have heterosexual sex.
So, a strange man is changing Stewie on our blanket.
Hey, Lois, I know we ain't under the boardwalk no more, but
Damn it! What do we got to do to get some time to ourselves?
You guys are more frustrating than trying to sell men's suits in Australia.
Can you make 'em shorts, cut off the sleeves, and make the shirt say Billabong?
I really want people to see my snow-white back hair against my brown skin.
All I know is that we both set up this cutaway at the same time, and now we're inside this cutaway in Australia.
So, you and I set up a cutaway at the same time and that somehow put us in the cutaway?
Well, this is weirder than an uptight guy at an Eagles concert.
I set up the cutaway by myself, and it sent us here.
And it takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.
Lois, are you saying that it takes a setup from both of us to get in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand?
Exactly, Peter. It takes a setup from both of us to get in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.
Not anyone who wants to get there in one piece.
Peter, this may sound crazy, but this is our chance at the getaway we didn't have at the beach.
Like... like when we hid in Tom Brady's locker and watched him shower.
It's just as big as you want it to be but not so big that it's gonna distract him.
Don't look at the Trump hat. Look at his penis.
This is better than a spin class where the instructor is just two giant Swedish legs.
Peter and Lois were right here talking to us, and they just disappeared.
All right, just keep giving me details and I'll be taking notes and definitely not drawing cool TIE fighters on this notepad.
Okay, well, it was 5:30 and we'd all just gotten back from the beach.
Then, out of nowhere, Peter and Lois get all angry with us and start yelling at us.
But, wait, look at that perfectly drawn Millennium Falcon. Roar! said Chewbacca.
Chris, now that Mom and Dad are gone, we should have a rager.
We really had a hard time syncing our schedules this week.
It-It's like a honeymoon in CutawayLand, away from our kids.
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia. R as in Robert Loggia. O as in Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia. B as in By God, that's Robert Loggia.
Longer than it took to get my iPad back from Chris.
He got folded over on himself, so he's still wet on the other side.
Damn it! It's always the first one of the batch.
All right, get him in a room and give him 20 cc's of Log Cabin negative.
The butter burned, so there's a crispy black circle around the circumference.
Tell the family he's going to lose his outer crust.
Is that girl here who wears the butt cheek bottom shorts?
Do you happen to know if they're having a party tonight?
I chose this cutaway 'cause it's fun and for sure not to feed my fentanyl addiction.
Ooh! And next door is a classic song about AIDS that I now partly regret.
Peter, this has been fun, but I want to go back home.
That's the name of the guy with the AIDS. Next room over.
Lois, our kids suck and cutaways are good. What's the problem here?
Peter, enough. I know you want to have fun with drugs, but what's the point of drugs if you don't have kids to share 'em with?
Damn it, Lois. We're having fun for once, but all you can talk about is the kids.
And with any luck, we'll get home by wine o'clock.
Okay, you don't like these jokes, but let's see what all the moms eating soup at Panera Bread think.
This is like the time we were together with our family.
I haven't been given a morsel of food since you left, by the way. Not one crumb.
And now to exhibit the only power I have in this world.
This is like the time we were together with our family at home.
This is better than being at home. We make a better team than at home. Worse than at home? The AIDS person is Tom Devanney, which is the name of a Family Guy writer home?
Yeah. I'm also bummed 'cause I'm missing that Australian guy's marriage to his catamaran.
And now, if there are any spiders the size of dinner plates that object to this marriage, please speak now or forever hold your peace.
Wait, so, when you two disappeared, you were just doing cutaways?
In our defense, we only disappeared 'cause we don't like you.
I still don't get it, but let's just move on.
Shut up, everyone, shut up! First things first, did you clean up the house before coming to CutawayLand?
'Cause if it's found messy, it's gonna reflect poorly on me.
I just wanted to let myself in to your private residence.
We got to get out of here. Come on, let's think.
Joe was looking for you guys before. Maybe he can help.
Oh, my God, don't even get me started on those guys.
Joe, shut up. No one cares. Just tell me, are you in the real world, or are you a cutaway?
Well, according to a 16-year-old autistic fan in Akron, Ohio, In order for the Griffins to escape from a theoretical CutawayLand, they must first journey back to the original Family Guy cutaway with Adolf Hitler and kill him.
That's it! We'll kill Hitler to prevent CutawayLand and nothing else.
But how do we get there? Our setups aren't working.
Well, this is where it gets a little complicated. In order to return to the original cutaway, each family member must...
Peter, I got to admit, I'm not comfortable with this plan.
Yeah, I know he was evil, but do we really have the right to take the life of another human being?
You've been passed out for 22 minutes, babbling about cutaways and Hitler.
God, can you believe that Trump hung himself in prison?
I know! And that Chris Christie lost all that weight.
Hey, Peter. If you have a sec, there's something I want to talk to you about.
So, I came over to invite you to Susie's christening this weekend.
And I don't just want you to be a guest.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to be the godfather.
Yeah, you're my best friend, and, well, I'd like you to be Susie's godfather, too.
Perhaps we should discuss this further in my poorly-lit den.
What are you guys discussing? And when did we get a den?
Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather is closing the door in your wife's face while she wonders what's going on inside.
Damn it, Peter, being Susie's godfather doesn't mean you're in the mob.
Now, before the child goes in the water, has it been at least 20 minutes since she ate?
I hereby christen this child in the name of Jesus Christ, who was killed by we-don't-know-who, it's not important.
The last thing we want to do is point fingers...
Can you please take my daughter out of the water?
From now on, every Sunday you get to eat a hard cookie and pretend it's a guy.
Coffee in the smallest cup we have, as you requested.
And let me assure you, any shouting you hear from the kitchen is not Gordon Ramsay tearing us apart.
Oh, God, here comes Doug. He just got a race car bed, and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.
So, your mom still taking you to the ladies' room
I don't look at those. I'm too busy fixing my hair in the mirror... Oh! I'm sorry.
Uh, it's a very special day, as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ before she can consent to it or have any conception of what's happening.
Thanks, Chris, but let's wait till we're called upon, bud.
Joe, thank you for having us in this restaurant with a painted wall that makes Venice look terrible.
Uh, for the kids, we've got games and also a party princess dressed as Elsa who's clearly a prostitute, but please don't proposition her here, just nod in her direction, trust me, she'll get it.
I'm the godfather of this event, and I want a debilitating wine-and-candy headache.
Grazie. Now please name the menu item I ordered after me.
All right, we'll find something else. Thank you very much.
I was invited to sit at the first grade table.
God, I can't believe Mike Pence came out of the closet just before he hung himself in prison.
I'll be touching faces a lot more than I used to.
And I'll be totally oblivious to the affair between my bodyguard and my wife.
What, do you got cotton in your ears? Answer her.
And as a mafioso, I'll be doing more voice-overs, which will always begin by naming everyone at the event.
Little Stew and Uncle Junior Grandpa Nephew who was my cousin.
It was one of those breakfasts where you realize you put on your boxers the wrong way and you need an excuse to leave the room.
Interesting question. My value system will vary wildly between incredible immorality and intense social conservatism.
It's a very cocky name for an average pasta sauce.
The rest of this is just jokes, but that's kind of a good point.
Now, kids, before you go to school, let's discuss what you tell your friends about me.
That your fingernails are so filthy because you do scratchers all day?
You're not safe here anymore, so I'm gonna send you where all the murderers are from.
Check it out. Like all cool mobsters, my office is at a strip club.
I don't care one bit if you laugh at my jokes.
I mean, this is the Mafia, not the Laugh Factory, right?
What?! You said we don't have to like your jokes.
And, Joe, you're a cop, how are you okay with any of this?
I have to do voice-over naming everyone at the event.
It was me, Glenn Quags, Joey Swan and Downtown Julie Cleveland Brown.
You remember when there were two Julie Browns in the '90s?
With the guys at my side, we were the most powerful criminal organization in Quahog
We lived like kings, until things started to come apart after the Lufthansa heist.
We discussed laying low, but not everyone agreed with that.
I'm gonna have it with my last can of cream soda.
Let's take a ride and get some at the grocery store.
Even since Dad became a mobster, he's been giving me a ton of Italian children's books.
Hey, what do you say you and I do a little fishing?
You know, Peter, you've been a mobster for a while now.
I'm surprised we haven't had any run-ins with rival families.
Like, look at this, this morning, totally unprompted, they sent me a lovely wrapped fish.
Yesterday, one of them even drove by my house to say
I had a beautiful family and it would be a shame if anything happened to them.
When's the last time you guys said something like that?
They returned it! You know how many guys would keep something like that?
I think you need to get wise to what's going on here, because their next message may not be so subtle.
Oh, thank God, the Mafia doesn't hate me. You's dead, fat ass.
I do the homework and you get to throw the rock?
The coach from University of Vermont invited me to walk on!
I did it to chuck rocks and eat sandwiches out of foil.
God, I can't believe Melania was deported to Slovenia and then hung herself in a European prison.
Man, Peter, what are you gonna do about the mob?
I'm gonna hide and change my identity to a name no one else has ever heard of.
You know, Peter, there may be a way out of this.
Cops have been trying to bring down the Rhode Island mob for years.
If you can schedule a meeting to discuss your differences and wear a wire, we'll arrest them after.
La dolce vita de duay que questa di Beverly Hills BMW.
Now, if you get into trouble, department regulations say we can't go in there unless you say a code phrase.
Something that you'd never actually say in conversation so we know it's a signal.
The phrase is, Did you see the new Paul Rudd movie?
No, no, you have to say it exactly. Heartwarming? I-I mean, I could just say heartwarming.
I don't know. I assume it started with God's father.
Hey, Dad, I wrote a big show, and your grandson Jesus is in it.
He's kind of the star of it, really. Can you make it?
Listen, I'm getting pulled into this meeting right now, but good luck with your thing.
I promise I'm going to be so nice to my son.
Just act natural. And even though you're miked, try not to use your radio voice.
This is Peter Whirlybird Griffin comin' at you on a sizzlin' Sunday afternoon.
We're glad that you finally decided to play ball with us.
You come to me today, on the day of me daughter's barbecue.
I'd like to introduce you all to my suspenseful son,
And-and the guy says, Oh, I thought you were complaining about your angina.
Sure. I can use the mic taped to my chest.
H-Hold on, I'm just allowing Linkedln to send automated e-mails to all my contacts.
I said don't do anything stupid. Peter Griffin wants to add you to his professional network.
Hey, what do you say you and me go for a walk in the woods?
I thought you were gonna do some kind of Godfather murder on me.
