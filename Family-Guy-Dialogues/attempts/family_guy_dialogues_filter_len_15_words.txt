Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the fire chamber for tattling on your brother.
No, thanks. See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Don't pout, honey. When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman!
As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party.
And so the Lord God smote poor Job with festering boils all over his body.
Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Not today or tomorrow.
You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean...
Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.
Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here.
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market.
When she worries, she says, I told you so and: Stop doing that. I'm asleep. So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?
Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth.
Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny.
The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys.
I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of.
I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich.
I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids.
No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into.
The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money!
Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football!
Amazing. You can barely drive a car. Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?
I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp.
Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old trying to make amends... ...for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds play.
I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football!
If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married.
Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie.
But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.
I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner?
I don't know. I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve.
But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father.
It sure was. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: She sells seashells down by the seashore.
Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. You've got a good 40 years on me, woman!
I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you.
The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Faloppia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.
If you catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him.
So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy!
I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy.
Come on. Let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00.
If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.
I know what I did was wrong. And I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you.
And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle, the sum...
Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time.
Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.
If I take the blame, he'll buy me a convertible when I get my license.
Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable.
Are you gonna tell me, or am I gonna have to show you my ass?
Class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea.
But at that moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends.
But only one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it.
The killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river!  Jinkies! What a mystery!
You just need to find something to fill the void that's left in your life.
I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends?
Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.
I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil.
I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money.
Your mother was right. It'd be a crime to sit around and wait for the TV.
There's a world out there waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs!
But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed.
There's only one show I want to see. It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself.
The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment?
Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together.
If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little...
The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here.
Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast, I'll do enough living for me and Bill.
If you help me out of here, I know a meadow where the blueberries are begging to be picked.
Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test can I still get a convertible?
It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life it's who you do it with, and your family...
I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your father.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters!
When Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything.
I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces?
I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be.
I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house.
I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt. Dear Diary... It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated  in that amniotic Attica. As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity  I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months.
I'm up to 11. As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white!
And now, one year hence, he's returning to rectify his mistake and put me back in the womb!
Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.
Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house.
So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he?
They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.
Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives.
Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home.
I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piata, the works!
You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it.
As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!
The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piata.
Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope.
Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.
I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?
I'm glad you could join us. We're gonna have a great time on our trip.
There. Now, if I can just find a midget with some gin, I'll be in business.
All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb.
Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity?
Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity?
In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born.
Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie.
It's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you.
For the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before?
And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.
I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death.
When life is getting to you put some fresh in your life Let Mintos freshen up your life Life is just a breeze when you stay fresh and cool Because Mintos puts the fresh in life Taste that freshness Just can't beat it Mintos freshness Let Mintos freshen your life
Must kill Lincoln. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game?
Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing around.
Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home.
Enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours!
Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine.
Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about the other times I broke the law.
All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you.
Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. Lois and the family sitting in a tree
Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came down to get some beers.
Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well.
You know those little clam cakes you make whenever we have company? I need about a dozen.
No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty.
You see, Misty my time manipulator employs axioms from the quantum theory of molecular propulsion.
Meg, take Stewie upstairs. Show me the way to go home Everybody! I'm tired and I want to go to bed Just the women!
Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I...
Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks. You'll never know just how much I love you You'll never know just how much I care
Yeah! And if I try, I still couldn't hide my love for you You oughta know for haven't I told you so?
All right! If there is some other way to prove that I love you I swear I don't know how
Nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife. You'll never know if you don't know now
Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight. Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for You know you got the brand of kisses that I die for
That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee! You know you made me love you
Hit it! Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta If someone takes a spill it's me and not you Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? It's got steam heat I got steam heat But I need your love to keep away the cold I got...
Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers.
No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special.
Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.
Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say I love you every day.
And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson.
Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home.
How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind.
Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless.

Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game.
More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H.
When Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy?
I hired Guillermo because I believe he'll be an asset to our company on and off the field.
Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures.
Cute as a button fat as a cow radioactive scorpion. Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.
Peter, they might be very nice people. Very nice people.  Yeah, that's what they always say.
Man. What'll I do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.
One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.
What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference.
Before you know it, you're using my supermarket my dry cleaner, and even my postman.
Gosh, I'd like to help. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on my ass for five minutes.
See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first.
If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them at home.
I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket.
Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys, you know to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!
All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. You think you have won You think all is well But kiss my green ass I shall see you in hell!
If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably I shall take the information from you by force!
Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.
It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero. He makes the world a better place.
Yes, you forgot the words. Jesus loves me He loves me a bunch Because He always puts Skippy In my lunch
Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you?
Actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell.
Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero.
This wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and...
I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company.
A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation.
If we want the cops to take us seriously, we have to waste a hostage. But who?
And even though society has turned its back on you I promise you there are people who care.
You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset.
Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it.
Yeah, Daddy. If you hadn't pulled this stunt I wouldn't know how to manipulate Kevin.
And when the kids at school see us on TV they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, That psycho is my dad!
I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano, had you not driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a. m.
She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. l shall give her a piece of my mind!
Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. ln fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.
Ladies, this Saturday at 0800 there will be a soapbox derby as a reward for all your obedience.
Anything on that remote lower than mute? l got a surprise for you, Chris. lt'll have to wait. This is where the Fonz goes....
Dad, what would you say if l told you l didn't want to be in the Scouts? l'd say come again? And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.''
Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room. l thought that was just when you were asleep.
What do you want? l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. l just want to draw. l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke.
Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter.
Chris, l am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again.
Do not go until l wave my flag. l can't stress that enough. l'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.
Your idiot son hasn't earned a single merit badge. lf you'll excuse me, l've got to administer some spankings.
But what l can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table.
Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore? l think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together.
What? Those bastards! Don't you worry. l'll get you back in! lt's okay, Dad. l'm not really--
This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha! l can't believe we're going to New York.
Yes, l do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts.
Damn it, JuIie. I'm a singIe mother doing the best damn job she knows how!
We are not lost. And even if we were l can't ask a human being for directions.
This is gonna be a photo finish, Lois! l'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie.
We're trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and defiled our women.
Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it. lt felt so good. l kept putting my money in.
That's okay. As long as you learned your lesson. l did, Peter, for a couple of minutes. Then....
Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. l sort of bet our car. l won't panic. l need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife.
Nice going, Mom. l finally get my driver's license and you lose the car to a poker machine.
We gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris back into the Scouts.
No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you? l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish. lt just seemed like such a good cause.
But we're not allowed to return gambling losses. l think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too.
Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past. l come from a long line of you people.
My great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. l mean, Chief Grand Cherokee. He was a rainmaker.
So are you gonna give me back my car, or what? l have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait here.
To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest.
Of course l do. l'm an lndian. But why don't you explain it to my wife?
And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth.
LOlS: Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. l'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.
Come on. All l gotta do is have a spiritual vision. l've had one before.
Now get the hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision.
How long do these vision quests usually take? lt varies. lt depends on the person's age, and height, and sign.
Why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies?
Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a noise?
But would any of you take the time to help me? l'm playing the world's smallest violin, Scott.
Yeah. But l'm your spiritual guide, see? l want to lay a little personal truth on you.
There's something l always wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.
Sure. Go right ahead. l don't want to be a Scout, Dad. l just don't have fun there.
Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision? lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees. And l saw the Fonz.
A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer. l want a spiritual vision, too! Man! l guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. l mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity.
But most Native Americans are proud hardworking people who are true to their spiritual heritage.

That hausfrau's cheap rayon blouses will make a serviceable parachute should I need to abandon my jet in mid-flight.
I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to hinder my work have not gone unnoticed.
Meanwhile, here at home Quahog remains in the sweltering grip of a freak heat wave.
Am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?
You could do your impression of a barbershop quartet. We were sailing along On Moonlight Bay We could hear the voices singing They seemed to say
Lois, honey, I love you but you're sucking all the energy out of the room.
Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. ...almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.
Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car!
I let you down? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the good dog?
The next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand?
It sure has. You know what they say, If you don't like... ...the weather in New England, go back where you came from.
Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra.
May I have one on a plate or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose?
That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak!
Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts.
I'll get us the best help there is. Dear MacGuyver... Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking straw. Please save my dog.
I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is.
This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin.
And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the oodmay but Brian won't amscray.
Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second.

Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself.
When you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered in flies with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston!

You're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa.
Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction?
He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger.
My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret in case things don't work out.

Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City he saw that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader.
It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace that he was able to see the error of his ways.
If I welsh on that debt, I'm gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois.
Brian, it's the Historical Society. We just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here.
So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born.

But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.
At mass this morning it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again.

Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me. So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell... ...where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever.
I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me?
That one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.
It'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your heart with leprosy.
I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!
Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years.
Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope.
The Rhode Island Cock Society is sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why the suggestive name.
Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue.
It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own.
I hate to say this but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you.
We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines.
Or you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory.
It's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.
Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son.
I'm not sure how that came up exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer.
Dad, some of the guys think that since you took over, work is no fun.
At least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working!
I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin' down and has a talk with his unemployed son.
If he needs to talk he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings!
I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity.
Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand a very devoted son.
We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down.
I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve.
I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn.
I always wake up fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.
Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.
Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. I was hoping you could change his mind.
Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.
Well, in that case, Dad l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.
I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me.
But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time.
We leave you with a look back at some of those we've lost this millennium.
You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.
Planes will fall out of the sky and all the world's nuclear weapons will explode,
Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for party over here!
And you know what? I bet you run into those two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court.
And you won't know which one is which. And it'll be really awkward. So bite me.
There's a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and... well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.
Yes, yes, I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my ass look big?
Oh, dear me. Yes, yes, this is how I wanted to enter the new millennium.
Thanks a lot. Right now I could be in Boston, pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.
We now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us?
Now that you mention it, the Y is a bit misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.
Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together.
Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nukular holocaust: cockroaches and Twinkees. And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.
We've followed the pied piper to the gates of oblivion and look what it's brought us.
We can settle down here and build a house just like we had in Quahog.
Yeah, and we can build a mall so I have a place to hang out.
And two Denny's, so we can say Let's not go to that one. Let's go to the good one.
We can dig Joe out of the driveway and we can build a community just like the one we had.
Yeah, I fold. Hey, come on. Let's go home and get tender with your wife.
But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a year.
I have a canker sore on my lip, and I keep pokin' at it with my tongue,
I'm the one who knew the world was gonna end and found the Twinkee factory.
I haven't been thrown outta any place since I was a counsellor at the bulimia clinic.
You remember the other day you were asking me what the definition of irony was?
Oh, Peter, hearing you say that almost makes it worth havin' the world blown up.
All right! Fudgie the Whale, and Cookie Puss, and Cookie O'Puss, and Nutty the Chocolate Ghost.
I dreamt I saw the strangest episode of Family Guy, and there was a giant chicken and Stewie was an octopus.
For 45 minutes I was out there screaming.  I know that cos my damn watch is broken!
Oh, is that what it is? Really? I could have sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food.
Hey, I can take this hat off any time I want. I just don't want to.
God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake.
Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.
Then you want You're a Naughty Child and That's Concentrated Evil Coming Out the Back of You.
They were so itchy I couldn't sleep, which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if I was OK and I said I couldn't sleep.
Come on, Stewie. Don't you wanna pee in the toilet bowl like a big boy?
Maybe you don't have to pee. I oughta just give you some beer. Goes right through you.
Wonderful. And while we're at it, we can light up a doobie and watch porn.
Until then, you shall continue to sanitise my crevasse and be damn grateful for the opportunity-starting right...
I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he bends a French biscuit on the conveyor belt?
Look, I... I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.
Doubt that. I've got a very comfortable life. I live with a great family, my needs are met.
OK, look, so maybe this isn't where I thought I was gonna be at seven years old.
Judy has an inoperable brain tumour the size of my fist, and that just happens to be Glen's fetish.
Like most other people, I used to think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs.
Hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to lead normal, successful lives.
He suggested I go out into the world and pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.
I know Stacey isn't your mother, but upside-down face or not, you have to respect her!
Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose, but maybe we should consider... crating.
Drop it. Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual happen to trigger it?
I don't wanna have to live with plastic on the furniture like some Italian family.
And to this day I still lay awake at night wondering about the soup that got away.
Sex-some people have it anonymously. What kind of person would do that? you might ask.
I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs.
Watch as I have sex with this potentially dangerous man, as we take you in-depth and undercover.
Oh, by the way, nice rap. I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile.
So I went to the mall, and you're not gonna believe it-they both showed up!
Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting, glow of sensuality that surrounds you.
Lois... did your heart ever want to ask something but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be?
Sometimes we should cherish what we already have, like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share, that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world.
To be clear-we were talking about me being in love with you and you rejecting me, right?
I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards right, I've got seven years ahead of me.
There are a lot of different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was.
So she dumped you, huh? To hell with her. She'll probably end up with some idiot.
It's fall. The time of year when the leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.
Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they are choosing this year's theme.
Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog.
And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: The episode of Who's the Boss? ...where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower.
Swing and a miss. It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her...
Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.
But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss.
Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots I just want to crack you with a cue stick.
And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none were half the man you are.
Since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure.
I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing.
Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood and clipped onto it is a list of this year's float entries.
Why don't you sit next to my baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support.
Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!
If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the time you could do it yourself, like the law says you should.
What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
Combine one small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman.
And this is a chair. That's a lamp. You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!
Do you have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode?
This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks.
You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on.
And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who in turn sells them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family.
Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on!
Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound but if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
If it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived.
Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living?
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist.
But what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had.
Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay.
Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?
Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.
Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids.
I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long...
I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names.
No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl.
Let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not particularly proud of.
After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years.
Hey, Death, you got a file on me? Yeah, it's in the car, I think.
Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you?
You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers l'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire.
Now that I've been given another chance l'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing.
Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear.
You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this?
I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone
You guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: Aren't you Richard Simmons?
Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. I really wanted to be a wood nymph.
Man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: I have no son. I have no son, and Mom just stood there.
Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV.
I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die.
Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed?
Yeah! I've thought about it, like in church and stuff but I don't think I could ever do what you do.
I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done.
Yeah, about that I was pretty sure I was gonna die because there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious.
You're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone?
I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids.
I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice.
If you're going to be in L.A. And would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen!
Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA.
If you look out the window, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn.
We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes. We like being alive, we like being alive We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive
If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays other than the fine programs on Fox.
What are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world!
Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black star of such films as Nashville and Five Easy Pieces, was on board.
Hats off to Miss Black for proving once again that, given the opportunity actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
It was a moving scene today at Hatch Pond as six members of the Pawtucket fire department struggled valiantly to save a fish's life trapped under the frozen ice.
Rescue workers got the fish out of the water but unfortunately it died shortly after.
Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players passed away this afternoon.
Kimble was a hands-on director who often appeared in his own shows most recently, Miss Saigon. La la la la la, Miss Saigon La la la la la, Miss Saigon
This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players.
All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off.
Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive.
Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.
Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board may I present this year's hottest toy Mr. Zucchini Head.
Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think.
I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser.
Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine.
I think Lois is saying that you have to find a way to express yourself creatively.
It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal...
It works! Look how tiny they are! Oh, no not in springtime summer, winter, or fall No, never would I leave you at all
And that note you gave me, louder, I was thinking that, and then you said it.
Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York.
Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: I'm going to kill you!
Five, six, seven, eight. Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition Met the greatest earthquake ever known High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft And plunged them down a thousand feet below to the Land of the Lost
Before I post the cast list my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning.
I only wish the show was called The King and Us so I could cast you all.
Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once but then we later found out it wasn't actually her.
It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.
I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there.
I'm presenting Peter Griffin presents The King and l a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story.
For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn?
Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I.
In other news, I'm not going to the play because I'm sure it'll be lousy.
Action! Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him. Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him.
On Springer yesterday, they had I won't share my husband and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts.
You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber!
And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes!
I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that!
Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming.
I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m.
The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M is exactly what you've turned my show into.
Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life.
I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready!
It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her!
Someone radiant and sassy with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression.
If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night?
If I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?
I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny.
I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all-female sex orgy.
I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America. ANNA rules Because I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels ANNA won Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun Dance and shout 'He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt Though they tried to defeat me they can all just freakin' eat me Because he blew all of us away In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay
This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland!
But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is well, he's gotta be creative.
Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year.
Pawtucket Patriot beer. If you buy it, hot women will have sex in your back yard.
Of course a man made it. It's a commercial, Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
I knew there was a catch. You have to sit through an awful time-share presentation.
A small price to pay. I'm gonna be the first one on Spooner Street to have his own boat.
Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy on Spooner Street to get a boat.
These wonderful homes on this beautifully secluded island can be yours with almost no strings attached.
That's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a woman, you'll do something stupid, like buy that time-share, or not realise I taped over our wedding video with soft-core porn.
Look, the only reason I got myself arrested was to find out what happened to my sister.
Oh, my God, Peter. I sent a copy of that tape to my great-aunt Lil.
Mr and Mrs... Griffin. If you sign this contract without reading it, I'll take your blank cheque, and you won't not be not loving your time-share before you know it.
We'll take the box. We'll take the box. You gave up a boat for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.
That's called starboard. But I'll forgive you cos you sex me up. Now give me some sugar.
Hey, Quagmire, maybe the comedian will tell some jokes about boats or boating or owning a boat.
Boating's in my blood. Ever since my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin, rafted down the mighty Mississippi.
This comic sucks! He couldn't make me laugh even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it. Huh?
Oh, well, pardon me for thinking a microphone stand in a comedy club should tell a joke or two.
OK, OK. How many dirty, stinking apes does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Three. One dirty, stinking ape to screw in the light bulb, and two dirty, stinking apes to throw faeces at each other.
Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman who takes for ever to cook breakfast?
As a matter of fact, if you were any slower at cooking, you'd... well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
They laughed because it looked like you peed yourself, not because they liked your jokes.
Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very edgy, but an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.
If you cooked any more slowly, you wouldn't need an egg timer, you'd need an egg calendar! Ha-ha-ha!
First of all, if I can speak in my own defence, all I did was tell a little joke.
In fact, a film on employee relations has been a mandatory part of our personnel training for 50 years.
Be sure to tell them how good they look every day, even if they're homely and unkempt.
You know, if I wasn't so sure you were a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.
You are a valued member of our business team and every bit as important to this company as I am.
You're a valued member of our business team and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without a shirt on.
A week at a women's retreat. What the hell am I supposed to learn from that?
That's a bad mud puddle. I wouldn't want you to step in that and get your nice shoes all ruined.
You know I love you, but I have to admit there are times when I wish you were a little more sensitive.
I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here to get in touch with his feminine side.
OK, OK, so here's what I'm thinking. I'll be Charlie and you can all be my angels.
It's like taking your bottom lip and stretching it over your head to the back of your neck.
Hey, you wanna hear some horror stories, what about what I went through when Lois was pregnant?
OK, ladies. I'm gonna start with a Greg Louganis triple Salchow and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half...
I really appreciate all the hard work you did giving birth and mothering our kids.
Peter, I'm sure you would have been a great mother if you'd had the chance.
Oh. Oh, this is just great. Now my own wife is forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?
Fine. But this time if a boy calls, please don't tell him I'm wrist-deep in poopie.
Honey, I'm glad you discovered your feminine side, but I didn't want you to forget about mine.
It was refreshing at first, but now... well, he doesn't even treat me like a woman any more.
Anyways, Glen, I was wondering if you and Cleveland could help change Peter back to the way he was.
I can't respect men. Men are the reason our world is in such lousy shape.
Excuse me. I'd like to say a couple of truths to the men in this audience.
It's your fault we have so much crime in this country and it's your fault we have so much violence in this country.
Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta write. The View should be on for three hours.
Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are gonna whip it out and see whose is bigger.
Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile toward someone who's fighting so a woman like you can become more than just a housewife.
I choose to be a wife and mother. And now I'm choosing to end this conversation.
It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy
After I get a little bit of courage from my old friend, Mr. Jack Daniels.
He failed a class, it's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that Thanksgiving when I was 19.
Bryant and Greg have the kind of father-son relationship I want me and Chris to have someday.
I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble. If you don't put Coach back on the air, I'll be really upset. The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson will be missed a lot. Signed, Peter Griffin.
Okay, we're gonna get our show back on the air and were not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types.
And in gridiron news, little Johnny Gobraun a terminally ill 8-year-old who dreamed of playing quarterback for New England got his wish today thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.
Chris, I just thought of a way to get the Gumbels back on the air.
All he wants is his favorite show back on TV. How can you say no?
But these days, people who donate money to our foundation demand a little more bang for their buck.
I've two more kids, and I've always wanted to see new episodes of Star Trek.
That was just a little white lie we came up with to save a TV show.
What the hell is that? Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog Chris Griffin, you're so brave There's a smile on your face and a bounce in your step as they dig your grave as they dig your grave
Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!
Peter, why are these people here? As they dig my grave, as they dig my grave
We just came by to see if your son's taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.
Mr. Griffin, the foundation held up its end of the bargain and got that crappy Gumbel show back on the air!
I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have to die and best of all, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.
Anyone who wouldn't pretend their own son is dying to get the Gumbels back on TV is a racist.
It's bad enough to lie to your family but how can you let these people think you're a healer?
From the cats who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft and Black Kramer v. Kramer, comes a funky flick so bad you gonna say, Damn, that's funky.
I still don't know how every light bulb could go out at the same time.
There was a power surge, you don't bathe and Chris has had acne problems since the fourth grade.
The kids were all calling him Crisco and Pizza Face and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry. Remember, Chris?
I'm just a big fake like the moon landing and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman!
Hey, Dad, I can see a white light at the end of a long tunnel.
Yes, son, and there's no reruns or commercials and Kirstie Alley is still hot and all those scrambled channels come in clear as a bell.
lt seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV but where are those good, old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you all the things that make us laugh 'n' cry He's a family guy l say, Rupert, these crumpets you've prepared look positively divine!
And l suppose the bilious curds you force-fed me from your teat were perfectly fine then?
So the square of a hypotenuse, which we will label C making the sides opposite both of the acute angles A and B always equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.
Even if winning means spending time out of the house and away from my family.
Mr. Griffin, l'm afraid l have bad news. l caught your son peeking into the girls' locker room.
So what's the big deal? lt's normal for a boy his age to be curious. l remember when l first noticed girls starting to develop.
If you have any questions about your Iocker assignments or your cIass scheduIe, pIease come...,
Why don't you go say hello? l'm gonna drop off some campaign flyers in the teachers' lounge.
This campaign literature must be posted today to get you into office and out of my life, you festering strumpet!
Today at Buddy Cianci Junior High, an egg drop conducted by teacher RandaII Fargas seems to have gone horribIy wrong,
Tom, the eggs being dropped behind me are not chicken eggs but those of the endangered CaIifornia condor,
I'm getting word that the Quahog SchooI Board has just dismissed RandaII Fargas, ending his 32-year teaching career,
In other news, Betsy Lebeau, SchooI Board President candidate announced today she's puIIing out of the race,
Great. You can get Mr. Fargas his job back. l'm sorry! But l do have a mind of my own!
And l happen to agree with the School Board's decision. l know you're a feminist and l think that's adorable but this is grown-up time and l'm the man. l'm not giving that lunatic his job back and that's final.
Lois, l can't let you deprive our children of a fine teacher like Mr. Fargas. l'm gonna stop you the only way l can by killing you in the race for School Board President!
Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap and if running against you is the only way to get him back then l am gonna run like the Six Million Dollar Man.
But l'm warning you, l'm not gonna pull any punches on the issues. l'm Lois.
Don't just sit there! l have misbehaved! l've been a bawdy little monkey! lf that vile woman were here, she'd prove a worthy adversary.
Don't sweat it, the Griffin men have always been winners dating back to my diminutive great-grandfather, Juarez Griffin.
Fellas, the debate's in the bag, all right? lf there's one thing l can do, it's play to a crowd.
Tonight she takes on her greatest chaIIenge, Peter Griffin Quahog's native son, seIf-described Huguenot, don't know what that means and community activist,
So fasten your seat beIts, We're just minutes away from Lois versus Peter, Griffin versus Griffin on Monday Night Debate, y'aII! Of suns and worlds l nothing had to say l see mankind's self-torturing pains
When you read Faust you're supposed to do Mephistopheles in a scary voice like this! ls that the way Mommy reads it? l do not miss that ogress.
Damn! l've grown accustomed to her face She almost makes the day begin l've grown accustomed to the tune that she whistles night and noon Her smiles, her frowns, her ups, her downs are second nature to me now Like breathing out and breathing in l'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget, rather like a habit one can always break And yet, l've grown accustomed to her looks Accustomed to her voice Accustomed to her face
This is Iife, the one you get, so go and have a baII because the worId don't move to the beat of just one drum,
You take the good, you take the bad you take them both, and there you have my opening statement,
That's why, if I'm eIected, I promise to fight for competent teachers a better-funded music department and updated textbooks that don't refer to the CiviI Rights Movement as troubIe ahead,
As a rich coIIege-bound student, I once joined some underpriviIeged youths in saving a community center from being converted into a shopping maII,
They deserve a schooI board president who doesn't Ieave their feminine ointments in the fridge next to the mustard! That was the worst hot dog I ever ate!
So ask yourseIf what kind of future wiII it be if you eIect a man who has never taught a student or even been to a PTA meeting,
Peter! Come on! Stop, Shut up! You guys shut up! l didn't enjoy humiliating Peter, but what choice did l have?
But pictures are better than words because some words are big and hard to understand,
Sorry, Lois, Lewd, obscene, and a little blurry just some of the words used to describe Lois Griffin's prurient pic.
Yesterday, voters overwhelmingly declared that Lois Griffin is not the kind of person they want running their schools.
Lois, l got a joke for you. How many losers does it take to make me breakfast?
Winning was only half the battle. lf you blow this chance to do something good for our kids you'll be the biggest loser!
Peter Griffin is no loser! When l'm through with our schools our students'll be so smart they'll be able to program their VCRs without spilling piping hot gravy all over myself.
For starters, we're making sex education more fun. Vagina junction, what's your function? Taking in sperm and spitting out babies
And our schools are the safest around thanks to the hall monitor XL-K. HaIt! Present haII pass!
But.... Right here! Security breach! l guess Little Miss Free Spirit will think twice before roaming the halls. l've restocked our school library with books of some of our greatest movies and TV shows.
Because if we don't teach our kids to read, how will they ever know what's on?
There's quite a crowd outside. l haven't witnessed pandemonium like this since Ridiculous Day down at the deli when prices were so low they were ridiculous.
Your only chance of surviving this scandal is to claim that Lois gave your boy the pornography.
And he's right. Pin it on the old ball and chain. l can't do that. Lois is mad enough at me without.... l'm sorry. l can't look at you! l mean, l can handle ugly. But this is like circus ugly.
We now take you live to Peter Griffin Junior High where embattled School Board President Peter Griffin is fighting for his political life.
Mom, what are you doing here? l thought you were mad at Dad. l am. l just came to see him twist in the wind.
Oh, honey. Maybe. A parent giving porno to their kid is a terribIe thing... ...but I'm here to teII you that I'm innocent!
Crap, Look, my wife, Lois, is the most important person in the worId to me,
And so ends a dark and shameful chapter in the history of Quahog, Rhode lsland.
In tonight's episode, the part of Brian the dog will be played by Carter Banks.
Oh. Oh, God, sorry. Can you give me the line again? Not the whole line, just the end of it.
Bob's Funland and Putt Putt Golf! The grown-up in me likes the prospect of fun.
This is my rifle, this is my gun This is for fighting, this is for fun
Let me give you a tip, pally. The shortest distance between two points is the full-body-English high-arcing rainbow shot.
So we're not goin' just cos some little pissant tells us to. I demand to see the owner.
That's right. This place is my legacy. So what have you done with your life, you jerk?
I don't get it. I poured it in her drink. ...name was Steve Rock. First black I ever did it with.
Ooh, sorry, chief. Seems he already sold his soul in 1976 for Bee Gees tickets.
No, no, no. I mean that painting. I must have it for my gallery in SoHo.
Don't feel bad, Chris. I didn't even want it. Now we all get a free trip to New York cos Mr Monatti thinks you could be a famous artist.
Lois, our son has been blessed with a great gift, and I'm gonna do everything I can to nurture that talent and help him succeed.
Then I'll use him to live out all my frustrated hopes and dreams, because that's good parenting, right, Bing Crosby?
Right, Peter. And if your kids give you any lip, you can beat 'em with a sack of sweet Valencia oranges.
They won't leave a bruise, and they'll let 'em know who's boss. There's no doubt about it.
I'll take this belt off and put the smack-down on you. Is that what you want? Huh?
Hi, this is David Leisure. You probably remember me as the neighbour from TV's Empty Nest.
Oh, kids, look at that man over there, grabbin' his own crotch. Oh! So alive, this city!
New York has some of the best restaurants in the world. They even have Indian food here.
My son's gonna be the best thing to happen to New York since Mayor Giuliani had all the homeless secretly killed.
Screw the theatre. Mr Monatti invited us to a cocktail party so Chris can meet some artists.
It's at the Museum of Modern Art. Oh, God. I hope that's not some kind of museum.
Please, I invited you so that Chris could make an impression on the art community.
Why not do some sightseeing? If you leave Chris in my hands, the name Griffin
So, you see, it's up to you, son. If you don't wanna disappoint your father, keep him away.
There's my boy! Hey, come on, Chris. Let's go to Barneys and fart in the suits.
Mr Griffin, he's going to be a great artist. He now belongs to the public.
Oh, and, um, don't say anything bad about her, cos she might be here right now.
That dump is our home. Dump? Oh, so now you're too good for us, too?
But promise me, when you make it big, you'll let me take advantage of all the...
You know what a pain in the ass it is to get across town, this time of day? Huh?
I have to go oil up and start squeezing into my leather pants. Excuse me.
Wait a second. I don't see any strippers passing out free tacos. Lois, you lied to me!
Oh, for someone with no breasts, you've done very well for yourself. Good for you!
I guess I was wrong about you. You're no artist. You're just a no-talent punk.
Now hold on a second. You can talk to my daughter that way, but not my son.
Dad, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be a famous artist you can mooch off of.
Ah, that's OK, kids. So I don't have my name on an amusement park, and maybe I'll never be famous.
That's right. I guess when it comes right down to it, you're a pretty lucky...
Well, Bob Funland may have his name on the sign, but only a Griffin has this.
I'm going to sex you up so crazy, yeah! Oh, you're loving this, aren't you?
All right, we're gonna use a fan brush here. I want you to take some hunter green, and we're gonna put a happy little bush down here in the corner.
It was 360 years ago that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket set sail for the new colony of Rhode Island.
You know what I'm gonna do when we get to shore? First, I'm gonna have a snack.
But, as legend has it,  he was saved by a magic clam, who brought him to shore and shared the vision of a new colony, which would be called Quahog.
There are fields for tilling, woods for timber, and always the bounty of the sea.
Miles never spoke again. But every year until his death - from a combination of tuberculosis and a tomahawk to the head - he went to the shore on this day in hopes that the magic clam would return.
It's such an honour to play the magic clam. Aren't you proud of your dad, kids?
A pubescent herd of gabby wretches prattling on about boys and music and jellybeans and stickers...
Hey, any of you guys want a soda? I'm gonna go inside and get a soda.
All right, Meg, I need you to boil some water. Girls, I'm gonna need towels. Lots of 'em.
Look, I'll make it up to you. I'll get you Davy Jones for your school dance.
If you care about me, you won't show your faces for the rest of the night.
You ask me out to the box social or whatever the devil it is you children do these days.
I wish there was some way I could make them understand how embarrassing they are.
Man, this is a great show. They drag these idiots up on stage and then blindside 'em.
I can't believe you'd do this to us, Meg. Maybe now I won't give you the antidote.
If you want an autograph, you either gotta give me a pen or get me some snow.
I look at you and I see a series. We would like to put cameras in your house and follow the drama that is your family. Kinda like The Real World.
Yes, Chris. Your father signed a contract, and now we're gonna be on TV for the next six months.
I... I find the toothpaste with a pump is a little easier to get on the brush.
It's just there's always been a lot of tension between Lois and me, and it's not so much that I want to kill her, it's just I want her not to be alive any more.
I sometimes wonder if all women are this difficult, and then I think to myself My God! Wouldn't it be marvellous if I turned out to be a homosexual?
Oh, my God, it is them! I can't believe the Griffins eat here like everyday people.
Meg, honey, it's very cold in here. Maybe you'd be more comfortable with your bib on.
Why not? Our research shows that Meg is the least popular character on the show.
But everyone loves the rest of you. Lois, women 25 to 49 see you as a role model.
No cameras. The TV executives don't want viewers to be confused and think you're Meg.
I have an announcement. Meg Griffin's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors.
I'll be at Cleveland's house. I don't wanna be a part of this family any more.
We could offer you the guest room, provided that it doesn't bother you that my Great Uncle Chet died in there.
You know, some people think that dandelions are weeds, but, uh, you know, I always think... who the hell decided tulips were so great?
Uh, I don't know if Mom and Dad told you, but we usually have breakfast naked and I'm allowed to videotape it.
I didn't make cheerleader because I'm so plain, and I still don't have a date for Friday night, as usual.
I'm going to write in my journal about how I'll never grow big, full breasts like these.
It's not fair. If I don't get any airtime, how am I ever gonna get my own spin-off where I'm a retired baseball umpire who opens a bar?
To hell with the cameras. How could we ever let them replace our little girl?
Me too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother who isn't as good-Iooking or successful and never answers my letters, but he's still a Baldwin, dammit, and so is Meg.
Fire that sexy, interesting version of our daughter and make us a family again, or we walk.
I think it's awful and I don't much care for it at all, my good sir.
Well, you put me in a very awkward position, Peter, but I guess I have no choice.
This is terrible! We're the laughing stock of the town and we've lost our daughter.
Dad, if bad men broke into the house, and they had guns, and they put a gun up to your head and made you choose who you wanted to live, me or Meg, who would you choose?
It's hard enough having Stewie all the way in Palm Springs visiting Grammy and Grandpa.
Lois, uh... I was thinking. Why don't I fly out to Palm Springs and pick up Stewie?
OK, Lois. I'll make you a deal. We'll watch the tape, but you gotta do something for me.
You were watching the boys again. It's that steward, the one who looks like Tab Hunter.
Oh, come on, Lois. This is gonna be worse than when we had to watch your Uncle's Jerry's snuff film.
I'd like to start by asking the women to leave the room, because this part of the tape is for men only. We'll see you in a little while.
I hope you like big breasts because mine are so big, this itty bra can barely contain them.
Oh, come on, you. Get up. Come on! Go for a ride in the car.
And, well, it's kinda like a bat. I found it out back one day when I was raking.
If Montgomery Clift, who was in From Here to Eternity with Burt Lancaster, who was in Atlantic City with Susan Sarandon, who was in White Palace with Kevin Bacon. There.
And if there's a pilot, there must be a bar. I can get a drink.
You can trust us completely. My friend is too young to put a seed in your daughter's belly
Boy, will your face be red when they find the black box on this one.
So saturate the soil twice a day. That's why my tomatoes haven't been coming in.
That was pretty good. But when you said Me llamo es Brian,  you don't need the es.
All right. So instead of driving down this sun-parched highway, we've now got to walk.
Yes, and I bet you lost your virginity to a mechanical bull. Now change me!
Brian, your momma gave you up because she thought you'd have a better life if she let you go.
This is actually a rather elegant solution for my problem of what to do with Lois.
These tapes are about communication. If you wanted to see a woman acting nasty... you shoulda told me.
I'm gonna get directions to the nearest park so we can give my mother a proper burial.
And God said Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better? Jerry, pull the high end out. I'm still getting some hiss back.
I never knew Biscuit as a dog, but I did know her as a table.
Listen, there's something I've been meaning to tell you. It's not easy for me to say.
Like two college freshmen who were rejected by Harvard and forced to go to Brown.
Hey, kid! Thanks for not ratting me out. Is there anything I can do to pay you back?
Oh, yes. You remember that episode of The Brady Bunch where Bobby saved Greg's life,
It's on this afternoon. You can tape it for me. And put a nice label on it.
I finally get Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night.  It's a comedy that's too good to be funny.
In local news, a new drug craze may have Quahog students licked. It's called toad.
Peter, may I? You're walking down a hallway. You take a left. You keep walking.
Oh, now, don't you try to palm this off on your sister. She's a good girl.
What's going on back here? Oh, hello, Megan. Wait, you're not part of the popular clique.
Run along and play alone somewhere. Shame on you all, getting her hopes up like that.
I thought if I held Connie's toad, she'd make one of the cool guys ask me to the Snow Ball.
We all did it. If you want to be a Supreme Court justice, you gotta pick up that cherry with your butt cheeks and drop it in that beer.
Uh, I was wonderin' if... if... if you'd, uh, d-do me the honour of, uh...
Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take to get to the centre of a Rhode Island state prison?
I mean, if Meg's at risk, then so is Chris, and Stewie'll be in preschool before we know it.
Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to us as parents to be a part of the solution.
But... you didn't tell me anything. You just sat down and said And that's my plan.
I love it! You have the faculty's full support. But how will you pull it off?
I've gone undercover to get rid of the toad problem, so your school can be safe and innocent like the good old days.
God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and this is all just a side effect from the chemo.
No relation. So, tell me, homeboy, how 'bout the baggy clothes we kids are wearin'?
You know what I got for Christmas? It was a banner year at the Tiger house.
I got a carton of cigarettes. Old man grabbed me, said Hey, smoke up, Tony. They're grrreat! Bastard.
Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser, how come I'm going to the Snow Ball with Lando?
This is great. Not only did I live long enough to see Meg go to her first dance, but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.
And it's a lot safer now that all the kids have guns. And today in study hall,
I farted real loud on purpose to make the guys laugh, and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie Johnson ralphed up her Salisbury steak.
I'm glad you taught those kids they don't have to do drugs to be popular.
He sure did! Who needs drugs when you go to the dance with the coolest guy in school?
It's true. Soon members of the math club will be attaching themselves to your underbelly.
Mother, this could almost have passed for a palatable banana pudding, but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one of your wretched culinary abortions!
Oliver Twit,  if you ask me. I would have done things rather differently, I can tell you that.
All right. Stop it. Stop it right there. Now, go on, fill up the bowl.
Hey, Connie pulled a power move. When the most popular girl in school asks you to the dance, you don't say no, you say Haba-haba-haba... OK.
When I try to speed things up in bed, I'm not thinkin' of Connie, I'm thinkin' of Phoebe.
Me? I did a lot of drugs, married some broad named Cher... and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.
Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you. And, you know, you could still go to the dance.
Alone? Why don't I just tattoo a big L on my forehead while I'm at it?
If you stay home, you're just proving to the other kids that you don't belong there.
Don't worry, I'll take good care of your kid. I got a daughter of my own, you know.
I convinced Meg to go to the dance, so I'm gonna go drop her off.
Lois, if you still haven't discovered I'm gone,  please flip the tape over to side B.
Ri... No, no, no, to the left. No, no, you had her. No, no, go back, go back.
You got a monkey workin' the spotlight. No, to the right, genius. Th-there. Stop. Stop.
That's my dream girl. But I'm not good enough for her and she dumped me.
So now, heartbroken, I will ride recklessly into the night and up Dead Man's Curve.
And Lando Griffin,  a popular student at a local high school, was killed last night when his motorcycle careened off Dead Man's Curve.
Police were baffled when no body was found,  but they decided not to ask questions and just let everyone get on with their lives.
Now give me the other half of the amulet. I don't think you'll be making it to Marrakech.
I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get the sifter so we can build our sand village.
Oh, he's fine. You know, I was quite a troublemaker myself when I was a kid.
Your parents'll be home any minute. Are you sure you don't want me to clean up?
I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick, a can of beans and a pocketful of dreams.
Gladys, it took me two hours to work up the courage to rent this porno.
OK, Mommy's leaving you here for a while. Try to play nice with the other children.
Mom, you can't get a job. The last time you left Dad home alone, he turned the house into a giant puppet.
Uh... If you get a job, who's gonna feed me and protect me from the evil monkey in my closet?
The zipper's been broken for over a month. I gotta use a damn safety pin.
If Lois is lookin' for a thrill, I could get her a job with the airline.
No, of course not. You're living the clean life now. It's that pathetic little insect in daycare.
Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind at all. What the deuce has come over me?
Look at her, Leonard, sitting there with her curly ebony locks and those pouty come-hither lips. My God, she's unappealing.
So let it be known I want absolutely nothing to do with the wretched enterprise of love!
No, no, actually, it's Stewie, but, well, you can call me Cookie if you like.
Yes. I... Yes, I've also been known to answer to Artemis, Agent Buchwald and Snake.
Yes. Yes. Yes, you'II... you'll get that one halfway back to your mat. Ha! Ha... Oh, God.
You know, the usual. How about yours, my little sky princess? Bet it was excitin'.
Well, I guess I'll give it a little more time. It's like I always tell the kids -
You know, it's odd, Janet, but when I'm with you, I... Oh, how do I describe it?
Ha! I said Will you be my wife? You said yes, so it is official. Let me touch your face.
OK. Everyone? It's time for my one-man show - Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye.
Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the way to Kentucky to get some fried chicken, and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?
My wife is a stewardess, so I can fly anywhere and I don't pay jack!
You convinced me to keep a job I hate just so you could fly free?!
If I talked real loud like that, I could make you look like the bad guy.
My feet are killing me, I've got vomit in my pocket and I've seen that crappy Julia Roberts movie 47 times!
Have you seen the lips on that woman? It's like a baboon's ass on her face!
Peter, I took this job for the excitement, and you're the one who's havin' it all!
Oh, it's excitement you want, huh? Well, how'd you like to join the Mile High Club?
Come on. You be the stewardess, and I'll be the mysterious stranger who's drillin' you.
Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over. The plane has safely landed in Cuba, and all Americans aboard are on their way home, except one couple - a fat man who is inexplicably married to an attractive redhead.
I called Brian. He's gonna watch the kids till we get back. When will our passports arrive?
We would have sent you with the others, but we didn't know you were stuck in the toilet.
Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies. There'll be dancing, Christmas mornings, and arguments over the proper way to discipline the children, and...
Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm the only one in this thing, I deserve to know.
Yes, it seems she's, um... Oh, what did we figure out, dear? Was it one? No, two. Yes.
She's two weeks younger than you. Just look at that butt. That is a tight butt.
This is what you call dolled up? Why don't you save yourself years of sexual ambiguity and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?
I was lyin', but just so you know it's somethin' we might have to deal with.
It's just a word used by Madison Avenue to sell their skin creams and two-seater cars.
I'm sorry I tricked you into that job, honey. You deserve to have a more excitin' life.
I mean, look at us-on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, under the moonlight, surrounded by refugees.
Miguel over there has had his eye on you, and his wife Rosa is very open.
I had rehearsal for Death of a Salesman,  but we can't show death at school, so now at the end, we dance around with sparklers.
Oh, no, Lois. A guy at work bought a car outta the paper. Ten years later, bam! Herpes.
There's no way we can have maritals with you lying all the way over there.
OK, so I tried on your bra. Jeez, the fellas were puttin' on a show.
I didn't think I'd make a good Gigi either, but, God help me, I was flattered.
Ha! You're just mad about the car. Don't worry. I'll think of a way to fix it.
I'm just sayin' that me and my associates will steal your car, and ipso facto your insurance company'll buy you another one.
Dharma, come down from there. Wow,  I can't get over what a free spirit you are.
Lois, can you go down to the basement and do somethin' really loud and complicated for the next 15 minutes?
Look, Lois, we had a broken car, I did something, and now we have a new car.
Well, the important thing is it matters to you. And that's the greatest gift of all.
That's fancy an' all. But I think you're bargainin' for more than you can chew.
You're in debt to the Mob. That means they can ask you to do anything.
No, no. I mean, am I George Carlin funny, am I Spin City funny, Rita Rudner funny, what? Come on.
Whaddaya gonna make me do? Whack a guy? Off a guy? Whack off a guy?
Silence. Big Fat Paulie's in town this week to attend the wedding of my daughter.
No one's been able to stand Big Fat Paulie's company for more than a minute.
That's it? That's all I have to do? Ah, thank Go... Wait a second. Which movie?
Because if it's anything with Greg Kinnear, you can just whack me off right now.
That'd be better than having dinner with my family who I love and am not afraid of.
You have a pretty good appetite there, kid. I bet you spend a lot of time in the john.
That man is bad news. I want him out of our house and out of our lives.
Ever stare at the night sky and wonder if someone might be lookin' back at ya?
This is my friend, Big Fat Paulie, and, uh... this is his big fat ass.
Aw, jeez. It's not you, it's Lois. She doesn't want me hangin' around with ya.
Willy Loman never made a lot of money, his name was never in the paper, but, uh... You know, like, attention could be paid.
Whaddaya mean, you thought she'd be six feet under and we'd be able to catch a movie?
I was talkin' to Big Fat Paulie the other day and one thing led to another, and...
I say, Jeremy, isn't that Reginald B Stiffworth, the chap who's been touting the merits of a United European Commonwealth?
I've been lookin' all over for ya. Look, I gotta call off the hit on my wife.
Peter, there is no such thing as the Mafia. The don's daughter is getting married tomorrow. Here's my invitation. Now, get the asterisk, percent, ampersand, out of here, you SOB.
Didn't you see The Godfather?  The don can't refuse a favour on his daughter's wedding.
No way, it's too dangerous. I got you into this and I'll get you out of it.
Decent phones, God-fearing phones, phones that everybody else gave up on, but we knew better, because we were a team.
I don't know. What if somethin' happens to ya? I'm too old to start dating again.
I'd invite my friend Rudy over and the two of us would give you a double dip.
Peter, my good friend. How good of you to come and show your respect, on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
Go ahead. I am obligated to grant one favour on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
See, marriage is a partnership. If you really love someone, you gotta work together, as a team. I... I learned that the hard way.
I didn't listen to what my wife had to say and now she's as good as dead.
We won't have to. I don't believe this. She's the one I'm supposed to whack.
This is interminable! I demand to know why you insist on taking me everywhere you go!
Hey, Tom, he's just a fat kid! Aren't you, fatty? You're just a big old fat kid.
Agh! Sorry, Dr Ling, I guess I'm nervous. This whole thing is a little weird.
See, the reason your fleas are drawn to you is your kidney energy is bein' blocked by a dark chi, or what we call in my country wee-fung-chow-hu.
Attention, world leaders. I have 137 nuclear warheads trained on every capital city around the globe.
There's only one thing to do-learn the language of the fleas, earn their trust, then breed with their women. In time our differences will be forgotten.
He just watched his wife and kid get carried away by seven million fire ants.
I feel terrible about this. Why don't I put us up in a nice hotel for a couple of days?
Oh, I see. Cash only, huh? No paper trail. What are you sellin'? Reefer? Crack?
Oh, for God's sake! I'm to entrust my life to a turtle, nature's D student? Agh!
No, you can't swim with your shirt on. Wait a second. What are you hidin'?
Do you have bruises? Did somebody hit you? Lois, what did you do to my son?
Don't listen to him, Chris. I'm gonna go get you a soda. You wait here.
You're not fat, Chris, you just come from a long line of husky Griffins, like your great-great-great-uncle Jabba the Griffin.
Honey, if you wanna lose weight, I'll put you on a diet and your father can help you exercise.
Don't listen to your sister. Stickin' your finger down your throat doesn't make you throw up.
Meat loaf for us, and a very special, very delicious steamed vegetable dish for Chris.
I say, Phineas, great day to be doing squat thrusts and lifting our huge triangular iron weights.
Dad, I don't like running. The sound of my thighs scraping together hurts my ears.
I tell ya, he's been workin' out all week and he hasn't lost a pound.
Peter, if you're this desperate about Chris's weight, why don't you just suck the fat out?
If you can find a hole on the boy that you wanna put your lips on, be my guest.
Well, Nell Carter used to be twice as big before Broderick got through with her.
FYI, he used the fat he took out of her to make the two kids from Good Burger.
I'm like a Green Beret, you know. I sneak inside you and I skulk around like it's Vietnam or somethin', and I'm sneakin' through the bush, you know.
And I get all that fat, like the fat's my buddies stuck behind enemy lines, you know.
I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you, you know, like a... like the wind, you know.
Yes, yes, I got more of it on me than in me. Yes, that one never gets old, Lois.
I'm ready. Well, time for dessert, isn't it? Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie, and we have something very tasty for big fat you. Bon apptit!
Oh, and feel free to use my fork, I shan't be needing it. Watch me.
We should cut down on your sweets-you're gettin' a belly. Chris, where have you been?
Dad took me to a doctor to get the fat vacuumed out of my belly.
I mean, what kinda lazy, narcissistic, irresponsible moron would even consider doing something as unbelievably foolish as getting liposuction? Who, I ask you? Who?
You know, there's somethin' I always wanted to do, Brian, but, uh... I-I could never do it cos I was so heavy.
I was wonderin' if I could put a little saddle on your back and ride you like a horsy.
Your place is here in the ice village. You know nothing of Hollywood and its ways.
But, Father, I have dreams and courage and the name of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.
Fear not, some day word will reach you about the success of me, the great Eskimo actor Jennifer Love Hewitt.
Plastic surgery is great! I was thinkin' about havin' Broderick take a look at my nose.
It doesn't matter if your nose is a little bulbousy, or your eyes are too close together, or your chest is flabby. You are who you are.
You... you've really let this family down. We should be embracin' the things God gave us, not tellin' our kids a person's not as good as someone else because of the way they look.
Here's your introductory basket. It's got lotions, Ferrari sunglasses, and pills to make your bowel movements smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.
Serves you right. You tried to make Chris jealous, now you have an eating disorder.
What the... What the devil are you doing? Stop it! Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!
Lois, I can't say any more. I'm probably already in trouble for mentioning it to a, uh...
Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know, he's become a superficial, egomaniacal jerk.
But I've never been more attracted to him. Does that make me a bad person?
Peter, good to see you. I've got a lot of tall, statuesque people I want you to meet.
Well, let me tell you somethin', buddy. If my son can't come in, then I'll just come in.
Maybe I will. Then I'll put it on my feet and skate on Paul Bunyan's giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!
I can't believe you're all still standin' by my side after what a jerk I was.
What'd you do, sell your body to science? You know, I've thought of doin' that.
All right, uh, Jenny, would you come up here and show us where the femur is?
You can write off medical stuff? If I'd known, I wouldn't have used a discount surgeon.
Uh, I'm not sure which one to cut here. The red one... or the blue one...
Well, Mr Griffin, you don't owe any additional money, but unfortunately, you're not entitled to a refund.
By God, I may not be able to give my family a vibrating sex doll,
If you find a human skeleton with a Lincoln Log jammed in the temple, I didn't do it.
OK, kids, I don't want anyone swimmin' in this pool unless there's a lifeguard on duty.
See, that's what I do. I ask for a snack and I blow the horn.
I've fixed the power line, but the town's zoning laws prohibit building a pool there.
OK. We've narrowed it down to two possible names. All in favour of Bugs Bunny?
I'm here to serve the fine citizens of Quahog. It'll be my pleasure to give you a permit.
I've never encountered anything like this, but your property doesn't seem to be on the map.
Would you come back in a week, when my fat malcontent trap door will be completed?
No, no. We're not part of this city. We're not even part of this country.
I was going to call it Peterland, but that gay bar by the airport took it.
A new foreign country which was founded this week, here in our own back yard.
Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, to Petoria, where first lady Lois Griffin has graciously agreed to give a tour of her country. Tricia.
Thank you, Diane. So, Mrs Griffin, what's it like being the woman behind the man?
Ah, you know, when Peter first said we were our own country, I was a bit sceptical.
Then I thought Hey! I could be like Hillary Clinton! Only, you know, without the penis.
Oh, Peter. That tickles me in a way that if Loretta tickled me in that way,
What are you talkin' about? I'm a born leader. Like my great-great-uncle Ulysses S Griffin.
You think G Gordon Liddy paid for his drinks while he was stranglin' people with piano wire for the good of our nation?
It's Peter, go Peter, up Peter, yo, Peter, let's see Regis rap this way, can't touch me
I'm stuck up here in the nosebleeds. I'm president of Petoria. I want a better seat.
And hey! Would you also like a special satellite to scratch your ass with a laser beam from space?
The only way to get any respect around here is to find something you want and just take it.
Oh, yeah? Well, according to paragraph seven, sentence three, word eight of the Geneva Convention, the.
The scene outside the US-Petorian border as the sun rises on day one of Operation Desert Clam.
Good morning. I'm Diane Simmons. We now go to Tom Tucker, live at the site of the US blockade. Tom?
Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front, where the US has cut off electricity, water and gas to the tiny four-bedroom republic.
Oh, my God, they've opened fire. It looks like things are getting very heated here.
Peter, I'm up here. Oh, sweetie, maybe you should go over to Joe's and return his pool, huh?
No. We're a real country. We deserve all the rights and privileges everyone else gets.
Can anybody tell me what the square root of the hypotenuse is... Chris, is that a note?
Damn you, Rupert! Keep these loathsome insects away, or you'll end up like Mr Giraffe.
A lot of you know me as Tim Robbins' mother. But I'm actually his girlfriend.
For less that the ticket price of one of my movies about capital punishment or neo-feminism, you can make sure that Stewie never goes hungry again.
Look at what we're reduced to. Our own baby has to use newspapers for diapers.
I'm sorry. Were you just whipping me? Or did I just get bit by a mosquito?
Hey, Lois, if you happen to see the dungeon master, tell him his grandmother was tryin' to work me over.
Are you nuts? Look at all these telegrams. Nice goin'. Libya. You the man! North Korea. Great job! Iraq.
Iraq, Lois! You know what? I'm gonna invite a few of these fellas over for a party.
I didn't know what to bring, so I made coleslaw. It's made out of people!
That show is so funny. It really reminds me of me and my friends, how we hang out before I kill them for worshipping the wrong god.
And I love that Kramer guy. He comes in the room like this: Whaaaa... Well, I can't do it, but you know.
I say, I say, Achmed. What is that thing you people do when you're about to assassinate an infidel?
I've had enough. You can keep this filthy mess you call a country. Come on, kids.
Attention, President Griffin. As you may presently, yourself, fully be aware of, my grammar sucks, but more importantly,  we're about to commence
The guy who aims is in the john. Ah, here he is. Next one's comin' right at you.
Face it, it's over. Why not sit down with the mayor and negotiate some kind of treaty?
Can... can I tie you to a stick and use you as a white flag?
Thank you all for coming. We invited Jesse Jackson to open our negotiations with a prayer.
OK. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to make a concession or two.
And that's the story of Petoria, a little nation that, 200 years ago, seceded and repatriated in less than a week.
So, like, can the family understand the baby, or... or... What's the deal with that?
Well, the other day I told Jane her blouse was pretty when it was really pee-ew.
If you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears that would ring a bell.
Yes, this is Meg Griffin. She's here to see the dean of admissions and we'd, uh, like it if she got into the university.
It's got the power to enslave the entire human race. Do we have an opening bid?
I wanted to call her Twiki. But Lois said kids now wouldn't get the reference.
Well, actually, I really wanted to go to Wellesley but Mom said I might as well buy hiking boots and call myself a lesbian right now.
Look, Neil, I need an activity to get into Brown. The paper is my last hope.
OK, I'll give you a shot. I've never been able to get an interview with the mayor.
You seize life by the throat and shake it like a topless bartender mixing a martini.
That's why I started Stewie's Big and Tall Man Shop. If you're portly or tall, you'll find a friendly atmosphere brimming with personalised and expert service.
If I could build a device to harness the size of that leviathan, there's no limit to what I could... Oh, my God, there's an orgy in my mouth. Got milk? That's a funny one too.
Mayor West, you've been talking for an hour and I don't have anything I can use.
It's cost $150,000 of the taxpayers' money but I'll find the culprits if it costs me a million.
Meg needs something that'll pull those kids away from their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots and their Spirographs and their Moby Grape and their 90210.
Now, to get this story on the school editor's desk is gonna take a portion of my cunning.
A lot of these famous types lead secret lives we don't know about. Like Ricky Martin.
Thanks to you I can put that I'm a big liar who makes up stories about people.
Well, I bought him and I've been saving him for a time like this. Surprise!
Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy but I can't help feeling like this is somehow my fault.
Brian, that's it! If I could get a picture of Luke Perry doing something gaylike it'll make people believe Meg's story is true!
Hey, I've gotten people to believe crazier things. And if you are pure of heart and deed you'll all go to a beautiful place called Heaven.
Look here, you gourd-bellied codpiece. Allow me to purchase the provisions I demand or I shall transform your blue collar into a red one and...
Where the hell would I keep it? In my diaper? Get outta here, you hobo!
Listen, Brian, I'd take a bullet for Meg so I'm sure I can take a... Here he is.
Ah, this is gonna take drastic measures. All right, get the camera ready. Oh, Luke!
I can't even say my name without people asking me if I made it up.
He was doing it for you. He knows how much you want to go to Brown.
That scene where you wanted to get on the plane and that dumb guy was screaming.
Come to my house so I can take a picture of you in a gay pose.
Really? Shannen Doherty told me that but I thought she was just being a bitch.
This is all my fault. I was just trying to help my daughter get onto the school newspaper.
We interrupt for breaking news. After years of isolation, the mysterious and eccentric brewmeister, Pawtucket Pat, has said that he's opening his never-before-seen brewery to a lucky few.
Each lucky scroll winner and a guest of their choice will take a magical tour of the brewery, and walk away with a lifetime's supply of beer.
Oh, Lois, thank God it's you. The last three houses I went to were very rude.
You give me the scroll, and I make you head of sanitation services for the entire city.
Everyone has their sanctuary. The Catholics have churches, fat people have Wisconsin, and I have the Pawtucket Brewery.
Oh, no! If there's four tickets and one of 'em's gone, that... that leaves... this many!
Don't let her get to you. She asked for Pine Forest. I gave her New Car.
The recipient declines to be interviewed for safety reasons, but I'm sure you're all with me when I say Congratulations, you son of a bitch.
That's right. I made it up. I figured if people thought the last scroll was found, everyone would stop looking, giving me the edge to find it myself.
In other news, chocolate may be better for you than once thought. In a recent 12-day study...
I was at home nursing this throwing-star wound, my wife Janey gives me a beer, and bam, there it was.
I'm glad I'm not takin' your stupid tour! I'm a Coors man anyway! Silver Bullet!
But then they realised it wasn't my time, and so they sent me back to a brewery.
This beer will still be carbonated long after you die of old age and we buy another dog to help the kids, you know, forget about you.
Me too, buddy. That's why I was holdin' this in, but, if we're gonna die anyway...
Come on, Meg. The competition is this Sunday, and you're not even close to ready.
Lois, take a letter. Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you! You are a bad man! And you made me cry. Furthermore...
Jeez, Lois. Still with the piano? What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here?
Oh, jeez, this hangover's killin' me. I haven't felt this crappy since I went to that museum.
That's not true. I can also vomit, fall down and make dirty calls to your sister when I'm drunk.
You come to me and ask me to kill a man I do not know.
Oh, God knows how many of his brain cells I killed, pourin' all that alcohol down his throat.
Lois, you don't get it. The lesson here is that abusing alcohol has absolutely no negative consequences.
You know I swore I'd never clean again. Not after Bounty dropped me as their spokesman.
Wait a second. Rosie, I've just poured this glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter, and you say that Bounty can pick it up in five seconds?
Well, Lois, why don't you put down your ginger ale and Redbook and get to work?
I wanna go. It'll get me away from the evil monkey that lives in my closet.
Brian, have you lost your mind? He's just a baby. He doesn't know what he's doing.
Marvellous. A quick weigh-in, stick out your tongue, and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.
Good for you, son. Hey, where's Chris? I asked him to fill the canteens an hour ago.
They call this the magic hour: the day's not quite gone, but the night's not quite here, and somewhere, Scott Baio is ploughin' a woman he doesn't love.
Yeah. All we caught was a tyre, a boot, a tin can and this book of clichs.
The raccoons were here. See? We're a bunch of sneaky animals. We're gonna wreck this food and eat it, cos we're naughty! And then there's a guy. Let's get him in trouble with his dad! Ha ha ha!
I'll teach the boy. Come, my son. I'll show you the ways of the herd...
Well, it's just... I've been tryin' to teach Chris how to be a man, you know?
Chris, the way to eat an Oreo is to twist it, pull it apart and lick it.
Oh, you're burnin' up. Must be a reaction to the shots. I'll go get you some baby aspirin.
What are you talking about? You said the shots were supposed to make me healthy.
Pink as a pistol?! Good Lord! I can't even form a cogent simile any more.
Boys, I'm a miracle worker. I have used all my parenting skills to change my son from a lazy slacker into a workin' man.
I sold twice as many buckets today cos everybody wants to hit the fat kid.
Look what I did with Chris. I'm better than that dad on Lost in Space.
Don, you take my 16- year-old blonde daughter out in the chariot for the day.
You and the robot go out into the wilderness and take this mincing paedophile with you.
Drink this, honey. It'll bring your fever down. I'm gonna go run you a cool bath.
She's one of them. I'm sure of it. Tell me what they injected me with!
But I'm tryin' to be a good father here. I'm real proud of you, champ.
Oh. Well, at least you have a dad. When I was growin' up, it was just me and my mom.
This is the perfect way to show what a great father figure I've been to Cleveland Junior.
I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar with my dad. He doesn't have time for me.
We are at the 17th hole, where Peter Griffin and Cleveland Junior are five strokes ahead, making victory all but a certainty.
This is gonna be my greatest victory ever. Except for the time I defeated my evil twin.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I can't even think of a reason to get off the bed in the morning.
I was on a road to destruction, man. The accident may have crippled me, but I'm alive.
I, uh, I notice you got a new receptionist. Nice little body on her, huh?
Hey, John, you got a two-seater. Hey, Derek, maybe you go with John, huh? Huh?
Uh, I think they're lookin' for some witch or something. I don't know. I wasn't listening.
Yeah. One time it almost got me a spokesman deal. Follow your nose.  Follow your nose.  Follow your nose.
I was thinkin' of doin' it, you know, good. Like an actor. But your way's good too.
I guess it's just down to you and me, Peter. One of us is gonna win that paid vacation.
You're back from Manila. You ate lumpia, then you made love to two Filipino women.
It's coke! Yes! All right! We got 'em! This is great. This is the rush I've been lookin' for.
Oh, come on, stop it, you guys. It's nothing. Oh, Lois, your toast is ready.
I must say, I've always dreamed of a life at sea. I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy And your record will stand as proof Be it galley or freighter, I'm an expert navigator And you're also a world-class poof My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue Well, despite your point of view I can thrill a girl or two But I'd rather get it on with you
Un-freakin'-believable. First we nailed a bastard who had the gall to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll. Her doll!
Where's the line any more? I got news for ya. It-it's not even on the radar screen.
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see your reflection in it, and the next day it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway staring back at you, mocking you. Blah! Blah! Blah!
Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.
Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to... Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.
But I heard that if you use tanning beds, you could get something called melanoma.
Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.
Patience. It took St Patrick more than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.
Oh, well... It's not as good as my Irish cop. It's just a little thing I... I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up for it by having a very strong upper body.
The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're gettin' in the mood for our cruise.
Just because you can't feel your teeth doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.
Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to wipe the dried blood from under your nose?
Brian, I know I don't speak up much, and it's really hard for me to talk about my feelings, but...
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.
Brian, how about a little tie music? Peter's tie, Peter's tie That's because Peter's the guy!
But why do we have to cancel our cruise just cos the dog's a cokehead?
We're not going on vacation while Brian's in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.
Our goal here is to find your X factor - the element in your life that made you turn to drugs.
Just having some time away to sort things out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.
Just work with the resistance of the water. Ten more reps. And one. And two.
I've been observing your behaviour. I don't think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.
Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips. In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.
I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess with the pregnant teens across the lake?
I saw one of those - more borin' than when I was a security guard for George Harrison.
I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing one session wouldn't be the end of the world.
Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do. He was all coked up and we were choked up But now we're happy Brian's home, cha-cha-cha!
Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me, you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.
Joe, if I've learned anything from my experience, it's that we're all responsible for our own destiny.
Brian's gone to Los Angeles to find himself. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
You are some piece of work, lady. If you... Actually, yes, it is. Greetings from California. I've been very busy. Having a great time trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot of Hollywood parties.  Oh!
I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.
Yeah. He had a scar on his arm and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.
If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I are going to have a good time together.
That could be the ideal place to unleash my hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.
I always loved this little sailor suit. Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener, and a copy of my coming-of-age teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
You know what we'll do? We'll get the video camera and make our own show.
Interesting question. More to the point, how does one define job without branding oneself with useless labels?
Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood, where people are sexy and clever and always say somethin' funny before the commercial break.
I think it's something I'd be excited to be a part of, so call my...
Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy Phil just found your script at Starbucks.
Well, I was invited to the premiere of the new, uh... the new Val Kilmer picture, but I'd rather take you out to dinner.
It says here this is the gutter where the policeman fell over laughing after Eddie Murphy said he was just giving the transvestite a ride home.
Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp counsellor all the kids wanna get with.
My director quit and I need somebody who's smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.
Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching, that emptiness I felt back home, gone.
I've always found your writing a little hackneyed and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?
Yes, but I was talking about stopping by the set to see me in action.
I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is absolutely no way I would consider doing it.
Peter, slow down. Brian said he was gonna be on the set all day. On the set! Listen to me. Two days in Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.
Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try giving the lines a little subtext this time.
Your husband's always away on business and you feel isolated and unloved, so you begin to think maybe you should go back to graduate school.
All right, Samuel, when you lay her down, I want you to enter from... Oh, my God!
Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning.
Sorry. I thought the name of the show was Kids Say the Darndest Things, not Old Black Comedians Never Shut the Hell Up.
Enough of your blether. Good evening, world. From this moment on, I will be your...
We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta who skips rope with her sister's pigtails.
I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.
The next award is for Best Original Score in an adult film. The nominees are: Ron Jones.
My God. I thought I needed to get away from you guys to find what was missing in my life, but the only thing I'm missing is my family.
I wanna thank my incredible team, who've been with me from Shaving Private Ryan to Welcome to my Face.
You got a nice wiggle, baby. You wanna be in a movie? A little girl-girl action maybe?

It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot when I was pregnant with you?
Louie left his house at 2.15 and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of five miles per hour. What time will Louie arrive?
I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire family was killed and I am a vegetable.
Hold on to this. It'll be a souvenir of your first Major League game with your Dad.
Me, too. Maybe we can get on TV if we take our shirts off and run onto the field.
I want him to treat me like a deluxe one from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw.
What do you call it when a guy in middle management moves to upper management?
I told you we're not starting without your father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.
Hey, family, anyone in the mood for lobster? Ow! Oh, God! One of them has my pupil!
Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see eight-year-old kids driving. They're fun toys.
What about that graph on the wall that says The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.
Huh. Then what about that poster that says The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking.
I mean, would you really be the president of a company that didn't care about kids?
Some company hired me to stand next to you all day, so you'd look better.
But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean.
I take back all the bad things I said about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.
A little chicory perks up the taste of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.
Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr Griffin. You have an executive parking space now.
So what's this big assignment you got for me, chairman of the broad? Chairman of the broad. When did you become such a stitch?
Don't you remember? You gave me writers. I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go 'Whoopee!'
We need someone important like you to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what fun-loving people the tobacco industry's made of.
And that's when Clarence Thomas forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures.
We have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state.
I'll show 'em a good time and get 'em to come around to our side.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.
You may have killed her when you shoved all those dollar bills down her throat.
You may have killed her when you hit her with the stool. I'm not a doctor.
Look, kids. Here's your father in People magazine with Jim Carrey, and they're both Sssmokin'!
Ah. They call me Bill Yes, they call me Bill And I'm standing here on Capitol...
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am here today to talk to you about smoking.
I propose we send a message to tobacco companies by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company infinity billion dollars!

So I told my boss I'm not staying in that stupid toy factory. I'm gonna go places.

Here's to The Drunken Clam, where they don't ask for proof of age and neither do I.
Are you sure? I-I think I did. All right, well, just to be safe... Oh!
And people's parents will throw faecal matter down on them from the rooftops. How awful!
Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep the hurricane's gonna sneak up and give me a vasectomy.
Hurricane Norman is about to pound Quahog. We go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa to see how locals are dealing with the imminent disaster. Tricia?
Gotcha! See, kids? Disasters have their lighter sides too. You just have to be creative.
Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theatre. I'm so stressed. Life sure is a human race.
The new bowler has a cover point, long-on, square leg, extra cover and two short legs.
You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg.
He scores by dashing between the creases, provided the wicketkeeper hasn't whipped his bails off.
I was introducing myself to your wife, who I must say is a gorgeous bit of crumpet.
Excuse me, what I think you mean to say is, would I like a flower?
I know The Drunken Clam was your bar, but you and your friends can find somewhere else to act like idiots.
It's not just the rack or the caboose. It's that big sexy brain of yours.
They took our bar, then our friendship. What's next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films?
Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em back to whatever country they came from.
Splendid. An entire afternoon of her ers and ahs and 'alf a pound of ha'penny rice.
Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm supposed to say I am so up to it. Ha ha ha.
At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager?
Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass in World War II and we can do it again.
Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, we'll have to use our superior linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
I never saw it that way before... Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that?
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since high school. What are you doin' these days?
Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist? Police say no, but our producer says yes.
For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the phrase Hey, check out that flaming queen.
It appears the real arsonist is in custody, thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.
Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him, you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy...
I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash. I won't take no for an answer.
I mean, they're gonna be disappointed when they find out I'm not gay, but wow.
Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows.
No, no, no! If you're ever going to be a lady, you must speak like one.
We've got five days left, and I'll not lose my wager. Now repeat after me. Hello, Mother, have you hidden my hatchet?
Once again, here is how it should sound. How do you do? Here's how you sound.
I think she's got it. I think she's got it! The life of the wife is ended by the knife
And where's that bloody knife? In the wife, in the wife  The life of the wife is ended by the knife
There he is. We need to search the house for evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel.
There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand tour and show you my... private quarters?
One time I went up to this bloke's flat, rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.
Old sport, why don't you pull your face from your loins and bury it into some humble pie?
Here's to our wives. They may not be as hot as the women you see on TV.
I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson. Whatever he gets is too good for him.
Dear Stewie, I want you to know that I blame my father's death and my incarceration in this hellhole entirely on your awful mother.
If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.

Look, I'm that pretty dark-haired figure skater with the horse teeth, the one who got what she had coming.
First to where that Pakistani girl fell through the ice after coming to the States for her severely burned face she got when the man she refused to marry dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!
Then everything got hazy. Kevin went to live with a foster family for a while...
Which is good, cos I finally have someone to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.
Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.
Neil, I'm a flag girl now. I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
Are we all ready to cheer at the game tonight? We? Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
Yeah. This morning my mom was, like, Don't forget your lunch, and I'm all I'm a flag girl now, I won't forget my lunch, and she's all Don't forget your halftime routine.
I can't take out the garbage. I'm at the office and they're making me stay late.
Score's tied, next basket wins. You might finally beat your old man. Old man? I'm the white Larry Bird.
I care as much about the size of your penis as you care about the size of my breasts.
Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it in the manner to which you're accustomed.
In fact, a lot of women prefer them to normal-size bananas, because they're exotic and flavourful and very, very special.
I mean, mine goes inside me when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!
When you pull that thing into your garage, does the garage say Is it in yet?
You were right. I was nice to the cool kids and they didn't spit on me.
Yes. Now that they think you're their friend, it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.
Beautiful to look at, but mess with one of my chicks and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip your eyes out! Cookies are done.
You see, Peter, the way we look at it, a man's only as big as the gun he carries.
Careful. We don't want it to get too excited and go off in your hand.
Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete with my son or his freakishly large penis.
Let's hang a tyre on the end of it and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.
In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses used guns to conquer the Romans?
OK. Now we're gonna play Seven Minutes in Heaven, and it's my party, so I want Doug to go in the closet with... Meg.
I figured you might get soft on me, so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.
The only way to get rid of them is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
I was just being stupid. Take it from me, that thing you got there is a blessing.
I mean, every guy you see with a big house or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth is really just saying Don't look at my penis.

A family lost their lives when they swerved off the road and into a ravine, exploding on impact.
What the hell? Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart. Love, Peter.  Oh, how fun!
Before you tee off, here are your complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this mobile ball cleaner.
Loretta's mother is in town and we have to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.
You could be the first black guy to play this course. People are gonna be impressed.
Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois busy so I could be here. Grip it and rip it.
The fed will be lowering rates, so get your money out of T-bills and put it all into...
What Jughead has done here - and it's quite ingenious actually - is paint pupils on his eyelids so he can sleep through class without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
Oh, yeah. Thank God I get to hang out with a fascinating gent like yourself.
I can't until you have a revelation. One of those things that changes your life.
My Nose out in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some Crazy Lady and Middle-Aged Housewife, followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That and Silver Dasher.
Too late, Stewie. The fix is in and the noodles are boiling in the pot.
Where the hell have you been? When I said lunch, I said noon, not noonish.
Don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't zip up your fly, a seagull will get ya!
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you, Lois's dad was a pain in the ass when I met him.
Take the rap for this. I only get one chance to make a first impression.
And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at her. Huh? Show us front and back there, Lois.
Based on what you've seen with your wife, what can we expect in terms of droopage?
We were just about to sing a song about mopping. We're mopping the deck Which is Navy for floor And when we're done mopping We'll mop it some more
I was talking to a robe for 20 minutes before I realised you weren't in it.
Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.
All right. All right, that's it! I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.
But too late. Oh, and by the way, when the lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.
All we gotta do is get you fixed up. Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean shave, cologne... Chicks'll be all over you.
Now, I want you to go over there and ask those girls if you can play.
You have to counterbalance the weight at the point where the lever pivots. Like so.
That one's a feminist type, she's into he-men, and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this.
I met her last summer when her dad hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out.
Hi. I was just, uh... uh... in... in... I was just in the neighbourhood and...
Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack, so we had to pick her up some Kibbles 'n Bits.
See, this is why I hate clothes shopping. I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.
It's a long story - with terrific performances and a wonderful scene in a carnival.
No deal. Lois may be worth a million to you, but to me, she's worthless.
Holy crap! Back then I gave up a million bucks just to be with Lois.
Death, wait, wait, wait. Before we go, I need you to do me one more favour.
This is the most romantic gift you've ever given me. How did you put this together?
I bought these shoes from a company on the Internet, cos they don't test on animals.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
The tourists are gone and we have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over.
Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game, and red like the sauce on my mamma mia's gugotz.
Stop whining. Stay on your side. Lois, get off your ass and do some parenting.
Brothers and sisters fightin' is as natural as a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.
Wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.
Watch where you're going. Horace, put the Pats game on the TV and get me a few beers.
Public urination is just wrong. Except during the Million Man March when protesters burned our Porta-Pottis.
An idea so smart, my head would explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.
Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt cos girls don't have anything down there.
Come one, come all. She floats like a butterfly and stings like when I pee.
I want you to get rid of all of this right now, cos I am never fighting again, ever!
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
I know you're not puttin' that rock up from here. You ain't got no J.
Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers. Take some action.
Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.
Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy doll and show me how they act together.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
Technically, the first was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
I felt weak. You never listen to me. You undermine me in front of the kids.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.
I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb. Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales, but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.
Me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the rug by the door. I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg. For the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.  Dad! Dear Stewie. Get out.  That's nice.
Mine just says Dear Lois.  And after that it looks like someone just spit on the paper.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other.
How's this for a name? Pony Express is in.  What have you got for me, Joe? Let me see. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois.

If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
I know you're not puttin' that rock up from here. You ain't got no J.
Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine about the leafers. Take some action.
Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat, and I had sex with your mother last night.
Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy doll and show me how they act together.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
Technically, the first was that time bomb I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
I felt weak. You never listen to me. You undermine me in front of the kids.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.
I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb. Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales, but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.
Me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the rug by the door. I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg. For the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.  Dad! Dear Stewie. Get out.  That's nice.
Mine just says Dear Lois.  And after that it looks like someone just spit on the paper.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other.
How's this for a name? Pony Express is in.  What have you got for me, Joe? Let me see. It's here somewhere. Here we are. A big bag of liver spots for Lois.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of these two people in the bonds of holy matrimony, consecrated before God Almighty.
Let me guess. Another colourful box with a crank that I'm expected to turn until - big shock - a jack pops out.
And you laugh and the kids laugh and the dog laughs and I die a little inside.
When I stick this army guy with the sharp bayonet up my nose, it tickles my brain.
What I'm about to show you is a fight scene from Star Trek, season one, episode 18.
I'm going to identify when it's Shatner and when it's his stunt double, Fred Lubbins.
There's a law against teaching the evolutionary theory that Gil Gerard used a time machine and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.
Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are. ...turmoil when President Bush stuck his finger in a socket.
You'll gain valuable experience, work closely with Tom and me, and produce your own on-air report.
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you! This is beyond anything I've ever dreamed of!
Stay away from me, Neil. Just because we're working together does not mean I like you. Give it to me!
It's this incredibly benevolent force that wants me to know there's no reason to be afraid.
Hi, Mr Tucker. I brought you Rice Crispy Treats. I remember you said you liked them.
Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I suppose you do have to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues.
Mr Tucker, Miss Simmons, there's a nut on top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle.
Ha-ha! See ya later, sucker! And by the way, Rather is an OK guy in small doses.
All in a day's work. If you ever need me, just blow this whistle, or call John Stossel's cellphone.
We now go to junior anchor Neil Goldman with exclusive footage from today's exciting scene.
Thank you, Diane. There may have been some commotion on the rooftop, but the real story was inside the mouths of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman, where a meeting of the tongues, a summit of saliva, established a new world order of love.
This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil and begin life anew as Meil.
I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.
I'm here to turn myself in. I have a dismembered hooker bleeding in my trunk.
The normal plan is 78 months at 40 a month and 200 down. Watch this.
Seeing as you two will one day bless our home with the pitter-patter of grandchildren as ugly as sin.
I remember when Muriel and I had our first kiss, and it was just awful.
Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible mucus coming out from inside my nose.
They called me Tasty Cakes, and they would beat me and stick pine cones in my ass.
Once for the bulk, and again for the remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.
My hooligan friend, I've been racking my brain in a fruitless attempt to resolve our unpleasantness.
But then it dawned on me. Your cruelty merely stems from a deep-seated inner pain.
We go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel Five junior anchor segment on the moon.
I mean, who in their right mind would? I went to the streets to find out.
A breaking story! A geek is on top of Town Hall! He's about to jump!
I was just a piece of eye candy that she turned into an all-day sucker.
Just because you're repulsive and the most annoying person on the planet, and I'm not the only one who thinks so, doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.

I gave him some special ointment, and he hurt so bad that he had to apply it in the car with his sock.
I bet you're just a low-level assembly-line guy who stands all day screwing heads on dolls. Ooh, is it on straight? I don't know.  Boo!
Finally, we go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, interviewing a guy from the Renaissance Fair.
Thanks, Tom. Sir, for those who aren't familiar with the tradition, tell us about the Renaissance Fair.
Yea. But first, bride of Genghis, thou must explainest to me thy very peculiar electronic wand.
Ahem. Cinderella had three wicked step-watermelons who were very smelly to her. So her fairy god-toilet turned a pumpkin into a fanny and sent her off to the poop.
I was terrible. Everyone else had an important job and was way more successful than me.
Mr Weed, I, uh... was wondering if maybe you'd like to come to my house for dinner Friday night.
If I blow this, I'll have to go back to my old job at The Electric Company.
Oh, God. I hope I don't get so nervous I can't control the volume of my voice.
Mmmm. Who would think that a woman with such beauty would have the culinary skills of Emeril Lagasse?
Mr Weed, I don't care what the guys at work say. I don't think you're an effeminate weirdo.
Peter, being here with your wonderful family, your beautiful home and your funny talking dog... well, I'm impressed.
In other news, toy industrialist Jonathan Weed was found dead in the home of an employee who claims Weed choked on a roll.
And now, the last man to see Jonathan Weed alive has offered to say a few words.
As you know, we of the Christian faith believe that Jesus is not really dead, but that he must let the world think he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.
I'm Mr Weed's lawyer. We found this tape among Mr Weed's personal effects with instructions that it be screened immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.
Hello, friends. If you are watching this, I am dead, and I bet you're pretty bummed.
The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory shall be torn down to make way for the Happy-Go-Lucky Terminal Disease Institute.
OK, we've got your typing test here and all the pertinent data about your, um... um, you know, your background and, um... skills and...
I only have another week and a half here, and I have completely checked out.
Yes, you go to Maple Street, and then take a left, and then you go...
He was so forgetful, whenever he tried to remember a name, he drew a... blank.
This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you so hard to invite Mr Weed to dinner, he'd still be alive and you'd have your job.
I've saved some money from teaching piano, and this is the perfect time for you to pursue that dream.
If you were cool with it, we could go from there. But this is a much better idea!
Yes. I'm trying to overcome my fear of swords because a man in a pirate suit stabbed me in the ear when I was five, and then again when I was 30. And you? The same?
I was going through that rebellious phase, and I was hanging out with a bad crowd.
I was saved by the one and only Black Knight of the Quahog Renaissance Fair.
A word of advice. The path to knighthood is paved with strength and nobility, not LSD and sideburns.
And from that moment on, I knew someday I wanted to be a knight like him.
Look alive. Allow me to introduce the best of the best, the Black Knight himself!
I just wanted to thank you. I don't know if you remember, but when I was a kid, you helped me get my life back on track.
Hey, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker, and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm protected by my impenetrable cereal-box fort. Ha-ha-ha!
If I'm gonna impress the Black Knight, my lance must be with me at all times.
She walks over here and asks me to put a bird in her panties! I'm going What the hell?
But I'm being serious here. We were all set to come see you joust today.
I'll be watching him from the stands, because the Black Knight is a big jerk, just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.
Let's go to the field, where the Black Knight prepares to challenge his opponent. Ohh... Hey Ohh... Hey
And what are you doing here, Griffin? I told you never to come here again!
Except that guy who called me a fizzle and then ran off. He got away with it.
After today, only half the people who called me a fizzle will have gotten away with it.
Lt'll be OK, Chris. Remember that episode of The Honeymooners when Ralph lost his job but didn't get it back?
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Peter, this is ridiculous. I know you're upset about losing your job, but you've sat there for two weeks.
Would those who are going away for spring break please move to the left of the room?
So do we. I'll tell you what. How about you and I have our own little spring break?
I guess it couldn't be worse than last year when we all went to Sea World.
And now the actual boat itself. Do I have an opening bid for the boat?
Don't expect me to fish your dead body from an angry sea that gave you fair warning.
Hey, this is VH1 and we're rocking at spring break. ...leaving thousands injured. For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw, keeping it real and kicking ass at spring break! Whoo!
Here she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful than Superman, Batman, Spiderman and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.
I'll let you in on a secret, neighbour. The best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71.
Cos I don't like you! We don't need any more fishermen crowding up this wharf!
I jerk 'em around. They fight for a while. Then they lay back and accept it.
Did I ever tell you if you're on birth control and you take an antibiotic, it makes it not work?
I wanna go home and spend the next three days in solitary confinement where I belong!
Your house? This is my house. My wife and I bought it from the bank.
While I may not agree with what you say, I'll defend to the death your right to say it.
You were gonna pop inside real quick and find someone who looked like me so I could use their ID, then you were supposed to come out and give me the ID so I can get inside!
Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates. Oh, God, wait. How did that one go?
A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks like a jackal! Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?
What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks need love, too. But they got to pay.
Sure, I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye was infected that day from picking at it, and I was tired, and I'd been swimming in a pool with too much chlorine, and my glasses were at LensCrafters, but I seen that fish!
I gotta be crazy to think I can kill that man-eating fish. What the hell am I doing?
These are the best years of your life. Let's get up there and live a little.
Too bad I didn't get there till after the sodomy. Let's go kick some fish ass!
If you're gonna grab ahold of life, you've gotta expect to get your hands dirty once in a while.
Amen to that. You guys, here's one for you. Let's say none of us were married.
I heard that one of Shannon Doherty's eyes is off-centre cos it's trying to escape.
My God. Isn't it amazing that that's what we all look like on the inside?
The longer we stay here, the more people will question how a fisherman with no engineering background built a sophisticated talking fish robot.
Getting drunk and ditching you at the bar, and letting those boys take pictures of you sleeping.
I was so busy having fun, I guess I kind of ruined it for you.
I got to admit I half expected to come home, and our stuff would be gone, and we'd owe somebody a lot of money.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I promised her I'd be on the next train. Poor Carol, all alone in that big house.
In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby to smother with all your unrequited love.
And as soon as the baby can crawl, it'll probably leave me too, just like my eight husbands.
You gotta relax. You let that kid start calling the shots now and you're screwed.
This is a song I've been singing for a number of years, and I find it grows truer and truer as time goes by.
All right, I'm just going to put on a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.
Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why the deuce would they want to replace me?
It can't happen. I was here first. Well, technically third, but no time for semantics.
As God is my witness, from this day forward, Peter and Lois shall not conceive.
We were keeping it a secret, but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.
Fat man, we'll see if Lois wants to have sexual relations when she finds lipstick on your collar.
You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad and you don't care who you get it from, because you have no self-respect, and that gets you off, doesn't it?
Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time spent keeping people from having sex!
Very well, then. If I can't stop them from the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.
As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate of every sperm in Peter's body.
Very well. Through the lips, over the gums. Look out, testicles, here I come! Lois You can't spell love without L-O You can't spell is without I-S You can't spell silo without Lois
If I'm to reach the testicles and destroy the sperm before coitus, I must buy some time.
Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be able to do away with that red-headed woman.
When you're born, don't let the doctor slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I wanna get Barbara a really nice gift. What kind of gifts have boys gotten for you, Meg?
I read a book saying women are from Venus, so here's what you get her.
Layers of sulphuric acid, viscous surface rock, and coronae, which seem to be domes over large magma chambers. Here's five dollars.
That's OK, Dad. I was thinking about getting a paper route so I could buy her gift myself.
It'll make you smell like Elizabeth Taylor. So I guess you'll smell of bourbon and Vicodin.
It's this girl. I can't talk to her. It's like girls are a different species or somethin'.
Then you need to come on down to the cellar. I got a whole freezer full of Popsicles. Mm.
All right, then give me one of them horoscope scrolls and some Skittles. Financial transaction benefits you today.  Oooh!
Your parents are on their way, but since time is a factor here we'd like to get an ID quickly.
He's here to finger the guy who held up that store. Maybe you've seen him. Chris Griffin.
Hang on to that, I got a ton of 'em at home. I was gonna throw that one out anyway.
Chris messed it up by writing his school schedule and a list of his fears on the back.
We're so proud of you, Chris, for helping to put that horrible man in jail.
This man will stop at nothing. We're placing you all in the Witness Protection Program.
Is Europe an option? I've always wanted to spend a year in Prague teaching English.
Where the black guys are really lazy, and the white guys are just as lazy but they're mad at the black guys for being lazy?
I can't believe I have to change schools because of you. This is all your fault, Lardo.
I bet if we fixed it up a little bit, it could be a piece of crap.
You know you're a redneck when your gun rack has a gun rack on it.
Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement and it has a hand in it.
I bet if we explore the town we'll each find something about it we like.
Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the mud harvest. Nice making your acquaintance.
That was great! Next time, let's get Meg to be Boss Hogg and Chris can be Anus.
All right, that's enough questions for Megan. Time to hand back last week's spelling tests.
I'm glad you're having fun, but we need money. Have you thought about a job?
Is that something you wanna put our family through? Think about that while I get a drink.
If you're bad, you go to a place where the dead believe they're still livin' and they pray for death, but death won't come.
I don't know. Maybe Lois is right. Maybe it is time for me to get a job.
Y'all interested? We take turns being sheriff. You just hang out here, eat pie and get drunk.
I kn... I know. There's nothin'... nothin' to, um... to, uh... um... uh... Oh, boy, what's the word I'm looking for? Do.
Robert E Lee. I knew I'd find you here, where they seat the sorry-ass losers.
Ulysses S Grant, you invite me to lunch then show up an hour late, drunk?
And if you think I'm mad now, you gotta answer to them Civil War survivors.
Man, was last night weird. I kissed a boy! But I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam.
But I don't know if I can face him again. Brian, what should I do?
Um, listen, Sam. I like hangin' out with you and all, it's just that I don't want a romantic relationship.
Come to earth When I went to meet her, man, you should have seen her
Loves to eat A big old Buddha belly and her breasts swing past her feet My fat baby loves to eat My big ole fat-ass baby loves to eat
Listen, promise you won't be mad, and it's probably nothing, but you know that criminal who's after your son? He might know where you guys are.
What?! Peter, that criminal is on his way here to kill Chris. We gotta call the sheriff.
Sheriff's office. Yes, this is Peter Griffin. I'd like to report a criminal coming into town.
Yeah, well, see, I kinda pissed off the whole town at that Civil War re-enactment.
Oh, and to the owner of a John Deere tractor, you're parked on top of a pig.
Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking to girls. That's why I ran away from you.
I hated TJ Hooker. And I never actually saw McMillan and Wife, although I was aware of it.
And after I said all Southerners have bad teeth and the gum disease known as gingivitis.
We take care of our own. And as long as y'all live here, y'all are Southerners too.
I think the lesson here is it doesn't matter where you're from, as long as we're all the same religion.
We didn't have no money for a present, so we all just spit in a jar.
Next time I see a dead guy, I'm gonna poke him twice as hard for both of us.
Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple of days. Wonderin' if you're ever gonna come back.
Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.
I am going to kick your ass. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Gorgeous. We sit here and force small talk while they have the time of their lives.
Wow. Does it really smell like cook...? God! She farted and it went down my throat!
That's a great idea. I'll learn how to act like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now.
The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this. I'd be more apathetic if I weren't so lethargic.
Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny. Yeah, can I have a copy of Jugs?
Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man.
I know. It's just, I should be able to control my baser instincts, but lately I've just been having these urges.
Why don't you come to my parents' house? The fresh air will help you relax.
I said, I know the guy that... Oh, I'll tell you later. I love this song.
Thanks, but I think a quiet weekend by myself is just the thing I need.
He said he'd give me a hundred dollars if I took off all my clothes off.
He walks up to the premier of China and says Dong, where is my automobile?
OK. You know, maybe later I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place and introduce her to that mulatto boy who looks a lot like...
I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.
I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What have you got?
You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's a million a year?
I noticed it when he did an interview and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.
Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am about this. I don't know what came over me.
Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?
I just want you to know I am going to do the right thing here.
I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting it on with your dog.
Peter, do you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?
I'll cut you up so bad you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.
I should go. Take this. It's probably not a good idea for us to meet any more.
This is Tricia Takanawa live where police have discovered the whereabouts of Sea Breeze, the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
Hello, this is Tom Tucker's evil twin Todd Tucker out to destroy his brother's reputation.
I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.
My face is on the news. Your father won't let me see the dog carrying my puppies.
He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him that's getting to me, it's your father.
I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.
I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to take care of the puppies.
They're not his to take care of. They're my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.
I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for this!
I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the store for taping over movies.
Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you stare at it long enough, you see something?
Now, isn't it true that you told my client that Brian is a menace to society and should never be allowed to see his children?
If I was half the parent he is, I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...
If he was to repeat his actions, he would be setting a bad example for his puppies.
You're almost there, Sea Breeze. Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them.
This is like a Greek tragedy where a man chooses between himself and his children.
Sure you want to go through with this? You could have puppies with another dog.
I am not looking forward to what you're gonna be like once they do this to you.
Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.

I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.
I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN with US Steel. What have you got?
You sold me out. I could use a man like you. How's a million a year?
I noticed it when he did an interview and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.
Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am about this. I don't know what came over me.
Get away from me! You and that filthy mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?
I just want you to know I am going to do the right thing here.
I am gonna go back in time and stop Brian from getting it on with your dog.
Peter, do you know what I'm going to do to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?
I'll cut you up so bad you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.
I should go. Take this. It's probably not a good idea for us to meet any more.
This is Tricia Takanawa live where police have discovered the whereabouts of Sea Breeze, the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
Hello, this is Tom Tucker's evil twin Todd Tucker out to destroy his brother's reputation.
I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.
My face is on the news. Your father won't let me see the dog carrying my puppies.
He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him that's getting to me, it's your father.
I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.
I don't know how my mother puts up with it. He did promise to take care of the puppies.
They're not his to take care of. They're my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.
I had no idea you could be so cruel. I'll never forgive you for this!
I rented those for Peter. He got banned from the store for taping over movies.
Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you stare at it long enough, you see something?
Now, isn't it true that you told my client that Brian is a menace to society and should never be allowed to see his children?
If I was half the parent he is, I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...
If he was to repeat his actions, he would be setting a bad example for his puppies.
You're almost there, Sea Breeze. Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before, but promise me you won't eat any of them.
This is like a Greek tragedy where a man chooses between himself and his children.
Sure you want to go through with this? You could have puppies with another dog.
I am not looking forward to what you're gonna be like once they do this to you.
I don't wanna go on a rant here, but America's foreign policy makes about as much sense as Beowulf havin' sex with Robert Fulton at the first battle of Antietam.
What the hell does rant mean? It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I was lookin' to break off somethin', but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank and she's all about the bling-bling.
Meg, start at Psalm 41. Don't stop readin' till I tell you. The power of Christ compels you!
I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with her cooking, but somehow I think she knew.
Lois had always been full of energy and life, but lately I had grown aware of her ageing.
The bright, exuberant eyes I had fallen in love with were growing dull and listless with the long fatigue of a weary life.
I awoke several hours later in a daze. I was brought up on the streets, no moms and dads I had to fend for myself with my own two hands But today I'm hurtin', and I'll tell you why I got a hangnail hangin' from my cuticle A hangnail It ain't beautiful It hurts like a bitch that I did last night
Just layin' back in the cot, peepin' at this here homey. Yo, Pops, gimme some cheddar.
Chris starts with all this Yo, yo, yo stuff, and I don't know what he's talkin' about.
So I started beatin' him with a hose. Then my arm got tired, so I came here.
Perhaps Chris has adopted another culture's mannerisms because he doesn't know enough about his own.
Gentlemen, today we, Ireland's top scientists, have found a way to convert our entire population to pure energy.
It's just a place where homeless people come to shave and go BM. Let's go inside.
I gotta say, the man in this book does look an awful lot like you.
The Diary of Nate Griffin. May 7th, 1836. I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt, when she let out a fart right near my face. So I took her head and stuck it by my butt and blew a huge fart right back at her.
Oh, my God. This is date three. Are you gonna let him get to second base?
I think that would be a bad idea. And I know something about bad ideas.
The family has become poor white trash since then, so they only gave what they could.
I share them with all of you in the hopes that one day your wounds may be healed as well.
Yep. I even got my own posse. Big Dog, T-Bone, Shades, go make some sandwiches.
Nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took care of in exchange for doing a few chores.
You can whip me all you like, white devil, but you'll never break my spirit!
Your Body and You. Every four weeks, it's entirely normal for every young woman to...
Oh, my God! Oh! That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life!
It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's my slave name. Call me Kichwa Tembo.
I will not give you an apology, and I assume Rice Krispie treats is black slang for money, so here's $10,000.
This just in: Slave-owner descendant Carter Pewterschmidt has paid $20,000, or two million pennies, in reparations to a local black man.
Hey, from down there, does it look like I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?
Oh, my God! You turned the den into Pee-wee's Playhouse? Come on, get up Knock off your nappin' It's a crazy, messed-up place where anything can happen There's a chair that freakin' talks There's some fish that give advice Holy crap! It's screwy in Peter's Playhouse
The king of cartoons will be here in five minutes, and I won't have you embarrass me.
So it's agreed: We'll keep on pretending to like pigs' feet just to confound the white man.
Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't spell your name with that insufferable i.
Nate Griffin. Oh, my God, you're haunting me because I've been a terrible black man.
You see, Peter, the most important thing is how a man acts. You see what I'm gettin' at?
Don't worry about me. If it makes you feel better, I peed in their cereal every morning.
That's enough of that. There's a hunting knife under your seats. On my command... Argh!
Argh! You idiots! I had them! Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.
It just goes to show you, Lois, it doesn't matter if you're black or white.

Those were the people who were mean to me in junior high. Tomorrow, high school.
I'm here on Spooner Street where several Quahog families are holding a car wash to raise money for an organ transplant for young Paul Lewis.
With me is one of Paul's classmates, Chris Griffin, who helped organise this charity event. You're a very thoughtful young man, Chris.
So you want the full wash... Oh, you've got a nick there. I can probably get that out for you.
If you want to go with a scent, I've got PB and J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy.
Here's to Joe, who helped little Paul get a new liver and, barring a massive infection, a new lease on life.
We can't keep it in my room cos there's an evil monkey that lives in my closet.
Come on, Joe. Cheer up. What do you say you and me go roller-ska... bike-ri... jump ro... go lay on the grass?
If you and/or a friend are disabled and would like to challenge yourself, sign up today.
Hey, I believed you could be a desk. Come on! I'll even be your coach.
I was in Richard Simmons' Sweatin' to Books on Tape. The Red Sox were in town, but I didn't care, because it was Tuesday and I was on my way to see Maury. He couldn't go to the bathroom by himself any more, but his indomitable spirit...
It sure is. Today we'll see some of our finest athletes struggle valiantly against God's twisted designs. You'll cheer, you'll cry. You might get a cheap laugh.
I know I will, Tom. In fact, by the end of the day, we may all be going to hell.
Listen, Joe. You and I both know you have what it takes to win this thing.
Now the first decathlon event, the pole vault, where Joe Swanson takes his starting position.
We'll go to bulimic pie-eating in a moment, but first, decathlon frontrunner Joe Swanson will attempt the long jump.
For Swanson to take the gold, he'll have to win the final event, the 100-metre dash.
Tell your wife to come over to my place if she wants a little boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.
Did he quit after losing millions of his father's friends' money in failed oil companies? No.
Did he quit after gettin' arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct at a football game? No.
I don't understand why he did that without me. We were gonna do everything together.
Once a man at his physical peak, brought down by a cruel twist of fate.
Friday on ABC, followed by Dharma and Greg, but you don't have to watch that.
Joe wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for me. How come he's gettin' all the glory?
All right, I know how to settle this. Whoever wants the money, raise your hand.
I even got the first piece you're gonna run. Exclusive footage of my tragic accident.
Mr Griffin, you can't expect me to believe this. That was clearly a scarecrow in your clothes.
Today we're here to honour Joe Swanson for pulling my one-eyed cat Bootsie out of the old stovepipe of my grandmother's cabin.
Don't forget our deal, Lois. I sit through this and later tonight I get anal.
Peter, go talk to him. After all, you set out to make him feel better.
I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special is justice, served cold with a side of jail.

So, you want to dress me up and trot me about like a circus poodle, hm?
Every year, I look up at that star and I think of all of the joy and wonder that Christmas promises and that miracle that occurred on that silent winter's night.
Hey, I'm on vacation! Happy birthday, Jesus! Seven maids a-milking, six maids a-milking, five maids a-milk...
If you get us a tree, I'll make sure Santa brings you a new VCR. Please?
Honey, Santa got all his shopping done before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.
That's better than being selfish like Meg, right? So I should get more than her.
Except for the one with no legs! Look at the parents telling their kids not to stare. How does his pee-pee work, Mommy? I've got news for you, Becky. Not so well!
But you owe me. Later, under the mistletoe. Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am.
The gifts are in the trunk. Don't forget to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers.
Yeah, Peter, one of us has to be the designated driver, and I've already had four eggnogs, so I guess you're it.
I'm a cop first, a buddy second, so don't think I wouldn't throw your drunk-driving ass in the slammer!
No, thanks. The last one you gave me didn't taste like lemon. It tasted like...
Now you go relax while I make my little Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.
They sent you a card, but it said for Peter, so you must've thought it was from you, so you didn't, uh...
There's a laser grid three inches above the floor, so you have to compress your body to the size of a sponge and slide underneath like some kind of weird amphibious dolphin.
If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
I am a bit irritated that I have to shop again. But at least some good came out of it.
You can watch all the TV you want... just as soon as we get back from the mall.
We'll shop, come home, eat, and then it's off to the pageant to see little Stewie play Baby Jesus.
It's good to see you. I would've been here sooner, but Lincoln gave me the wrong Gettysburg Address.
How about this having to sit still for 60 seconds to have your picture taken?
Can any of us be good? Are our primal urges innate or the result of our choices?
All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium, then your wager is accepted. I will be nice.
Lois, it was horrible. The fish were jumping all over my eyes and in my nose, and one of them muttered something anti-Semitic.
OK, so a couple of things have gone wrong. But we can still have a great Christmas.
So cook your own damn turkey, wrap your own damn presents, and while you're at it, you can all ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell!
You all expect someone else to do it for you, like Santy Claus or Mommy!
If this is the way she's gonna act at Christmas, do we even want her back?
Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty of me not to fulfil my obligation to Mother.
Thank God years ago I planted a homing device in her skull for just such an occasion.
Hang on. Lois is only up there because we sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her.
As we all know, Christmas is that mystical time of year when the ghost of Jesus rises from the grave to feed on the flesh of the living.
Good evening. I'm playing the role of Jesus, a man once portrayed on the big screen by Jeffrey Hunter.
Mr Hunter was good enough to die for our sins, but not quite up to the task of seducing green women.
And so we unselfishly think of others, assured that our good behaviour will be rewarded with love... and plutonium.
It's OK. Your mom's just full of Christmas cheer and enough tranquilliser to bring down a bull elephant.
You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR, and best of all, my own copy of Kiss Saves Santa.

Me, too. I just saw Don Giovanni. In my opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.
Don't slow down, Jonas. Keep the rhythm. Bum, bum, bum, bum Brian, your standards are ridiculously high You'll never find a girl unless you compromise so you can find your love I don't think I have to compromise a thing I'd rather be alone if someone doesn't get me How long has the coffee been on the burner? I could really use a cup about now Oh, it's not very fresh I meant to make more I made the mistake of watching Oprah She had on James Garner
Oh, yeah, Steve. He's... new to the mountain. I met him down at the general store.
Why do you think Jesus Christ was so popular? Because of all the magic tricks?
Binary code is a computer language in which words are translated into zeroes and ones.
Anything can be expressed in binary, as we demonstrate in this scene from The Miracle Worker.
You don't think this is amazing? When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair,
It's OK. You'll get through this DUl and you'll be a better person for it.
You're not one to talk. Remember when I gave you apple juice and told you it was wine?
Are you gonna listen to me so I can tell you that I respect you?
And if I have any advice to give you, it is this: Grow a beard.
I gotta take care of an old woman who hasn't been out in 30 years.
I've seen it sitting in there, lazy, slothful porcelain layabout feeding on other people's doo-doos while contributing nothing to society!
I'm Dr Goodman of the Quahog Ornithological Society, ironically dining in a restaurant that serves poultry.
I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.
You have to wait until the bird departs of its own accord or you'll be prosecuted.
You're one phone call away from getting a human booster shot from a guy named Mali.
That's it. You're history, pal. No bird Frenches my wife and gets away with it.
You're a miserable, dried-up shut-in, trying to make everyone feel as bad as you do!
Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't turn on a radio or television without hearing one of her trademark jingles. You're only healthy when you're tan So soak up all the sun you can With Copper... Coppertone
At her peak, Pearl Burton earned 26 grand a year, which, by today's standards, would be just under 49 billion dollars.
In 1961, Pearl used an appearance at Carnegie Hall to make the leap from jingle-singer to artist.
What do you want for dinner? I was thinking of making that lamb and rice you love.
Brian, you know I can't do that. I haven't left this house in such a long time.
In fact, allow me to fill you in. The '60s brought the hippie breed And decades later things have changed indeed We lost the values but we kept the weed You've got a lot to see The Reagan years have laid the frame For movie stars to play the White House game We're not too far from voting Feldman-Haim You've got a lot to see The town of Vegas has got a different face Cos it's a family place with lots to do Where in the '50s, a man could mingle with scores of all the seediest whores Now his children can, too You heard it from the canine's mouth The country's changed - that is, except the South And you'll agree No one really knows, my dear lady friend Just quite how it all will end So hurry cos you've got a lot to see The baldness gene was cause for dread But that's a fear that you can put to bed They'll shave your ass and glue it on your head You've got a lot to see The PC age has moved the bar A word like redneck is a step too far The proper term is country music star You've got a lot to see Our flashy cellphones make people mumble Gee whiz Look how important he is, his life must rule. You'll get a tumour, but on your surgery day The doc will see it and say Wow, you must really be cool
Neil Armstrong on the moon Neil Armstrong? Wait, was he the trumpet guy? So let's go see the USA They'll treat you right unless you're black or gay or Cherokee But you can forgive the world and its flaws And follow me there because You've still got a hell of a lot to see You've got a lot to see

Oh, yeah? Well, put up or shut up. This Thursday, auditions for the Quahog School of Performing Arts.
Mark! Wow, what a journey! Thank you. Those three and a half hours just flew by.
Hey, Santos, Pascoal. You've done such good work today, I got a surprise for you.
Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it. ...Dr Philips today. I might not make it to Christmas.
Well, you little jaybird! You wanna tell your mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?
Oh, my God! She's got hair growin' out of her boobs and up to her head.
Don't get too cocky. I had a big one like that when I was your age.
At first I wanted you to fail. But then I realised you'd be out five days a week, which means I'd be free to throw some of my sexy parties.
You're gonna do an exercise we call The Life Cycle. Without using words, you're gonna act out your entire life from birth to death as I describe it.
Your son is holding your hand. You tell him you accept his lifestyle and regret humiliating him at his sister's wedding by calling him your other daughter.
You've taken that and used it out of context to insult me in this everyday situation.
What a clever, smart girl you must be to come up with a joke like that all by yourself.
Any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me while we're hitting these phenomena at the height of their popularity?
Stewie Griffin is also on the fence. If he and Olivia don't deliver at their reviews,
I'll spare you the details, but the phrase garden variety appears a number of times.
Our evaluation's tomorrow. You need someone to work with, and I need someone to make me look good.
Linda Evans, we have a spill in aisle 9. Linda Evans, a spill in aisle 9.
You do Who's got a girl he'd like to one day undress? Give it a rest - I told you not until we're married
Sure, Lois. Look at Elroy Jetson. He was a child actor and he turned out fine.
Completely. We totally reamed her. Did you see that look in her eyes? She hates you.
It took a lot of guts for them to do that. I'll see you later.
Simon, would you be a dear and ask Stewie to dance on his own feet tonight?
The Providence Journal's critic is here. If we get a good review, the doors'll fly open.
I don't need this act and I don't need you. You've done nothing but hold me back. I quit!
I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia, this act is like Fire Island after Labor Day: Over.
Yes. Yes, I'm quite capable of that. I've got my top hat and cane And a pocketful of miracles, pocketful of miracles
Hi, Bernie. Glad to be back. Ask Stewie about his sexy parties. Ask Stewie about his sexy parties.  What were you thinking?
I was having a problem understanding why I'd been taking abuse from this lower-ranking officer played by Chris O'Donnell.
I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing. I heard some things...
If you're not busy... what say you and I get the old team back together?

You don't have to keep moving to the back. You can have as many as you want.
They got a great deal on pianos if you buy a four-pack. Meg, help me get these down.
Ross Fishman, is that really you? I haven't seen you since college. How are you?
So am I. Does that mean we're not allowed to stay in touch with old friends?
And I'm ashamed of myself that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me from rekindling an old friendship just because it was with a man.
Thank you. Thank you very much. This next one is for all the ladies out there.
Lois, can you grab me a beer? Oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!
It's got a cloaking device that disguises it as two homeless guys fighting over a wedge of cheese.
Oh, your wife and children are beautiful. It's so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.
Our armies are ready. We will leave the sewers and strike back at the humans in the overworld.
And look! Look! I left the toilet just as it was the night we went to the prom.
You were going 65, fella. That's ten miles over the... Why are you holding his hand?
What a surprise that you would look me up! You always thought I was so handsome.
How far can you get this banana... I can't say it. She's looking right at me.
I'd like to put video cameras in every room of your house so I can observe your uncensored behaviour.
This hurts me more than it hurts you. Ow! Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. Today he was out in the yard raking leaves. God, I wish he'd throw me into that pile of leaves.
I recommend a trial separation, during which time I advise that you date other people.
I realise this is upsetting. That's why I've invited Howie Mandel to lighten the mood by blowing up a surgical glove with his nose.
I know. But maybe the doctor's right. This time apart could be good for us.
I'd sit here and chat, but I need to get back upstairs to Loretta because it's our anniversary and the getting's good.
We like to watch old movies while listening to Hotel California to see if it syncs up in a significant way.
So, Mr Griffin, how does it feel to be a bachelor on the prowl again?
It's not as great as you'd think. I don't have the same way with women that I used to.
My name is Mort and I live with my mother. And I have very low standards.
Muriel and I feel that you need to follow your therapist's advice and start dating.
Hi. Peter Griffin. We can go anywhere except the disco. They don't let me in any more.
It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again. Ha!
I just noticed. How often do you see a 17th-century well in this day and age?
Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap before they put you in anything decent.
The food here is fantastic. This is where I took Lois on our first date.
I'll go to the john and fire one out in five minutes. That should make room for dinner.
Wow! I wonder who she's here with. She could date any man she wanted to.
That's it! You have got to be the most vile, disgusting human being I've ever met!
I won't stand by and watch my husband lock lips with another woman! Beat it!

The pair with the rip in the right butt cheek from stepping on 'em in the airplane bathroom when you had the trots?
No, with the hole in the left butt cheek from holding it in for two hours cos it was a long church sermon and I thought blowing gas would offend Jesus, so I let it go in the vestibule and it sounded like Louis Armstrong.

I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. The receipt's on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit, but I'm sure if you make a fuss, they'll give you a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's just I can't imagine when I would ever wear it. You know? I also left a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to, but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do, I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'II... Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did it have buttons? Hm. I should wrap this up before I start to ramble. OK, goodbye for ever.
Great. I'm stuck on a transatlantic flight with a petulant runaway. Could it get worse?
First of all, you can't get 'em open. Who are they trying to keep out of these?
And what's with the razor-blade slot in the bathroom? Do people really shave in there?
Hi. Andy Dick here. Excuse me. I've got to get my bag up in the overhead bin here. Oh!
I've got Dude, My Car Is Not Where I Parked It, But Praise Allah, We Are Not Hurt.
Camels for sale! This one owned by a little old man who only drove it to mosque on Sundays. Just had its knees replaced.
We'll have to distract him. Follow my lead. You and I are so awfully different Too awfully different to ever be pals
Bite me, Snoopy. There's not a whole lot that we've got to agree on Cos I love the strains of a classical score And I like that singer who looks like a whore
Doo doo doo doo doo doo dooie doo Your head's as massive as a meteorite
Oh, very funny. You have a weenie like a Christmas-tree light I'd bet money you'll marry a honey Who's pretty and funny, and her name'll be Ted
I work with what you give me. You might think we're in sync, but we stink as a duo Cos you get a kick out of carnage and guts And you get a kick out of stroking your...
Chucky had the biggest hump of all the local camels, and was picked on for it.
Then there was a drought, and Chucky went to the oasis at great risk cos he was like that.
He drank and stored enough water in his massive hump to slake the thirst of...
I know it's gross, but when you're staring death in the face, you have no choice but to...
Recite the ad that brought Peter to Paul and Gene's attention. Drummer willing to do anything to make it.  Rolling Stone, October, 1972.
No more balloon for you! I am sick of you tooling around the village in it, honking at the girls, blasting your 1980s American rock music that we got last week.
I have no intention of returning to that disgusting hovel with that intolerable woman, that fat slob and that insufferable dog.
Oh, you're right here, aren't you? I stand by it. My future is with Jolly Farm!
You make the pope look like a fool! God will make you pay. Smite them!
I had to call a professor to tell me what phrase to use to describe it.
I wanted to share in all aspects of your life, but I just was never that big a KISS fan.
Not true. Ground meat can go very wrong for me very quickly, and everyone will suffer the consequences!
Lois, I am obligated to keep loving you so I will take my rage out on my own body.
Guys, this is the girl I told you about. I knew her before we formed KISS. Loose Lois!
Oh, wow! Such a small world. He was a nice boy, and he's still nice.
It's cardboard! There are no words, there are just... What is it you've drawn here?
Hey, come on. You wanna get some ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right?
We're back with KISS Forum. I'm with the Griffins, and they got something to share.
The best advice I can give is, you never know who's gonna grow up to be famous, so make yourself available.
Enjoy. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
Carol, how did Nick answer the following: The last thing I would ever give my wife is... blank?
That's easy. I wish I could see what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.
Come on, that's classic travelling music. Try to enjoy it. Riding on a bus, riding on a bus, sitting next to bums There's an open seat, hope that isn't pee
I know you might be a little concerned about me not having bones, but I gotta tell you, it's not that bad.
I invited some friends over to jump on him like a trampoline, but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe and his mom yelled at him when he got home and he beat me up at school the next day! It's all here in this pamphlet.
We have to learn to accept this, like one of those stories on Dateline where a family member suffers a horrible accident and is a burden on everybody.
I might've screwed up my life but there's no reason to keep screwing up theirs.
As you can tell from my husband, I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.
I'm a doctor doing an experimental procedure to give bones to ajellyfish, but I'd like to try it on a human. Interested?
Like I always say, a family of freaks is better than no family at all!
Those big fangs. Have they ever shown him do somebody in, then feed on him?
You're asking if they've done a Sesame Street in which the Count kills somebody, then sucks their blood for sustenance?
Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll. ...my superstrength, or Meg's, um... super-amazing ability to grow her fingernails, we must to use these powers properly and not abuse them for personal gain.
Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me, would you watch him for a moment?
What does that cloud look like to you, honey? To me it looks like... rain.
Oh, my God, *NSync is in town. If you get me a lock of Justin's hair,
I was in the neighbourhood - I'm gonna steal one of your beers - and I figured I'd stop by and say hi.
This is just one of many public disturbances caused by the Griffin family of Quahog, who seem to have acquired superpowers.
It will depict Blair Warner admitting to Mrs Garrett that the poem she submitted for her creative writing class was plagiarised from a work by Emily Dickinson.
No, no! That's not what Mrs Garrett's bosom looked like. It looked more like this.
Now, now. The doctor says I'll make a full recovery. But you learned your lesson.
Thank you. As long as I have Mrs Garrett's giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right.
Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club.
I sure wish I could meet a brave fella like the guy in this book.
Not to mention the myriad of bacteria and allergens from years of substandard housekeeping. It does not augur well for you.
Aw, zip it, egghead. You with your big words and your... and your small difficult words.
Wow! Any boy who would spend the night in that creepy place sure would be the bravest fella I ever met.
Quagmire's team takes the left side of the house and Peter's team will take the right.
Do I have a cobweb in my hair? It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.
We say we spent the night and everyone thinks we're the bravest kids in the world. Especially Lois.
If we had a teacup, this would be like playing find the teacup in the bedsheet, like I do with my Aunt Sophia.
Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here, and Istanbul is in this general area, then who the hell is that?
Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire were seen bolting out of the supposedly haunted house after one half-hour, leaving only their pride and twin trails of urine behind them.
Mr Shackleford says if I don't learn it I won't be able to function in the real world.
Keep goin' until you come to a highway that bisects it at a 45-degree angle.
Well, I was gonna try to sell you some Handsome Cream, but I can see you already bought out the store.
According to my uncle, who's a real whiz with volcanos, a volcano is coming this way.
$200?! That's more than I spent on all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.
Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny - he fought in Vietnam, he's an exorcist, but there is one thing that terrifies him.
Peter, that was our emergency money. And your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.
Watch who you're calling a child, because if I'm a child, you know what that makes you?
A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here and be lectured by a pervert.
She's got a point. You're the white version of a black guy who's not good with his money.
The noise was good, but I thought they phoned in a lot of the funk.
I guess you can tell him I said hi. But don't make me sound desperate.
Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car just broke down. May I use your phone?
I'll try, but I don't know why you think I can get your money back.
I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from marching in my parade. Now get my money.
Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi, this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...
Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed this contract and it offers no cover at all.
And down here in small print it says He's signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it.
I'm gonna call my mother right now and tell her to tell that chimp across the street...
This is so degrading. This is worse than the time I was at the Friars Club and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.
Lois, I appreciate the marshmallow and fish casserole, but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.
Yes. It spread through his body so fast, but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...
They better not be expecting money. I gave at church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.
Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.
But here in our little village of Anatevka, you might say each one of us...
Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came to Temple with me. You're a nice family.
But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!
Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?
Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah. I'm OK just the way I...
Now, we got no time to lose. There's gotta be some place in America where you can take a spiritual ceremony that begins a lifetime commitment and blow through it in about 20 minutes.
How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere there's a portrait of you getting prettier.
You-you are a very funny man. Men be acting all like zombies at the mall.
Oh, I got so many of 'em, too. I know, I know. Shh.  But later...
I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.
I see what you're saying. The Jewish are just like us. No better, no worse.

We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room for terrific shows... like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared...
Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes, we might have a shot.
I tell you, Brian, I can't believe that this guy's just lying there taking it.
Our sex is so dull for you that you got to fantasize about George Clooney?
Brian, if I choose to make stool in my pants right now... you're the only one here to change me.
I swear to God, these kids are gonna make me put a bullet through my head.
Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? I fall asleep for 10 minutes... and you plow the car into a tree?
Oh, my God! You got to pay attention to the road. We could have been killed!
Two Garfield books and the novelization of the movie Caddyshack. Mananananana, said Ty, sinking yet another ball. Mananananana... Hang on.
Peter and Lois were supposed to chaperone Chris' school dance... tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.
You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this parenting thing.
Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said you didn't.
Look, Peter, this second honeymoon was a nice thought... but maybe we should just go home.
But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is on hand for the opening... of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel.
Diane, I am standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel... because they don't allow Asians inside.
Such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson, who has his own room... on permanent reserve. A room which he barely uses.
In fact, last year alone, there were over 27,000 deaths from... chronic liver disease as a result of alcohol abuse.
I guess I'm going through a phase right now... where I'm only attracted to handsome men.
Go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other... across the breakfast table, talking about how much we both like Total?
Stealing Mel Gibson's towels, bathrobes, and Nazi paraphernalia... is one thing, but this is a multi-million-dollar film.
We gotta get rid of this thing for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy... and all the other beloved children's characters.
Seems he left something very valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it.
Man, this is even more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down.
Okay, now, be polite. And for God's sake... don't mention anything about his kid's face.
Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems your son Jake had some vodka... at the school dance and Chris got blamed for it.
There's got to be a way to get back at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.
Well, Mel Gibson, this is one piece of crap... the world will never have to suffer through.
Well, that may be. But what we're all forgetting is... anyone who doesn't want to go to war is gay.
You know, I know this is the wrong time to be star struck... but Mel Gibson is shooting at us.
In local news, a Buddy Cianci Junior High School student... has been arrested for possession of drugs.
The student has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service... and is a very bad boy.
We've just got to accept the fact that Fox has to make room for terrific shows...
Well, I suppose if all those shows go down the tubes, we might have a shot.

Oh, my God! You got to pay attention to the road. We could have been killed!
Hey! Knock it off! look, you kids are obviously in need of some type of activity.
Two Garfield books and the novellzation of the movie Caddyshack, Mananananana, said Ty, sinking yet another ball. Mananananana- Hang on.
Peter and lois were supposed to chaperone Chris' schooI dance... tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.

Much better than that time I experimented with gene splicing. lois, quick question. Do we have any TylenoI?
In fact, last year alone, there were over 27,000 deaths from... chronic liver disease as a result of alcohoI abuse.
I guess I'm going through a phase right now... where I'm only attracted to handsome men.
Go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other... across the breakfast table, talking about how much we both like TotaI?
And it's healthy for us, too. Oh, God! It's starting already! lois, we are screwed.

NARRATOR: In the television comedy world, the people are entertained... by two separate yet equally important types of shows.
Traditional sitcoms that get laughs out of everyday situations... like trying to fix your own plumbing or inviting two dates to the same dance.
And this week in Home Ec, we're teaching your kids... how to make bundt cake.
The school band offers a wide variety of instruments... from the kettledrum to the trombone.
I like meeting Chris's teachers. This ought to be more interesting than... that time I met Ted Danson.
Good evening, parents. I'm Ms. Clifton. I'd like for you to fill out these... contact information sheets. Now, who would like to pass them out?
You're very knowledgeable, the kids might knock you down a few pegs... which would be good for you.
You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois. I probably have a lot to offer young people.
I thought your father's name was Cocoa, and he was hit by a milk truck!
What? You've done nothing but eat Breyer's and smoke pot... for the last six months.
If dogs aren't supposed to eat dental floss out of the garbage... why do they make it mint-flavored?
Chris, when I was in school, you know what we used to do... when a teacher gave us a bad grade?
Reassigned? Can I at least come down to your office and talk to you about this?
All right. How about we go around the room and everyone can say... a little something about themselves?
My name is Carlos. And beneath my tough exterior is a boy aching to learn.
Dad, I need some advice. I need to know how to get a girl to like me.
Did I hear my big boy say he's got a crush on some lucky girl?
You know, Chris, I knew this day would come. So, I brought you a condom.
Chris, honey, the way to win a girl is to do something romantic and unexpected.
On my 25th birthday, your father surprised me by showing up... in nothing but a space helmet and moon boots.
God! Just listen to this kid's report on Great Expectations. Miss Havisham should have throwed that cake out so it don't like... mess all up the bitch's house.
I think your problem is you're not communicating in a way... that speaks to their experience.
Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe I should just try... a whole new approach. Thanks.
All right. So's I'm chilling in Verona when my homie busts out with: Yo, Romeo. Check out that biotch Juliet in the window.
Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like, East Coast rappers... and my posse's representing West Side.
Mrs. Lockhart, we just wanted you to know... so you could spare his feelings and let him down gently.
Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose, but do you have a picture of yourself... that I could tape to the back of Lois's head?
Make a flip book of a stick figure whose head gets bigger and bigger... and bigger and then pops?
Maybe you could just get a divorce, and we could live together... in the fort under my bed.
Okay. But I got to give you the password, or you can't get into the fort.
My God, nobody can be this stupid. Not even Peter when he took... that blow to the head and thought he was Larry from Three's Company.
But without a decent education, you could spend the rest of your life... as a ditch digger or a motel maid or a hooker.
Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher that ever told us we could do anything.
What the hell? Be the best damn hooker you can be. O, Captain! my Captain!
I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll have plenty of time to escape... while he's killing Meg. He hates her the most.
That's right, Diane. It appears Ronald Lockhart... has been brutally murdered by his wife, Lana, and a local bear.

A man can wash another man in the merry old land of Oz all right, wait here, Stewie, while Mommy gets the cement blocks.
Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll have plenty of time to escape... while he's killing Meg. He hates her the most.
That's right, Diane. It appears Ronald Lockhart... has been brutally murdered by his wife, Lana, and a locaI bear.
I must say I do feel a strange satisfaction... watching the black ball topple all those self-righteous white pins.
Hey, you want to see what I can do? All right, ready? Check it out.
A scandal at the Quahog Bowling Alley tonight... where a local man, Glenn Quagmire... was charged with peeping in the ladies'room.
You're lucky I've got some extra pull around here... thanks to my 18 medals for heroism.
And in the event of your death... you'd like the insurance policy to be paid to your wife?
All right, all right, look, I know an apology is due here... so, Lois, tell Quagmire you're sorry you had him arrested.
Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby into the world with him running around.
Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy, you know? He's just a little mixed up.
All right. But one more incident like the one at the bowling alley... and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.
I got the idea from when Brian had to wear that cone after his operation.
This is where we monitor all the dressing rooms in the mall... so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.
From this day forth, people are gonna know the name Peter Griffin... even if I have to shout it from the rooftops.
Peter, if you'd just let me talk, I'll explain to you why you shouldn't do this.
Later, Brian. I gotta do something people will remember me for... which is why I've invented a new type of flying machine.
You know, I vaguely recall seeing footage somewhere... of something exactly like this that leads me to believe this probably won't work.
All right... we attack the Rice Krispie guys at dawn, assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.
Brian, this time, I think I got just the thing people will remember me for.
Not like my great-great-uncles, the Siamese twins... who fought each other in the Civil War.
Peter, you have to stop comparing yourself to other people... and find out what's special about you.
In sadder news, the man who held the Guinness World Record... for most drugs ever done by a single human being died today.
Setting this world record is gonna make me famous... just like the world's fattest twins over there.
My cousin Marshall insists if you look past the picture... you can see a spaceship.
Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed to nickel poisoning... causing him to lose his sight.
Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat. I can't see a damn thing.
So we're all gonna have to pitch in and help your father out... now that he's lost his sight.
Nobody took care of me when I lost my arms and legs... and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb.
Hey, Meg, they got a Happy Days spoof in here... but they call it Crappy Days.
This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's gonna remember me for after I die... is being that blind guy.
And I took a dump in the church confessional... which I guess they frown upon if you're not homeless.
If you're heading to the store later... you know, 800-mile drive for me, like, five seconds for you.
You know, since Peter went blind... it's actually been kind of nice not to have to worry about my appearance.
All right, you don't want to come in? Fine. I'll just tie you to this parking meter.
Lois had it on the other night and I was kind of fading in and out.
But, you know, I was watching and I'm wondering, which one is the funny guy?
That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own... which I would never do.
Meg, honey, don't let those awful kids at school... make you feel bad about yourself. I tell you what.
Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out and get you some brand new outfits.
Like the kind I used to play when I was an intern at the hospital.
You'll have to bathe her, feed her and care for her the rest of her life.
Ever since that mega-mall opened across the street... it's been taking away all my business.
You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height.
Well, they've got one that says Porn Star... and another that says Sperm Dumpster and they're all written in glitter.
But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall... where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa... is handing out makeovers.
Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed... by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society.
You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots... at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band.
Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear... as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue.
Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud... can you perform surgery on yourself?
Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie... but business is business. So, let's get this show on the road, huh?
And we thought there might be a place for us to sing on the next album.
Lois, this is the kind of thing... that always resolves itself if you just ignore it, all right?
You mean I'm gonna get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner... and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley, and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!
Being with you just made me feel so... Live from New York... it's Saturday Night!
Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered... in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TVaudience?
And this is for laughing and looking at the camera... during every sketch you've ever been in.
TV HOST: From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem... it's show time at the...
Peter, are you sure Santos and Pasqual... don't mind coming in on a Saturday to serve us drinks?
No, I don't volunteer for anything since I helped those guys... repaint the Sistine Chapel.
Listen, I thought the stuff that was there was kind of lame. So I put this up.
Only a couple of Oreos gone. I'm gonna take the rest home to the cats.
I'll get to you in a moment, sir. I'm gonna have to check... and see if he soiled himself.
I'm gonna need you to step back. All right, Looks like we're clean down here.
This is worse than when they took away my library card... for reading while intoxicated.
Sir, do you know how loud you were reading? The life of a silversmith's apprentice was not an easy one!
You know, for a large, heavyset... black guy, Cleveland's got a cute, little white ass.
Wait a minute. Brian? If that wasn't Cleveland doing it with Loretta... then Loretta's having an affair.
So I guess the only thing left to do... is tell you that Loretta Brown is having an affair.
All we know is it's a skinny white guy... with a tattoo on his left butt cheek.
In Superman II, what is the story with that cellophane S... that Superman rips off his chest and throws at the bad guy?
Well, I admit after a long day at work, I don't always come home... with that Riunite on ice, that's nice mentality.
I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles.
You mean like Cousin Janine who we're polite to but then mock her diabetes... on the drive home?
His wife cheated on him, kicked him out of the house... and he doesn't seem at all affected by it.
Right. I almost got an ulcer after you shelled out $200... for tickets to Crossing Over with John Edward.
Now, the first thing we're gonna do... is take you to a good, old-fashioned, wrestling match.
It is my job. I only ask that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie... as he's already eaten and might throw up.
Why don't you come on over and we can... try to get things back to the way they used to be?
[In pseudo-Czech accent] Perhaps here there are many unsuspecting foxes... to have sex with us.
Glenn, you sure you want to do this? I already told you I forgive you.
Yeah, this will be a lot more fun than last Saturday... when we went to see The Vagina Monologues.
Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns at each other in the house?
Well, now that the mess is cleaned up and we're back from the emergency room... it's time for the last game of the night, Trivial Pursuit.
All right, Brian, this one's for you. What naturally occurring element has the highest melting point of all metals?
Fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, what color are those red fire trucks?
Okay, Brian, Name the 16th century ecumenical body... that marked a major turning point for Christianity in Europe.
What is this, you're gonna talk down to everyone... just because you won a game of Trivial Pursuit?
Well, if you qualify as a genius... the Foundation will give you a $500,000 grant... just to sit around and do whatever you want.
Oh, yeah? Well, would a mentally retarded guy... have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to level half of his house... in celebration of his fantastic test results?
And I'm just calling to let you know... you might want to get yourself tested.
You know, Peter, I hate to say I told you so about not being a genius, but... yeah! In your... face,!
I can't believe this is happening to me. I can never go back to school again.
Not your years of grotesque appearance or awkward social graces... or that Felix Unger-ish way you clear your sinuses.
No piece of paper from the city is gonna tell me... you're any different from the man I married.
Well, you know, I took this test... and it sort of turns out that I'm technically mentally retarded.
And, you know, I just wanted to ask... you know, how do you deal with it?
Do I look like I'm all right? My back is broken and my leg is twisted!
Oh, my God. I could get away with anything. And on the sixth day, God said: 'Let the Earth bring forth the living creatures and...'
This man seems bent on diluting the already watered-down significance... of the elevated hand slap.
Yeah, I remember his dad dropped him off at school in it... one time when he was a freshman.
And the best way to do that is to show what a terrible father Cleveland is.
And tonight on CBS News... seven Saudi soldiers sodomize... several of Saddam 's southern settlement squatters.
Or at this point, would it be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway?
Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say in your defense... as to why this court should return custody of your children to you?
But I'm the only one who can see him and hear him... so I'll let everyone know what he's saying and doing.
Ghost That Never Lies... did you witness the events that took place on that fateful day?
And I think it's a bum rap that just because I'm retarded... that makes me an unfit parent.
There are plenty of unfit parents out there who aren't retarded... but they get to keep their kids.
I just want them back, Your Honor, and you're the only one who can help me.
I would put you in a place where you would be removed from the general public.
Perhaps locked in a big, secure building with other dangerous people... for a pre-determined period of time... based on the nature and degree of your offense.
Just yesterday, when we saw her at the country club... she had a cigarette in her hand.
Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make... a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back?
I would be perfect for your show... because I know how to talk dirty to the ladies.
You see, his wife left him and he's been kind of Ionely... confused about what he really wants.
But I figured I got a few days of free booze and food... before they kick me off. I could use a vacation.
Talk to him and tell him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble?
I got to tell you. I don't know what she would possibly see in Count Chocula.
Who gets to stay, and who takes the bus ride home... it's up to Brooke.
First thing tomorrow, we're going down to Goldman's Pharmacy... and get some astringent to get rid of that thing.
And maybe you can cut out when I said junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing.
I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were one of those criminals... who broke in and destroyed my entire stock of acne medication.
Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you were younger.
Yeah, I mean, I know I was skeptical at first... but I got to be honest, I've never felt this way about anyone before.
I bet your stories will make me laugh so hard, I'll shoot milk out of my nose.
Well, it wasn't as bad as the evening I spent with Glenn and his mother.
Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last message... or any of the other ones. Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...
She told me she loved me on what used to be a hit TV show.
I can't believe I got sucked into that phony reality world... just like everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking.
I mean, you know, I don't even know, say, for example, if you have a room up there.
You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now... you'll probably get a full page in the yearbook.
Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day, and I always give you the same answer.
God, I don't think I could have been any clearer the last time I turned him down.
Wait a minute, what the hell's a tab? Does that mean I don't gotta pay?
You know, in case I want to rub out that easy one... before I get Lois into bed tonight.
COMMENTATOR: [On TV] And now back to The Kids' Choice Awards... with host Paula Poundstone.
Do you know what I do, Meg? I spit in your mouth while you sleep.
So, a wild guess here... but from the looks of your arm hair, I'm guessing you're Italian?
All right, you guys, I got eight crates of ipecac from Mort, all on my tab.
Now, whoever goes the longest without puking... gets the last piece of pie in the fridge.
You know, I don't know if you guys had any of that pie already... but that is some tasty stuff. That's from the bake sale that Lois...
Yes, if only you were this discerning... when you picked that happening Bruce Jenner hairdo.
My God, I haven't been this exhilarated since Brian took me to see Les Miserables.
For this evening's performance... the role of Jean Valjean will be played by Kirk Cameron.
Unbelievable! Oh, my God! How lucky are we, huh? Hey, Stewie, what are you doing tonight? Oh, nothing. Just watching Kirk Cameron play Jean Valjean.
Are you out of your mind? You can't sell me, you fat son of a bitch!
All right, Lois, I don't want this to ruin our date night, so I'll make it up to you.
Yeah, you don't know how hard it was to find one of those in English.
I hope I don't make any social faux pas... like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's dinner party.
And I was gonna go out with him when I was ready to settle for him.
I'm not gonna lie down for some frat-boy bastard... with his damn Teva sandals and his Skoal Bandits... and his Abercrombie & Fitch long-sleeved, open-stitched... crew-neck Henley smoking his sticky buds out of a soda can... while watching his favorite downloaded Simpsons episodes every night!
That is exactly the kind of idiot you see at Taco Bell at 1:00 in the morning.
It seems like only yesterday... he was just a stranger videotaping me through the window.
You can't just disappear for three months and then suddenly decide... you want him back! You can't have him!
All right, Meg, according to the contract... every night, you have to put on my pajamas.
Colin Farrell, so I was talking to my wife, Dixie, the other day... and she was saying that you weren't a very good actor.
I say, I think this is how you change a tire. But what do I know? I'm just a baby!
Here's your iPod, so you can listen to The Streaks while you gasp for air.
I don't have a dual cassette player... so, you know, I had to hold the tape recorder up to the radio... so the quality is kind of sucky... but, you know, all the songs describe my feelings.
I thought we were going to go all the way and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun.
Hey, Stewie, there's something thunking around in the trunk of my car... and I can't get in there 'cause somebody busted the lock.
Well, I really don't know how this happened... but I guess this is the last time I get to see you.
Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you want to be with me... not because you have to.
How about we fire up the old Segway... and find a nice quiet field to do long division in?
Chris, would you run and get some milk? And be sure to take it from the back.
I have to do laundry, then I have a piano lesson... then I have to make dinner. I am so busy. Better hurry.
You know, she bought me something yesterday... but I am not going to tell you what it is. I want you to guess. Just close your eyes.
All right, so I'm at the DMV the other day. Long lines. Long lines at the DMV.
It is settled, May. Our parents have consented... and you and I are to be married on the first warm, sunny day of spring.
God, you're right, Brian, I'm out of control... but I don't know what to do. I'm just hooked on the rush of shoplifting.
For those of you wondering... what I've been writing down as we go to commercial... it's a cat. Just a cat.
In other news, police are still looking for the culprit... who stole a valuable Matisse painting from the Quahog Museum of Art.
Also, scientists announced today... that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer.
I mean, it really helped Peter out... when he became obsessed with that fantasy world of his.
You know, Lois, we're just lucky... we got this under control before the police caught onto you.
Oh, crap. All right, look, just take it easy, Joe. All right, Lois will go peacefully.
Okay, now when we get to your mother's cage, say hello... but don't drag your ass, 'cause I want to go the reptile house.
Oh, it is so good to see all of you. How is everything at home?
I felt a total lack of ethical integrity... in her readiness to abandon her children and start a life of her own.
The only upside is that it's given me time to think about why I ended up in here.
I guess I was stealing, because I was so sick of the same old routine.
And I was trying to fill that hole with all kinds of expensive objects and things.
I did this to myself... so I'm just gonna have to lay back and let the penal system teach me a lesson.
If we're gonna hide out here in Asiantown we have to find a place to live.
Come on, kids, we've been through worse. Meg, you remember when you found out... your gynecologist never finished med school?
We'll all have to get jobs, but I'm sure we'll each find something we can do.
Damn! I say, I seem to have sewn a shoe to my hand, may I go to the nurse?
You're probably asking yourself, Which way are they gonna go? Are they gonna make a diving-board head-injury joke? Are they gonna make an AIDS joke? Or are they gonna make a joke about the fact... that his last name sounds suspiciously like 'anus'?
Look, honey, it was very sweet of you to break me out of jail... but I did something wrong.
Okay, so on the count to three, you try to push me out of the ring...
Yes, that's very hot, and I'll deaI with it in the morning... but right now, I am exhausted.
Perhaps you should worry a little less about your pride... and a little more about the creepy-crawlies... shawshanking their way out of your balloon knot.
Thank God I finally get some time away from the eviI monkey in my closet.
The one with the civiI war, the one with the cocaine... or the one with the fancy hats?
No. No, I just thought you might want some extra seamen... on your poop deck.
You could become rich beyond your wildest dreams... by selling these fine products over the phone.
Okay, girls. Are you all ready to play? all right, then. One, two, three. Green light.
Newport would like to extend a speciaI welcome... to all those here today who have children stationed overseas in Iraq.
Well, Daddy, you didn't want Peter in your boat... so team Griffin is gonna give you a run for your money.
We must keep this from the serfs lest they gain literacy... and threaten the landed gentry.
And you know what? I'm gonna take that chance... my father never let me take when I was younger.
But before you go thinking it's all seriousness... the first Friday of every month is Wacky-Tacky-Tie Day... so, you know, start thinking up some fun tacky ties to wear.
Lois, could I be a son of a bitch and impose on you... to sign one of your flyers for me.
Listen, sugar, I've seen your stuff. You're a breath of fresh air in my stoma.
Oh, and if Cookie Monster calls, tell him I'm not talking to him... untiI he gets out of rehab.
That coffee mug you have on your desk that says, Life's a beach... that's dangerously close to the word bitch, isn't it?
And, you know, between you and me, I think it's a stitch... but some of the other employees have found it offensive.
Wow, Lois, look at you. You're like Britney Spears... except you're not a fat guy.
Lois, I got your new headshots, and I set up a shoot for you... over at Glamour next Monday... but, sugar, you're gonna need these to stay on top.
Lois, if you being a modeI means you're going to be eye-candy... for the whole town, then I ain't going for it.
I am going to the top, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.
I was just out with some of the girls, and you're not gonna believe this.
Now, then. I'm going to do something I call the compliment sandwich... where I say something good, then talk about where you need improvement... and then end with something good.
Listen, if you're ever looking for a change of scenery... we could sure use a fellow like you in Cincinnati.
I'm really worried about her, Mr. Pewterschmidt... and I figured I'd come to you since you were always good at reeling her in.
Well, Lois was always a wild stallion... but don't worry. I know how to controI her.
You know, Brian, there was a note in the suggestion box that says: Stewie should eat a steaming bag of...
Well, I'm not gonna say the last word, but I think you know what it is.
Don't think about coming back and shooting up the place... because security has your picture.
You're not leaving this room untiI you agree to stop this modeling thing... once and for all.
I mean, if Lois wants to be a modeI... we don't got any right to stop her.
Well, now that you say you're fine with it... to be honest, I'm not really sure I wanna do it anymore.
I think all I really wanted was the freedom to know I could... and now I have it because I have you.
Tomato soup, grilled cheese, and a weak cup of tea... is the best lunch in my book.
Well, I'm Brian and... gosh, if I'm not being too forward, it's lovely to meet you, Miss Parks.
If I drive, I'll have to have a bunch of drinks first... because I am very self-conscious about my driving.
That'll be more pathetic than that game of Marco Polo I played with Helen Keller.
My God, you know, if I could just take all the orphans in the world... and just, you know, buy a farm somewhere... and let them all run free, you know.
I mean, if I could take all the black people in the world... and just, you know, just buy a farm somewhere and let them all...
By the way, Bonnie... we just finished reading The Da Vinci Code at my book club.
Well, fine, Brian. If that girI is more important to you than me... then I guess I'll have to find a new best paI.
Hey, you almost done in the john? 'Cause we're late for darts. all done, Peter.
I mentioned to Shauna that they ought to change the name of James Woods High... to Martin Luther King, Jr., and she really ran with it.
Oh, that's okay. I had a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of the show.
I think it has a lot to do with that woman... you've been spending so much time with.
By the way, I just want to remind everybody... to put their e-mall address on the list in the back there... so we can send you our quarterly newsletter.
A little hint: all the answers have to do with something here at the schooI.
Let me just say, I'm all in favor of renaming the schooI after Dr. King.
Yes! This is more exciting than that time I got to ride the washing machine.
Okay, let me just go ahead and stop you right there. You sound terrible, all right?
And you look like if I touched you, you'd be sticky... and frankly, you smell bad.
Well, actually, you know when you smell something and it gets stuck in there... and you can sort of taste it?
Listen, at least I wasn't trying to change the name of the schooI... to impress my girlfriend.
Oh, man, I thought maybe you could stick around... and, you know, maybe you and me could be pals.
His sweater was neatly folded on the grave... so we went back to the car... and the severed hook was hanging from the door handle... because the calls were coming from inside the house.
I brought it from home, because I don't like the creamed corn they have here.
Listen, I'm sorry for everything that's happened between us... and I figure, I don't know, I thought maybe we could be friends again, huh?
What do you say? I kind of miss sleeping at the foot of your bed.
Yeah, I think you're really going to appreciate... all the subtle nuances in my performance.
See? For example, see how even though this other guy is talking... your eye is drawn to me.
You know, it's bad enough that Peter and I were fighting... but ever since he met James Woods, it's like I don't even exist.
Do you really care about a man who used to try and pick up girls... at the Miss USA Pageant?
I'm Peter. What do you say you and me go get a couple of beers, maybe we could...
Brian, I know you're upset now, but if there's anything I've learned in this life... is that you can't let the little things...
I don't know, Peter, I had this crazy idea... that you and I were supposed to have dinner tonight.
Boy, I haven't been this creeped out since I saw that episode of Star Trek.
If I whispered in your ear that Commander Worf's head... looks like a fanny, would you join me in a laugh?
Boy, I tell you, Brian, James Woods has been getting kind of obsessive... ever since you and me started hanging out again.
We got to come up with some crazy scheme like the kids on That '70s Show.
And I think I got it. all right, that's the last of the Reese's Pieces.
As insulted as Kitty Kelley... when people accuse her of taking liberties with her best-selling tell-alls.
Peter, we have a family to feed. We all count on you to provide for us.
I must look like a bigger loser than when I was on that game show.
Okay, Peter. Listen closely and tell us... if this is a song by Icelandic vocallst Bjork... or, the rantings of former comedian Bobcat Goldthwait.
I tell you, fellows, if I don't find some fish out there soon... my family's gonna go hungry.
I guess, would be the centraI theme of what I'm trying to get across here.
You gotta drink if you did the thing that the person says they never did.
I never gave a reach around to a spider monkey... while reciting the pledge of allegiance.
I never picked up an illegaI allen at Home Depot... to take home and choke me, while I touched myself.
In locaI news, we have more on the approach of Hurricane RuPauI... which is working his or her way up the coast.
Not only will I be able to put food on the table, and pay all my bills...
They sank, I guess, would be the one thing... to take away from this part of the seminar.
When we come back, I'll show you... how eye contact can make or break any business relationship.
I know, sweetie. I'm sad, too. But you're making a scene. all our friends are here.
And whoever's toe that is, I appreciate your enthusiasm... but I think, you can stop.
And if you look off the left side of the ship... you'll see a bunch of homosexuals.
Thanks for saving our family, now scram. And besides, he's been great with the kids.
Fine. I can see, I'm not wanted here. Maybe I'll just find my own place.
You know what? Maybe I'll just go take up my old job... as a construction worker in New York.
You know, I know, your head must be turned upside down... by this whole Peter thing.
I'll admit this is an emotionaI time for me but you and I are married... and that's the way it's gonna stay.
Guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Lois is the only woman for me.
I once built that time machine out of a DeLorean. all right, past. Here I come.
You know, I'd leave my ass behind... if it wasn't so perfectly attached to my sternum.
Look, Peter, I know what you're trying to do... but it's not gonna work. I'm married to Brian.
I'm looking for a car that's been tricked out to look like an ice-cream truck.
I'm sorry, Lois, I was mistaken. I thought you threw the ball in there... but I can see now you still have it.
Perhaps you'd like to see... what Lois and the fat man have been up to in your absence.
And to think, Brian, I was, like, a day away from having sex with you.
I was gonna push those beds together... and take you around the freaking world, Brian.
Chris, I'm just as serious as I was when I saw PauI Reiser do standup.
Come on, Karen. Do you hate your body so much... you have to reduce every painting of the female form to pornography?
Then he made a joke about a negro. But Robin laughed, so it was okay.
I'm going to teach you the lesson that it is not okay to be a freshman. all right, Mr. Griffin. Jobs you think you would be suited for.
Wow, that sounds even better than when I got paid to take part in that study.
I got a case of wine coolers, so we can drink every time Ryan seethes.
But 6,000 miles and all the dope I could smoke... still couldn't separate me from my problems.
Oh, my God. This one time, we got so baked... we ended up eating all the food the World Health Organization... had airlifted in. Man, those villagers were so pissed.
Finally, I'm one of those guys who can't wait to get to work in the morning.
And by the way, the word colored still flies down there. So, get your fill.
Hey, how you doing? Give me a word, any word at all... and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickeI.
Listen, I am swamped... but Mom has kept me up to date on everything you're doing... and I think it's just great. Hanging up now.
My dad got a job at the brewery and he gets lots of free beer.
Excellent. As soon as I release this biologicaI toxin... into the world's water supply, I will rule the world.
Mr. Griffin, since you can't controI your drinking... you've been demoted to the shipping department.
Mr. Griffin, although I may not fully understand Opie's management style... he has proven himself a more competent employee than you.
I'm tired of always scrounging around on the bottom rung of society... getting kicked around by the Man.
This is bigger news than when I toured Europe... with that musicaI rendition of My Left Foot.
Arthur, if you are able to draw the sword from the stone... and prove to me you truly are the sole king of Camelot...
This is amazing. You've got the biggest hut in the village and all these servants... and you've only spent $1.50.
That's a hell of a lot less than I had to spend... to go see that piece-of-crap remake of Bewitched.
Guess what? I'm a Clippers fan. all ticketed passengers for Flight 2378 to Reno, Nevada...
It is a thrill to watch him dig a ditch or lift a jug of water or participate in a hunt.
Dad, don't you see? This is a wonderfuI place... and you're just using it to escape from your problems at home.
You will be punished for your decadent ways on the first day of Radaman. You...
I'm not gonna be able to do it now. I'm not... OK, OK. I know.
Stop making that face. What are you doing? He makes that face and it makes me laugh.
You know what? Just turn around. I don't care where you look. Just look over there.
He had a note... He had a note from his doctor. He brought a note from his doctor.
Let him do it. Let him do the tape. Don't blame me. It was the chicken. He was...
I'm just telling for your own benefit. I'm very aware that I'm watching a play right now.
You know, Lois, if we leave now, we can catch the Emmy for best documentary.
Wait a minute. You can't fool me that easily. You are not watching the Emmys.
Our top story, beloved entertainer Bob Hope briefly came back to life, only to die in a tragic motorcycle accident.
In other news, actor David Hyde Pierce created a major controversy at the Emmys, when a trouser malfunction caused him to expose his testicles.
Well, now you know how George W Bush felt when he showed up in Vietnam.
As you know, one call equals a billion people, which means 20 billion people were offended by this.
Well, Peter, I'm flattered you came to me for help. We'll have more after this.
We're back. To answer your question, if you want to control content, start your own TV station.
Dad's starting his own TV station, but I'm not supposed to tell Mom because she'll just bitch him out.
Hi there. I'm Peter Griffin, and you're watching PTV, with your favourite shows as nature intended them - with all the sex, violence, swearing and farts intact, like in All in the Family, where Archie got the Jeffersons to move.
Brian, that's a great idea. That's exactly what we need to take PTV to the next level.
Hi, and welcome to The Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour, a wonderful look back on all the partial nudity network television used to offer.
Norman Mailer will read an excerpt from his latest book, and we have a girl from Omaha who's hiding a banana.
There are worse things for children than TV, like when Peter baby-sat the neighbours' kid.
Couldn't find your toys, so why don't you just play with this blow-dryer and these rattles?
Guess that's it. You probably want me out of your hair, so here's the Drano in case there's a clog.
It's one thing if a network runs inappropriate shows I can't do anything about, but I won't have it happening in my house.
We're here on the I95 overpass doing our first segment, I Dare You To Crap Off Of That.
We'll spend the day crapping off things that others have dared us to crap off.
It was inexcusable, Peter, and Stewie may never be able to ride in the car again.
Peter, that's it. I asked you to stop this and you didn't listen to me.
Mr Griffin, that was terrific, but I'm here to tell you that as of today, PTV is shut down.
We're tired of you infecting people with your smut. It's an epidemic. It must be contained.
Well, Mr FCC, you can stop PTV, but you can never stop people from being who they are.
Until you and all of Quahog start to clean up your act, like when Ozzy Osbourne stopped biting heads off bats.
Lois, these eggs are scrambled. I thought for sure you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.
You know what I mean - when you... lubed up... toothpaste in my... cherry... Episcopalian... extension cord... wetness... with a parking ticket - that is the best.
I know it's a little extreme, but when it comes to our children, it's better to err on the safe side, right?
No. You know, if everybody was as closed-minded as you, the world wouldn't have some of its most inspired creations.
You can have sex, just no moaning, no tongue kissing, no thrusting, no movement whatsoever.
Sorry. I haven't had sex in two weeks. I'm just a little on edge lately.
I thought this FCC thing was a good idea at first, but it's just gone way too far.
This government's FCC is trying to take the farts away from television, and all the sex and nudity and all the poop.
Well, I say it's wrong. These things are part of the fabric of American life.
Yeah? Well, I can prove to you that that's a bunch of bull. Look around you.
And the Pentagon? Well, you look me in the eye and tell me it doesn't look like a big anus.
This is gonna be a fun day. Much better than that day I tried TAG body spray for sick cats.
OK, everyone, Alan Thicke will be up in a minute to answer your hate mail, but first, the winners of this year's costume contest, the A-Team with the real black guy.
I read your article too. You should spend less time working for the paper and more time working on that novel you've been working on.
I was using the Daily Shopper to shoo away a homeless person and I saw your article.
Excuse me, it's been brought to my attention that a few bad apples are smoking marijuana.
Peter, it's been two weeks. Don't you think it's time to take off your A-Team costume?
Yeah, I guess so, but part of me wished we could just be the A-Team forever, you know?
Hey, if we could fix that wobbly chair, think of what else we could do for our community.
In 2005, a group of local misfits won a costume contest at an '80s TV convention.
If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
So I said to him, Brown liquor before Labor Day? What, do you work for Esquire?
Oh, Brian, how droll. We'll have to put that into a cartoon, or as we call it, an illustrated laughing square.
I can't believe they fired you. How come you never told us you dropped out of college?
I was only one course shy of graduating and I just cracked under the pressure.
Louis, the French people really wanna thank you for your services as king, but, it's just not working out and we've decided to go another way, so...
I just heard the dog got fired. Did I miss it? Did he cry yet?
Well, if you only had one class left why don't you just go back and finish?
If this is Mom, send money because we're college students and we need money for books and highlighters and ramen noodles and condoms for sexual relations with our classmates.
Now, Louie Anderson, our first test is Friday, and if you don't pass you are out of the class.
Don't you worry, sad little girl. The A-Team'll get your beloved kitty down. Ready, boys?
Fine. I'll be out on the quad. You know what I've discovered since I've been in college?
You know, I haven't taken a shower since we got here. I totally reek, man. Check this out.
I didn't come back to college to cheat my way through. I wanted to do it on my own.
You know, Brian, before you came along I was so depressed I was planning to kill myself.
Dammit, Helen, get the hell off my back or so help me... so help me...
Only way I'll pass is if I cheat. If I do, what was the point of coming back to college?
No, it's not. It's Roger Williams Park and we're here to stop you from destroying it.
No, you'll just roll out and dust yourself off and lumber to your hideout, defeated.
Yeah, cos I know this guy who took his car in for an oil change.
Well, you got a lot of work to do. We should get out of your hair.
We were ready to save Roger Williams Park and we got sidetracked by idle conversation.
That's exactly it. We didn't stay focused. I mean, we were right there, and then we just... Somehow we just... I mean... It...
I try to keep 'em separated, but I woke up this morning and they were sort of together.
I couldn't do it. I thought I'd be able to finish this time, but I just don't have what it takes to be a college graduate.
You can't give up. You could study tonight. I think if you work at it...
What's the point? I thought I could help people with this A-Team thing, but it turns out I'm as useless as that nude Playboy spread of Debbie Gibson.
Unless there was some kind of team of people who could get you there in time.
Doesn't matter how it turned out. I finished what I started, which means I have my pride, and that's something.
When you take a break from your lipstick, how about taking me to the park?
Stewie, that's not nice. Don't grab Mommy's pants like that. You could really hurt her.
Shame on us, Rupert. How dare we succumb to boredom while she continues to breathe?
How come I'm never employee of the month? It's the worstjob since the Sand People choir.
Really? I thought you said she was ugly. Oh, you mean kiss up to her.
I asked around and everybody said you liked animals, so I organised a surprise cockfight.
Stewie's really been acting out a lot at home and I was just wondering, how's he been behaving at school?
At the end of the day, if you're exhausted and your face is wet, it means you did a good job.
Chris, a little hard work can do wonders. Just look at how they built the pyramids.
All peoples must go through hard times. We Jews are getting ours out of the way early.
I wanted to tell you Opie will not be receiving employee of the month. He's being promoted.
It's time you take an interest. Starting today, I want you to spend more time with Stewie.
OK. You can make a box fort. See? Here's a box. You can pretend it's a fort.
There's no better place for a father and son to get to know each other than a ball game.
Peter, did you take Stewie to a strip club? He smells like sweat and fear.
Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon is not exactly their A squad. I saw bullet wounds.
Listen, things here aren't working out any more, and I was wondering, can I come live with you and Janet for a while?
Wow, kiddo. You know, I'd love that, but I don't know if now is the best time.
Maybe next year, OK? I'll see you Friday night. Tell your mother I sent the cheque.
All I'm saying is that you just need to find an activity that you and Stewie can share.
You know, if you get sweaty and want to take your shirt off, that'd be just fine.
Peter, when I said bond with Stewie, this is not what I had in mind. I am furious with you.
What's the matter with you, fat man? Stop her. Help me, you fool. You traitor.
Get out of here, you spineless oaf. And by the way, I faked all those bowel movements.
I feel awful. We were getting along and now he hates me. How do I get him to like me?
I know you're mad, but when you see where I'm taking you, you'll change your mind.
Well, I done seen about everything, but I sure enough ain't seen your boy, nohow.
You must sing. If you don't, they'll make you do a Christmas movie with Tim Allen.
Meg, that's not nice. Old people have a lot to offer society. Just look at Kim Cattrall.
He'll follow Jonathan Dolgen's footsteps with a POD deal at Touchstone. Are you all right?
Fat man, I'm not sure how to say this without sounding cheesy, but, well, you really came through for me today, so I...
Well, Jesse, I guess we've got to find some other way to spend our evenings.
I am so gonna cheat on Lois right now. I don't care if she finds out.
I'm skipping my physical to go have steaks with the guys and I don't want Lois to know.
Um... What the hell, I'll just ask it. Why did we need the horse suit?
All right, let's start the bidding. Jennifer, how much do you bid on the dinette set?
The doctor said I was too healthy, you know? In too good of shape. Don't even know how.
HÃ¤gar the Horrible, if you keep up that lifestyle of pillaging and turkey legs, you'll be dead in a month.
Mr Griffin, you're going to expire in a month. This is your driver's licence, isn't it?
I'm afraid you are going to die when you watch these Dean Martin celebrity roasts.
You are a Cancer, right? You were born in July? On to these test results.
Hey, if I'm fat, then Stewie's fat too because we wear the same size Onesie.
This is more exciting than that time I saw Bobby McFerrin fall down those stairs.
They get so doped up on sleeping pills and liquor, an earthquake wouldn't wake them up.
My God. How does she sleep knowing she has to funnel this old duffer's hog?
Toss the ball, catch it in the cup, dump it out of the cup, toss it, and catch it in the cup again.
The ball is on a string and attached to the cup so there's no worry if you don't catch the ball.
Why spend another day not catching a ball in a cup when you could be catching a ball in a cup?
I'll get to meet that ass Stone Phillips. He's the kind of guy you hate till he's inside you.
Wait. It's OK because the ball is on a string and attached to the cup.
I can't wait to meet the lunatic. I bet he's weirder than that commercial I saw.
I was so traumatised they sent me here. I guess they must have forgotten about me.
That's a great idea. He can bring his sling blade and order some French-fried potatoes.
That's the way it is. It's nobody's fault. Meg. But I've decided to do something about it.
I'm gonna help make this a fat man's world by establishing the National Association for the Advancement of Fat People.
Well, I want to tell you that Marian and I both appreciate what you've done.
I've prepared an agenda for our organisation, what we want from the community as fat people with pride.
Hey, guys. I'm going for a run. Do me a favour and keep Marian company while I'm gone.
We should let it sit here for a couple of weeks and see if it pickles.
If after three weeks it pickles, then she's real and we both have to buy Patrick a steak.
You don't deserve to have sex with me. I'm gonna eat the whore out of you.
I love Jackie Gleason. Hey, take a look at what I bought at this TV convention.
This just in. The body of a local fat man was found murdered in Quahog Park last night.
Since the first victim at Quahog Park, three more men have been killed, all of them very very fat.
And now he's a dead man. And we're all next. The fat-guy strangler's gonna get us.
People, people. I know what'll make us feel better. Let us sing the NAAFP anthem.
My God, look at you fat bastards. I bet none of you can even find your own penis.
Find your penis for a dollar. Find your penis, one dollar. One dollar, find your penis.
Until they find the fat-guy strangler, we will stay here. Victor, don't lean against that.
That's for rolling up the window when I tried to jump into the General Lee.
I did mean to kill those fat guys, but I never meant to hurt you.
Patrick, did you see how that rock hit me in the face? It was like, right in the kisser.
I was just upstairs and there's a half-dead fat guy eating a dead fat guy.
Why don't you come into the dining room? The table's all set for your birthday dinner.
And if you could go ahead and sit at the kids' table, that'd be great.
Oh, God. Not this again. Francis, why the hell is this always an issue with you?
Because I love this family and I don't want my grandson to burn in hell.
Now, wait a minute. I did have a chubby kid on a raft earlier today.
I'll talk to him, Lois, but when my dad wants something, it's like sex with Kobe Bryant.
Nothing says eat up like a bleeding half-naked Jew nailed to a piece of wood.
I don't know, ease up on the whole Jesus-ay Christ-ay, if you catch my drift?
All right, Dad. I don't want you to hate me, so I'll make a deal with you.
If we get Stewie baptised, you and all other old people have to acknowledge and be aware there's crap in the corners of your mouth.
Old people are gross, no matter how cute they try to be on Desperate Housewives.
Oh, my God. Did you see? Did you see how old and ugly they are?
Stewie Griffin, I baptise you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Mr and Mrs Griffin, I've examined your son and he is suffering from toxic anaemia, which has weakened his immune system.
This is no worse than when I rented out your uterus to those inner-city immigrants.
Sounds dangerous. Be careful next time you're at confession talking about cheating on your wife with that drag queen.
At least you're in no danger, since you only visit church to leave your self-delivered, half-dead newborns on the step.
That's it. Keep laughing. When I get out of here, you're going to get it!
Tonight on Night Court, love is in the air when Judge Harry's old school flame comes to town.
Then a child's death could mean the case of Arnie Becker's life on LA Law.
Hi. My name's Peter. I'm a Jehovah's Witness, here to spread the good news of the story of Jesus.
He would travel from place to place putting things right that once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap would be the leap home.
Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment. It's a portal, an opening, through which all light, rejuvenation, joy and ecstasy may enter the human form.
Honey, now I want you to visualise Lindsay Lohan naked, doing a backwards crab walk.
You want to find religion, all you got to do is look in your heart.
Peter, I know this is important to you. But I don't want to see you humiliated.
This is church. A new church, created by a man brave enough to follow his own vision.
Fonzie's cool, Brian. Deep down, I think we all secretly yearn to be Italian and stupid.
A reading from the letters of Potsie to the Tuscaderos. Yea, and did Fonzie downstairs cometh from his apartment above the garage and sayeth he, 'Reassembleth will I the pieces of my motorcycle though I suffereth from temporary blindness. ' 'And, yea, for I am holy, befriendeth I will Sticks Downy, the only Negro in Wisconsin. '
Dammit. I haven't been this dizzy since I did those helium whippets at that birthday party.
I never thought you could ever embarrass me more than you did at Cousin Mary's wedding.
If anyone knows of any reason why these two should not be married, let him speak now.
It was just a bunch of sheep singing songs and listening to ridiculous tall tales!
Because all is right when you welcome Fonzie into your life. Fonzie be with you.
Reverend, I gotta talk to you. Last night I had sex with a teenage blonde and her mom.
That's quite a story, but there's no confession so there's really no reason for you to tell me.
Let us pause to reflect on the sacred mystery of Richie's elder brother Chuck, who ascended the stairs with his basketball in season one and never came down again.
Yeah. And La Isla Bonita - not a real place. I looked it up, bought a globe, couldn't find it.
No, no... Well, him too. I read somewhere. I think it was in, like, Stuff or so...
I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back, and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai are gonna take you down, man!
It's all right, Brian. I guess the Church of the Fonz was just a bad idea.
If you managed to inspire even one person to embrace those values, you were a success.
Last night I had this crazy dream I was eating a sheep and now my pillow's gone.
See you, Lois. And like I tell you every day, if I come back in the afternoon and you're having sex with somebody, I'll kill you both. Thanks to effective treatments, Magic Johnson down to one AID.
Oh, God. Did I hit that deaf kid again? They ought to put a bell on that guy.
I know we're not here to place blame, but I can't help feeling like this is somehow Meg's fault.
Today I'm going to show you this fascinating episode of Nova that I taped at home for you.
OK, we should get back to work. Next up, does everyone have a lab partner?
Now open your books to page... I'm sorry. Can I show this video of me doing my wife?
What's wrong, Brian? You've just been sitting on the couch ever since you got back.
The accident got me thinking about life and how suddenly it can be taken away.
Wait, wait! You didn't let me finish. I'm not a lesbian. I'm a super huge mega-lesbian!
That you don't have that blue vein up there that some of the bigger ones get.
It was amazing. I got to tell you, he said some things that were exactly what I needed to hear and I was just inspired to get up on that stage. Gotta live life for today, you know.
Brian, when you wear that suit, it looks like you're taking a white poop. But it stuck.
Lois asked me to baby-sit you, so stay here and be quiet. I'll be back after my first set.
And I say, Those are my father's cards. You can't leave them there. He's gonna be mad.  Where am I?
How do you think I feel? You get to look at my great house. I look at that dark thing!
Bite me, man! You seen The Office? Guess you haven't, cos you don't have a TV!
All right, if you don't want it, put it in your napkin. Peter! Put it in your napkin.
I don't care what you think. All my lesbian friends accept me and that's all that matters.
You're my daughter. I would accept you if you were gay, blind or retarded, but you're not.
Oh, yeah. He's... He was right here, right next to me, like, four hours ago.
It's funny. I tried to walk home. A lot of hungry deer walking around at this hour.
Managed to pull it out of the deer's mouth and put it in some ice I got at a 7-Eleven.
I am gonna call his mother Mia Farrow and give her a piece of my mind.
Don't worry. I don't need to go to the hospital. I'll just use this Mr Potato Head piece.
I just want to apolo... You know what? Forget it. I don't need this. I'm outta here.
My God, you're as transparent as your father was when he pretended to be a Hassidic Jew to get off work.
I went into a store last week and they wanted 800 bucks for a TV, but I ussed them down to 500.
It's not a charade, Mom. I am a lesbian. What do I have to do to prove this to you?
Hello. How come I rich and you not? How come you not sell real estate like I do?
How come I sleep with your wife while you at work then pee in your toilet and don't flush?
And sometimes I open the back part and pee there, so when you flush, pee come out.
Let's see what I'm going to put back. I need the Reynolds Wrap and the bathroom tissue.
You know what? I'm not going to need the V8 cos I can just get some tomato juice at the mini-mart down the street.
It's a little more expensive, but that's OK. I like to help out a small business.
Because life can end so abruptly and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
You know, Brian, as smart as you are, you've got to accept that there are some things in life that you just can't control.
You mean the way you can't control the messed-up way that you laugh when you think something's really, really funny?
Yes, I accept that. Your problem is you think that if you're not in control, nothing matters.
I'm so sorry. For the first time in my life, I felt like I belonged.
And I wanted it to be true, so I pretended to be something I'm not.
What do you think, Mike? I mean, if you saw action going on in front of you, would you know instinctively to centre it?
I don't know. Can someone take my soda out of the ice box, please, so it doesn't freeze?
What's this I hear about you up all night with a baby and a dog?
I tell you, Jim, how Carol Channing outlasted that barrage in the second round we'll never know.
I'm just saying it would probably be better for everybody if you had the money tomorrow.
Hey, Peter, I was going through your garbage and I noticed your high school reunion is coming up.
I noticed Lois clipping her toenails and I thought: Oh, man, I gotta get in on that.
Everybody's all got their nice cars and their big, important jobs, and their fancy hats, and their fresh strawberries so big you can eat them like a hand fruit.
Oh, I... You know what? Just give me till next Friday, I'll have it for.
In fact, I was just saying that the other day, to all the guys down at the brewery.
Say, listen, uh, Tom, could you get me a towel? I threw up on the floor.
Our top story tonight, we go live to terrific haircut Bob Costas, as he talks with local man Peter Griffin, who is living his dream of playing for the New England Patriots. Bob?
You know, if it weren't for the Devil, God'd probably go insane, blow his brains out from boredom, you know?
I'm here to kick off the Touchdown of Savings Weekend, at Wilkins Hyundai and Subaru.
We will blitz the competition, and in no time, you'll be driving your new Hyundai or Subaru right to a touchdown.
Do you know he spent $30,000 on a wax sculpture, of Harriet Tubman doing Gwyneth Paltrow?
Look, Peter, I know you're upset because you blew your opportunity with the Patriots but...
I'm calling to challenge you to a grudge match between the Patriots and the London Silly Nannies.
I say, Jenkins, you give me that dirty look one more time, and I've a good mind to get into my PJ's and have a pillow fight with you.
For one guy to stand up to the entire New England Patriots team, that's a winner in my book.
Uh, okay. Um. Z, four, Q, another Q, uh... a third Q and a Batman symbol.
Give me the one free week of maid service and, uh, I'll take the hat rack.
Hey, how much for that fat guy in the circle? I don't see a price tag on that.
All right, players, the answer once again is: It was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of Mars.
Only saying his name backwards can send him back to the fifth dimension where he belongs.
We'll explore. Come and ride a fantasy to a place where dreams fly fast and free
Unless the next words out of your mouth are directions how to get back to the fish skeleton, I'm going to punch you right in the stomach.
Hey, hey, Lois, wants me to go to the store, and the car's low on gas.
And I told you boys to pick up your clothes and who left the wet towel on the bed?!
You know what?! That's what I'm going to do! I'm going to go on strike, and you can all try living without me! What do you think about that, huh?!
That's what I'm going to do! I'm going to do that! I'm going to go on strike!
I was breast-feeding Stewie and he bit me again. I think he might have even broken the skin.
You see, the areola is very tender here, and I think one of his new teeth may have bitten down right on the duct.
Uh... any, any other problems you have, too, like, for example, around your underpants... that you want me to take a look at, I could, I could take a look at that, too.
All right, boys, it's my maid's last night, so we got to make the most of it.
Now I know it's different than you're used to, but you'll see. It's just as good.
You know this place is unique because if you're lucky, some nights around sunset, the screaming black dolphins come out.
No, no, I know Quagmire and I'm telling you, this has got to be some kind of prank.
Of course it's clear. Every American has the right to hang a pair of bear arms on their wall. How could that possibly be misconstrued?
Wait. You know what? Before we send this to the printer, let's take that abortion thing out.
You all just take your shoes off, there. Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing.
Joan and I always say, if you don't have anything nice to say about someone don't say anything at all. We say that, right, honey?
These people have put an old-fashioned Colonial spinning wheel in the center of their living room.
I know you've got a foot fetish so I got you this Statue of Liberty's foot.
You think this is just: Oh, here comes Peter with the Statue of Liberty's foot? Oh, isn't that a gas? No, no. The reality, the real reality of getting this together was staggering.
I had to call in a whole bunch of favors from people I've never even met.
So the very least you can do is just rub up against... I don't know.
So, anyway, what I'm trying to tell you is, uh... some of the guys thought we should get a divorce.
'Cause if you ever left me, I'd have to cut myself. and then... I'd cut you.
Wait a second. We know she's gonna be upset if you dump her, but if something happened that was out of your control...
This may be the most absolutely perfect fake death in the history of fake deaths.
This is, uh, not going to be easy, but, um, it's something you should see.
So, anyway, here's Quagmire walking through the park minding his own business. I just happened to be there with my video camera, when a ninja shows up!
You go for a walk in the park one day and wheel chair ninjas and Nazis and pots-and-pans robots show up to kill you and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.
Well, Brian, I thought I was ready to wean him, but I just miss the bonding.
Well, Mayor West is afraid of zombies, so the city says all caskets must been cased in concrete.
Sorry, Mr. Quagmire, but I still need a body to take back with me, so...
Chris, I know when you're lying to me, just like Santa Claus knows when you're sleeping.
For my science homework, I had to make a shoebox diarrhea of the evolution of man.
I can use my helm of disintegration, and do One-D-Four damage as my half-elf mage wields his plus five holy avenger.
Although, I got to tell you, I was, uh, kind of getting used to the idea of having a little brother or sister.
First of all, I don't know what that is, and second of all, no freaking way.
Peter, it's the male equivalent of a woman getting her tube's tied, except it's actually a lot quicker and safer.
You know, the one who always has high beams under her ribbed white cotton T-shirt
And you couldn't help but notice that the female lawyer running the seminar had a huge rack
That's right. You take the venom out of a cobra, and what have you got?
A bunch of the guys on the force have had vasectomies, and their lives haven't changed at all.
Well, yeah, but what if me and Lois do end up wanting another baby? It'll be too late.
I don't know, Cleveland. It didn't work out so great that time I froze my nuts.
Yeah. Uh, I kind of, uh, warmed myself up in the car, if you catch my drift.
We'd like a vial of sperm and an applicator that looks like Jody Foster's knuckles.
And, uh, just so you know, everything in there is exactly the way it was when I went in.
There is absolutely zero chance that I spilled all the jars and had to refill them with my own sperm.
Ah, I just don't feel like it, Lois, seeing as how I'm not a real man anymore.
I got to go meet Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire down at the bar, so, uh, just put my dinner in the fridge, and I'll heat it up later.
Good God, running an empire is harder than finding diversity in the Abercrombie & Fitchcatalogue.
So be it. I'll do to you what B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis.
You know, at first, I didn't want to do it 'cause of the vasectomy, but now it's just...
You know, that little wrinkle that fat people get on their elbows that looks like a schwa?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I would do everything to her. I don't care what she looks like.
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're, like... it's better than yours, damn right, it's better than yours I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.
You start with five pounds, and then one day, boom, you wake up, and you're on The Practice with sixteen rings in your ear.
Now, if you'll excuse me i have to go warn the chef that you've arrived.
It's quite simple, actually. You press the smiling duck to take off, the cow with the bow tie to fire weapons, and the clown face is just a clown face, enjoy it.
We've got to fight him over there by the swing set, so we don't have to fight him here at the sandbox.
You'll probably just slice a couple of bananas in here and chow down, huh, porky?
He's got a clown costume in his trunk, so we know he's good with kids, and pictures of boys in their underwear, so he's probably had some medical training.
Well, I'm going to take off while he fits you for cups in that windowless supply shed.
Ever since I was a little boy, people have enjoyed the sound of my voice, and I figured you either get busy talkin' or you get busy dyin'.
Why, even right now, I'm just sitting in a chair sipping some tea and reading from a script.
The wall is covered with something that resembles egg crates, except they're soft and spongy, like a Twinkie... like a Twinkie.
Do me a favor when you go to sleep, aim your butt the other way.
There were so many boobs, I didn't know whose boobs I was grabbing, your boobs or my boobs.
Well, when I'm done with you, you're going to hate me more that the other vowels hate Y.
If you'll turn to page 34 of your blue books, you'll see our projections for next quarter,
This can be a pain in the ass when you got to do it all by yourself.
Oh, Lois, I have no idea if we're doing it of if that's just the back of your knee, but either way it feels so good.
Well, it was a tough job removing all that fat to get to your heart, Mrs Griffin, but you came through it beautifully.
Although, I gotta admit, I'm gonna miss eating cereal out of the dimples on your ass.
Well, Mrs. Griffin, you rest up for a few days and you'll be just fine.
I don't know what a Hollaback Girl is, all I know is I want her dead.
Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done. Ding, fries are done.
I mean, it's time I went out and got a job, for God's sakes, I'm seven years old.
I couldn't help but notice you across the parking lot and, uh... you know, you're very attractive and, uh...
You know what I would've done to you back there? Why didn't you say something earlier?
Yeah, but I got you good, Lois. Admit it. Just say it, I got you.
Let's see the gross half of your face so I can get out of here.
Well, Lois, I thought you and me could do a song for the talent show.
We want to talk to you about a friend of ours. He's not here tonight.
Uh, this is a song about that man and his world that was taken from him.
So if you see the Noid running around, tell him if he ruins my pizza's freshness,
You know, Meg, that guy's been playing fast and loose with his position for years now, and I've had it. He's a corrupt bastard.
I'm on my way to meet a source who won't talk to me over the phone.
Hey, now, Peter, you gotta remember that when we used to write the old songs, we had a lot of inspiration, huh?
You know, I think Brian may have some inspiration in a cigar box under his bed.
No, no, no, I actually came to my senses, and realized I was out of line. Uh, I'm just here to apologize.
Hey, can you guys hold on a sec? I gotta get this to Helen in Accounting.
All we need is one incriminating entry in this date book, and that's our ticket to...
Well, uh, you two are busy being nude. So, uh... we'll just, uh, head out and, uh... let you be nude.
Well, this is the last entry in the date book. Super secret meeting at motel. Inform no one.
In a moment, we will use the special lights to see just how filthy this seemingly clean hotel room really is.
We don't have to, Lois. Look... there's a magical land of desserts right behind you.
I am going to the press with this story, and when it hits, it'll be bigger than Uncle Sam's nipples.
I got so caught up in taking down Mayor West, that I just lost sight of right and wrong.
Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons, and I'd like to welcome you to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.
Uh, married a black fella, which is quite a surprise because I'd call her quite a catch, and black guys, by and large, they're not so helpful on a fishing vessel.
You guys were so baked, you didn't sound anywhere near as good as you thought you did.
Well, that's a popular misconception, Mom and Dad, but the fact is, the chief ingredient in marijuana is THC, a mild form of acid, prolonged usage of which can cause adverse effects to your sexual potency, short-term memory loss and can also severely damage your brain tissue central nervous system and basic motor skills.
To put it simply, Mom and Dad, there's a reason that they call it dope.
You know, when she tugged her ear at the end of that show, she was really saying good-night to her mom.
That's the first time I've seen you reading something that didn't later turn out to just be a sandwich.
I got to tell you, I've read 4 chapters of this, and it's not sexy at all. Much Ado About Humping.  Well, sounds sexy.
What the hell is that? That's not sexy. You can't do somebody in the shoulder.
Hey, guys, tell me if this letter sounds all right. Dear Reek Publishing, I was highly disappointed by your erotic novel. Here's what I would've wrote: It was past midnight when the blonde, smokin'- hot lab assistant who looked a little like Heather Locklear, only with bigger jugs, was grabbed and thrown on to the lab table. He ripped off her lab coat, and she grabbed his metallic extension. Oh, did I mention he was a robot? Cause that's kind of important. Yeah, a robot. Awesome.
I'm no school administrator, but there's an extension program going on in my trousers. And then Captain Leroy Hot Dog' Zanzibar and Gina from my work got in the backseat of his really cool spaceship. Gina was finally wearing that tank top I got her and nothing else. Zanzibar knew he couldn't control his space horniness any longer, and then they totally did it. And if I'd have been there, I would've been, like, Ah, sweet.
Hey, if you ask daddy, he might even give you some money to do it yourself.
If this works out, I could make more money than when I had that rat farm in the basement.
We are trying, Senor Griffin, but the land, she gives us nothing. There is no sunlight.
The spectators hold their breath as Stewie Griffin is America's last hope... to take home the gold.
Oh, my God, that was even cooler than playing with the speech function on my Macintosh.
Listen, uh, Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're a businessman, I'm a businessman, and I've got a proposal that I guarantee you can't refuse.
See, I wrote this erotica book, and I was hoping you could loan me $7 billion to publish it.
Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt gave me five dollars for these Xeroxes, and I haven't looked back.
Hi. Would you be offended if I told you your prose suggests a male-working class version of Emily Bronte?
Would you be offended if I said I'd like to use your ass as a bongo drum?
I'm Betty White reading The Hot Chick Who Was Italian, or Maybe Some Kind of Spanish, by Peter Griffin.
Chapter One. Oh, God, you should've seen this one hot chick. She was totally Italian. Or maybe some kind of Spanish.
Well, it's not real fur. It's actually made from bald eagle, and it's weather-treated with a mixture of whale skin oil and children's tears.
Well, Mr. Greenberg i'd like to see you try to cease my assets after battling the Rancor.
I lost my home, my money, and, perhaps just as serious, my wife left me!
And i'll be here to entertain you and love my life for many, many years to come.
All right, Cathy, it looks like Stewie Griffin is preparing to begin the floor routine.
Listen, I know you're upset about losing your money, so I wanted to show you it's not so bad living like a regular guy.
Trust me, it makes it that much more special when we finally get inside and see Renee Zellweger doing her whole scrunch-face routine.
The bus smells like crap, the movie theater is sticky, and Renee Zellweger should only be the cute friend at best.
You know, I never thought about it till now, but... maybe being a regular person does suck.
I just got a subpoena regarding an erotic novel, and I'm looking for the son of a bitch responsible.
All right, Peter, how are we going to do this? How are we going to get rich?
Hey, Meg, uh, we're trying to make some money and, um... would you like to buy some pot from your granddaddy and me?
All I know is, there's a lot of money to be made in these stupid teen dramas they keep putting on TV.
I don't want to do this anymore, all right? You know what? You went too far.
I got to pay for that. That comes out of my paycheck... if you take it.
Ten years ago Daddy offered to give us $10 million, and I turned it down.
Well, we do have... we got Total, and we got some raisins. I mean, you could, like, mix those together. It'd be... it'd be kinda like Raisin Bran.
No, no. No room at all. But, lucky for you, there's a big new airport out in the middle of the ocean.
Five hours on my moneymaker, sitting across from a gaggle of sailors flying home on leave, here I am in a committed relationship, and all I can think about is having a piece of Navy cake.
I can think of no greater tribute to their memories than this solid gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks frog.
The spirit of America is epitomized by his inspiring motto: Smack, smack, Sugar Smack. Gimme a smack, and I'll smack you back.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce extreme budget cutbacks having almost nothing to do with this solid-gold statue.
Oh, what's next? A workout followed by a romp around a crowded room while the music goes...
Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something. When you're in the shower at the Y, is that just like Supermarket Sweep for you guys, or is there some kind of etiquette?
Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't realized this is not how a human being is supposed to look.
And the speech thing, and what you're doing with your eye... uh, you had a stroke about seven years ago.
That you've managed to be walking around all this time is nothing short of a miracle.
Oh, you hear that, Meg? Guys can marry other guys now. So... um... this is awkward, but, uh... I mean, if they can do that, that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
Also, we perpetuate the ideal that Jesus chose America to destroy nonbelievers and brown people.
I'm here at the parking lot outside City Hall, where hundreds of citizens have come out in protest of the Mayor's decision to spend the town's treasury on a gold frog.
Well, it's encouraging to know that I'm not the only Mayor West who's facing difficulties.
Listen, Ricardo and I want to thank you for letting us have the wedding here.
I heard you and your little chew toy getting it on last night. Keep it down.
Sorry, little man. Ricardo and I were playing Clue, and he got me in the bedroom with a lead pipe.
If gays wanna get married and be miserable like the rest of us, I say we should let 'em.
Some breaking news today when Mayor West announced he will sign a citywide ban on gay marriages next week.
While controversial, it has nonetheless effectively distracted all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.
All I ever wanted was to get married and make a home with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy. Isn't that the American dream?
Mayor West only banned gay marriage so he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.
The Bible also says a senior citizen built an ark and rounded up two of every animal.
Chris, did you hear? Some dog is going around town trying to get support for gay marriage.
I'm a very open-minded person, and I've never had any problem with gays before, but something about two gay people getting married, I just don't think it's right.
You know, there's been a lot of talk lately about homosexuals, but how do you know what to believe?
Well, here are a few tips that may help you tell when you've got a gay.
If instead of human blood, you find a deadly corrosive acid, you've got a gay.
Well, they certainly have every right to be together, but marriage should be between a man and a woman.
Well, regardless of what you think, this is going to change Mayor West's mind, and we are going to have Jasper's wedding here.
I still kick myself for missing that Topless Cheerleader Parade with the hundred-foot chocolate teddy bear and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics choreographed to the music of Queen.
You idiot! Now I'm going to have to get 10,000 more signatures before tomorrow morning. What were you thinking?!
I'm going to sign it with all capital letters. it's going to say, ADAM WEST.
I've been up for 24 hours, I paid off a few people and I did a few things in West Quahog I'm not proud of.
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield the exact size of a bullet somewhere on my body. And if you hit it,
You can put an end to this right now by tearing up that gay marriage ban.
And now, some Channel 5 exclusive footage of the crazed homosexual gunman who's taken Mayor West hostage.
What if Brian's right? I mean, certainly the love between a man and a woman should be sacred, but...
So two straight people who hate each other have more of a right to be together than two gay people who love each other?
It's only a matter of time before Mayor West signs that bill, and you'll get to touch these.
Look, Peter, if you can't get Brian to come out peacefully, we're going to have to take him down.
I was wrong. If two people love each other, they should have the right to get married.
And, hey, you've distracted everyone from the Dig 'Em statue, so I guess we don't need this bill anymore.
I really appreciate you putting your discomfort aside, so we can have the wedding here.
I'm just here to let y'all know that movie night's been moved to Joe's place.
Well, tomorrow I'm going to that home supply and I'm going to build an entire multiplex.
Yeah, I hate my neighbor and I want to build something crazy out of spite.
I just bought a Rottweiler and I need a sign to warn people how dangerous it is.
So people will know if they step into my yard, there's only one way out... in a body bag... from dog injuries.
I can't wait to see the expression on Joe's legs when I open my multiplex.
No, Lois, I'm getting up and walking all the way to the bathroom and doing it there.
The only time of the day I get to try out my Fred Schneider B-52s voice.
No, they did a spin-off. He's still playing Joey, but... eh, it's not doing so well.
Uh, Lois, have you, uh, noticed some spooky things going on ever since Peter brought that skull into the house?
Oh, I must have accidentally stacked all those things upside down and then just forgot about it. Yeah, that's probably what happened.
Hey, I'm Stewie Griffin, and I'm going to be kicking my dad's ass all day today.
We've never hired a spiritual medium before, but I'll do anything to get my baby back.
You know, Peter, we wouldn't have to be messing around with ghosts if you hadn't desecrated those Indian remains.
Well, how about you and my father go and hang out at the gun range some afternoon and you can spend the whole day just agreeing with each other.
They said that your baby had entered their world through the closet upstairs and that the exit is...
Well, I don't know how else to say this, but... the exit is your daughter's bum.
Okay, Meg, if this works, then we might just have a chance at getting Stewie back.
We just got to be patient, Lois, like waiting on the results of a blood test, a real important blood test.
They're walking along, they stop and say, Ooh, is that a new restaurant? That place must've just opened up.
I went in there once and there was a guy with a harelip eating soup, and I was like, Ew... '
I mean, I guess there's only, like, a one in 50 chance of me getting the same spoon that he had, but I still don't like them odds.
If Stewie can't find his way out of Meg's ass, we have to enter the other realm and get him ourselves.
A bit of breaking news. A local family is forced out of their home by ghosts.
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts, and now our house is gone and we got no place to stay.
It's an avocado pit with a little bit of avocado still on it, and that comes on a ripped pair of boxer shorts.
Now, I'm trying to decide between the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper and the half yogurt with the balled-up tissue in it.
All right, here it is. To vanquish poltergeists, one must restore all disturbed remains to their original resting places.
So, all we got to do is bring the skull back home and bury it.
Except for that one show he did in Ohio after the airline lost his luggage.
I normally have, like, a case with all my... little props and gadgets and what not, but... it's okay, you can use your imagination, like maybe a piece of luggage, that shoots dog biscuits, so, like, if you had, like, weed in your bag and you went to the airport, you could shoot the dog biscuits out, and then, the drug dog would be... would go away from your bags, kind of... if you can imagine the dog... the dog...
Oh, that's funny, he came up with the same thing that... All right, Carrot Top!
Very well, Mr. Griffin, I'll give you the skull, but you have to catch me first!
But which one of us is the real king of prop comedy and not just an illusion, huh?
Once again, you brought our family to the edge of the abyss, and at the very last minute, you saved us all.
Well, I got the idea to build a panic room after I saw that movie The Butterfly Effect.
But I think it's important for the last one of us left alive to know this story.
Of course, I'm obligated by the State of Kansas to present the church's alternative to the theory of evolution.
After that, a meteor hit the Earth turning it into a block of ice for some reason, but then it thawed and cavemen came.
There have been many great Griffins through out history, including Moses Griffin who led the Jews out of Egypt.
All right, it's going to be a long journey everyone, but I will lead you to freedom.
Commandment number four: When we pass a billboard, please don't read it out loud.  All right? Now, come on, let's get going.
It all began in Africa in the tiny village of Quahog-swana where he was a proud member of the tribe of Tootie-an-Blair.
Oh, it was awesome. You never feel as big as you do with a pygmy.
Not today, Joemama. I'm going off to find a log to build a drum so I can play the opening part from Hot For Teacher.
Coming up in this half hour, flies on your face how many is too many?
But first, that orange thing in the sky and what you can do to please it.
If we can break out of here, I've got an idea how to give the captain of this boat what he deserves.
It was way down there. You know, when you stop seeing Howard Johnson's and you start seeing Stuckey's. Anyway, it was a horrible place where they took away everybody's African names and gave them new names.
With an accent over the I, and a little lineover the O so you know it's a long vowel sound and not a short one.
And sometimes I like to dot the I with a little smiley face or a heart or something.
Of course, back then the South was a very different place than it is today.
A backward place where they didn't believe in science and hated others just for being different.
The quarters are too crowded, the hours are long and... you know, I don't like to be this guy, but... a couple of the overseers have been making racial slurs.
Of course, ordinarily black guys aren't attracted to white women, but she was something different.
As a poet might say, she was the kind of woman you just want to have sex with over and over.
With the kind of breasts you just want to push together so she looks like a cross-eyed torso.
And, from the moment that piece of off-color blue comedy was uttered, their lives were changed forever.
Luckily, they were helped by Nate's good friend, Al Cowlings, who showed up on his trusty white bronco.
That's right, Diane. We're looking at Nate Griffin and Al Cowlings the man we believe to be Al Cowlings. We'll stay with the chase.
At some point, that horse is going to have to stop and eat some grain.
After that, Nate devoted his life to getting back at the white man for the injustice of slavery, by inventing the Department of Motor Vehicles.
If we angle it through the vent, we might be able to alert the authorities.
That was a tank of Tony Danza's breath. I wonder who got my oxygen tank.
I might as well tell you about my great grandfather, who was the greatest silent movie star of the '20s.
They spent their idle time cavorting, doing the Charleston and enjoying America's prosperity following World War I, which, at that time, was called International Civil War II.
So, is, uh... is this, like, the part where you guys have your way with me?
Well, it sure would suck if you guys died without hearing the story of my great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was Adolf's favorite brother.
Hey, you ready to go check out that new skin flick over at the booben garden?
All of Europe will tremble as Germany take sits rightful place as ruler of the world!
You know what? You guys, with your marching and your letters and your phone calls, this is all thanks to you. You made this happen, you guys... My God! Give yourselves a round of applause! Come on.
But, since we're all gonna die, there's one more secret I feel I have to share with you:
It takes forever getting in, and then you spend, like six and half hours, and then,
How can you say you don't like it if you haven't even given it a chance?
I get to the scene where all the guys are sitting around on easy chairs...
Like they're speaking a different language. That's why I lose interest and I go away.
Quahog is seeing its worst flu epidemic in years, due in part to a severe shortage of flu shots.
Oh, well, since it's already in there, you might as well, push down on the ol' plunger there.
Well, you're 42 years old and it says here you've never had a prostate exam.
All right, Mr. Griffin, I'm just going to need you to drop your pants and we'll check your prostate.
Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring? Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?
Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged according to size from largest to smallest, and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.
I only went in there for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval, but I turned out to be the guinea pig, for a sexual experimentation.
Oh, God, it was horrible! I scrubbed and I scrubbed, but damn it, they don't make water hot enough!
Well, why shouldn't I be? You saved Rupert's life and I love you for it.
You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at the mall who says he'll take any case,
You know, it's just I'm tired of you hitting on her. That's all, it's-it's not cool.
Our top story : a local woman loses her sex drive after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.
But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman, beloved family doctor to all of Quahog, is the target of a molestation lawsuit.
Stewie used to be so independent, but now he just clings to me night and day. I'm exhausted.
And I suppose it wouldn't matter if I told you for the 50th time that it's a legitimate medical procedure to test for cancer.
Is it not true that you went to see Dr. Hartman for a simple prostate exam?
I tried to get him to stop, but he kept saying, Relax, I'm a doctor.
Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy and black and white? Think about it.
Okay, everybody, uh, I know you were expecting something else, but as science will tell you, people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.
Okay, so if we can all be mature... give me the gum, we can all get through this a lot faster.
I have so much fun when we hang out, Lois, and I love your hair.
We could call it, like, like, strawberry sunset or ginger maiden, o-o-or-or one of those hair color names that's a random noun, like like temptress.
I'm like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage by holding him underwater. I'm just like Barbara Bush!
Brian, what kind of a mother has homicidal thoughts about her own baby? I'm a horrible person.
I tell you, boys, this is a victory not just for my anus but for anuses...
That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a... Oh, I got to take a leak.
If it's gale-force peeing you be doing, it could mean you've got barnacles on your prostate.
Aye, and soon, before your rudder jams with flotsam and you're dropping anchor without an order from the captain.
Listen, uh, I know I'm not a regular patient, but I think I have some trouble with my prostate.
He's just being melodramatic. You've got to ignore it if you really want to help him.
I mean, I have, uh, sort of been hitting the gym, so uh, if-if you wanted to see how it's going...
Dr. Hartman is my only hope, and there's no way he's going to see me.
Never know when it's going to come up in conversation and then, who's the one who's prepared?
I've also got a map of Middle Earth, a cat doing a pull-up, and the guys from Primus.
I ate this whole jar of pills that look like candy and now I feel sick.
Never again, Stewie. I'm going to give you all the love you could ever want.
Uh, so why don't you go ahead and open it up and reach on in there?
Look, I-I know what I did was wrong, but you're the only one I can turn to.
So, I'm asking you... as a man with no more options... will you take a look in my ass?
Ladies and gentlemen, keep your eye on the sky for the aerial acrobatics of Captain Glen Quagmire.
Okay, and, um, number three could you say, Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives.
And if you think you can say that just like Weenie here, you could win 97.1 dollars for the cool weekend ahead.
Peter and Lois leave the radio on when they go out so I feel like somebody's home.
And now back to Round Table, with Al Michaels, Harold Ramis, Ray Romano, and Kermit the Frog.
I never see you, and then you finally come visit me and you drop a bombshell like this?
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin, and you're listening to The Lunch Hour, serving up food for the mind.
Um, yes, that turkey, that- that raw turkey that you ate off the counter last week that got Lois mad, when you pooped that out was the timer still in there?
I was on my way in here to cancel your show, but the banter you did with that guy, well, as we say in the radio business, If you put that on the radio, people will listen to it!
In my view, as good as the Yankees were in the first half of this game, that's how as bad they've been now.
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker trying to get back on my feet after having my ass handed to me by my bitch of an ex-wife.
I don't see the problem, either, but let's go to Ollie Williams for the inepth analysis. Ollie?
The only reason you're here is that my boss ordered me to bring you on.
All right, this is my show, and it's a serious, intellectual hour of discussion and I want to keep it that way.
Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment for you, but all I want is for your mom to be happy.
Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do my best to make her even happier than those kids on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.
All right, I'll take that, and I'm gonna hurry home and show it to Lois.
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that, and I'll-I'll meet you up there in like five minutes.
Tom, there's no easy way to say this, I'll just come right out with it.
How about the first three women willing to come down and have sex with Hank get free boob jobs courtesy of Dr. John Viener?
Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like to come down here and get naked for us?
But no matter how you come to judge, Charles Wheeler and his partners' unethical, moral, and inhuman terms, the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.
Uh... if you put that ice cream in your mouth you're gonna be in big trouble, young man!
We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon, and for every hot dog that you catch in your mouth, you get a $100 toward a boob job that you desperately need.
I think the Kennedys had a kid like you, and they had it put to sleep.
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like to have a real father.
Huh, I guess I've learned a little something about what it means to be a good dad.
Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you to pick up Meg at the roller rink.
Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk?
You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on, you got to get your car home.
Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus?
And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official.
Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs up against glass in public just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill!
Remember when you hit that pedestrian with your car at the crosswalk  and then just drove away?
But Pepperidge Farm ain't just gonna keep it to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge.
Maybe you go outand buy yourself some of these distinctive Milano cookies, maybe this whole thing just disappears.
What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months, but she gets a freakin' car just like that?!
Dude, those animals are so fucking funny, they make me want to merge without looking!
Oh, that's just an old tank I use for those commercials where I declare war on high prices.
We come in here wanting a practical car, but then you dangle this tank in front of me and expect me to walk away.
Now, I may be an idiot, but there is one thing I am not, sir, and that, sir, is an idiot.
My money paid for that tank, and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.
I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson confiscate the closest thing I had to a car.
Yeah, right. You hate all megastores, ever since you were petted way too hard by that special boy in front of Kmart.
You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime, no health benefits, and every day at 3:00, you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.
In fact, the only guy in town making any money is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.
Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing what I've been trying to explain to you.
That mega store is a big, evil corporation that means nothing but trouble for this town.
Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.
Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site and can sell beer at a much cheaper price.
At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering it's worst heat wave in a century.
In other news, Quahog will be experiencing rolling blackouts to help meet Superstore USA's extensive power demands.
Contrary to those upbeat lyrics, the Electric Company would like us to emphasize it will not be bringing you the power.
You know, instead of sitting around complaining, why don't we go down there and protest?
Well, fine, then I guess I got to go in there and drag 'em out one by one.
When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation... that I'm standing on a mountain top with the wind blowing through my hair.
What would a guy like me have to do to be part of this magical world?
Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better at this job than I did on the SAT's.
I know I'm not supposed to go outside the lines, but I do anyway because I like being myself.
I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA, while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat.
Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this, but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable of performing the simplest tasks.
Take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and before you know it, you'll be up on your roof; pooping in the chimney.
You get to save money for college, there's free food, and all the brown people you can rape.
Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent of our high school class is off to fight another battle.
Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've got some sharp cookies over at the, uh...
Coming this fall, if you loved Everybody Loves Raymond, then you'll love his brother, Robert, even more, in Robert.
I bet you she made a sandwich that wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway.
Don't worry, Lois, all he needs is an after-school activity to get his mind off the army. Just something to distract him.
I just want to swing by the army recruiting center and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.
Yes, you'll be about as effective as the Wizard of Oz was at granting wishes.
And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes, but little did you know, you've had herpes all along.
Well, actually, yeah, your last little, uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie, that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny.
And we are gonna rock this place until... un... well, until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over!
You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack, or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their toothbrushes.
Private Griffin, just for that, you have to listen to one track from this Chris Gaines album.
Huh. Should I follow the knight into the dungeon or should I go back the way I came?
Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came. I didn't take my hand off the page.
You know, I'm glad Chris found an activity he likes, but why do they have to use our garage?
Let me ask you this : when was the last time you saw something through to the end?
Chris, will you knock that off for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you.
Ever since you hooked up with this band, you're like a completely different person, and I don't like it one bit.
He's acting worse than you did when you tried to cover your farts by coughing.
But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate, or none of you graduate. Griffin, it's up to you.
Oh, I say, this is an even bigger accomplishment than getting Minnie Driver's head to fit on screen.
I'm sure you'll do your country proud tomorrow morning, when you're all shipped off to Iraq.
Okay, right, so I throw backpack, come back and have big hero party with many virgins.
Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah, Charlie, Tango, Cash, uh, 47, Victor, Charlie, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!
Listen to these lyrics. I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches. I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits.
Oh, look, they've got a translation for white people : I give 110 percent when it comes to helping my community, even though I occasionally associate with some less than reputable characters.
You're right, we got to find this Marilyn Manson and I got to give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis.
Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain right now, the two of us.
Uh, we both got shot in the foot, so, uh, we figured an honorable discharge would be in order and, uh, you could just send us back to the States.
There was only one man in the world with the vision to predict something like this.
And I just wanted to tell you, rock n' roll music is cool, but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to.
And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen is with a healthy breakfast rich in breads and grains.
They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal.
We have to hurry! I learned in Biology if you get them back soon enough, they can be reattached.
Maybe if we make it mad, it'll come down here and we can catch it and get the finger.
Look, Brian, I think it's wonderful you've found a young lady willing to stoop to your level.
Oh, boy, I tell you, I haven't felt this good since I came up with that new place to hide my porn.
They had one on last night where the girl had a buttface but her breasts was immaculate.
Besides, it sure beats the hell out of last Saturday when we partied with that big-horned guy from Legend.
Is that the one where there's a guy and he's like, uh, he's a pilot or something?
No, no, it took place in an airport. Th-Th-The thing was on for ten years.
But a moron with large breasts you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars, or whatever it is grown-ups do with large breasts.
I know Brian's work has him coming and going at all hours of the night.
Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning, I call my friend Cleveland and he describes every scene from You, Me, and Dupree.
I need to see some improvement by the end of the week or you're finished.
Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in and helping me get my work done.
Hey, you know, uh, with you sitting there, it's, uh, it's kind of like you're my secretary.
Lois, take a letter. Dear Life Cereal, Where do you get off? Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious? Who do you think you are? By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically and have nothing but good things to say about what you do. Life Cereal, do not change a thing. Signed, Peter Griffin. Dictated but not read.
You know, think what you want, but you don't see the side of Jillian that I do.
For your information, Jillian is very bright and she happens to be a very talented photographer.
Ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On. You must be so brooding and deep.
Uh, a lot of things. Um... food, um... the new seat covers she just got for her Jetta.
But just tell me this, Brian : does she laugh on her own or does she laugh only when you laugh?
Uh, so, yeah, um... so I figured we could get together tonight and maybe, um, do all those things sexually that we usually do.
I think it would be so hot for you and me to have sex in my office.
You know, it's no wonder you're so far behind in your work if this is how you behave at the office.
Geez, Lois, I thought having you here was gonna be fun, but so far you're a bigger buzzkill than Buzz Killington.
I thought it would be very droll if we all sat down and looked at etchings.
And then, think about this : have you ever seen the sun and the moon in the same place at the same time?
Well, hey, what are the odds of finding true love anywhere in the world says this observer.
I threw up a lot in high school, so I don't get my period anymore.
Well, I just think, for starters, that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us and, truthishly, we should just accept that.
So then the valet pulls up and I'm all, That is so not my car.
Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to Penthouse Forum, and I don't wanna be made a liar in the nudie magazine of record.
Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week, and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office.
Because once it's done, never again will you have to listen to her talk like this?
Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your maker at the hands of my cat launcher.
The kid in me likes the frosted side... but the grown-up in me likes the kid in me.
Tomorrow, I'm going down to James Woods High and offer to teach the class myself.
'cause that makes it more likely that one of those kids'll grow up and make it big in Hollywood.
Lois, you think I'm going to miss a chance to share my knowledge with these fresh young minds?
I am all done writing plays for the day, perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?
If you put that under your pillow, the Tooth Fairy will come and give you a dollar.
Yeah, she creeps into your house at night and comes into your room while you sleep.
And sometimes, just for the hell of it, she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair and places it gently on your tongue.
Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here!
Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's.
Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me again.
Fine, but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson when he tries to play an American cowboy.
Gonna take a fortnight at least to get this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class.
Well, Lois, I think you did the right thing by trying to inform these kids about safe sex.
All right, students, we have a special speaker today who's going to educate you about sex.
Please welcome from the First Evangelical Church, the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood and the Opal Ring Crusade.
Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it before you're married, even if you use a condom.
These rings are a symbol of your commitment to refrain from sex until you're married.
Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up, but, watch carefully. If I move this down here, and this over here, and this part here...
All right, men, your mission tonight is to stave off the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be a while before you lose another tooth.
If you want Brian to say : Arriba! and dance around a sombrero, text FAMGUY3.
Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring. It means I made a pledge not to have sex.
Dad, look at the facts about sex. If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension populated entirely by dogs who will eat it.
All right, getting a tooth to lure that damn fairy back shouldn't be too difficult.
I know, I feel the same way, but we made a decision to be abstinent.
Of course, there are ways we could keep our pledge and still do other things.
Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent, but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count.
Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.
Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade, and this is how we choose to express our love.
Look, Meg, A) ear sex is just unnatural, and B)... How do I say this?
I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose?
That's right, Tom. It appears that students have taken to having ear sex in lieu of traditional intercourse.
Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far, prompting a new slogan : Once you go black, you go deaf.
Excellent. Now I'm prepared to fight the Tooth Fairy just like Gerri fought comedy on The Facts of Life.
I am going to have regular sex with you whether you like it or not.
Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but, yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors just like Harry Houdini.
And if you do make the choice to act on them, make sure you protect yourselves, use a condom.
But first, the big news in entertainment this week is the lovable child actress,  Olivia Fuller.
Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.
No, but you can have some Tasty Juice. It has only one-third the sugar of soda.
But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins with today's announcement that Tasty Juice will be dropping her as their spokesperson and replacing her with a new ad campaign featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians, as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh.
Lois, I'm just warning you, if this movie turns me gay, I'm going to start bringing gay guys home.
I mean those big, Oh, my God, here they come, floatin' around, making noise gay guys, not the fix up your house gay guys.
Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over on Friday, it's my Bernie Mac night.
I can't understand what the devil he's saying, but you know, there's a lot of movement, and it's bright and colorful, it keeps my attention.
Look, Stewie, you're sweet, but since I moved to Hollywood, I've done a lot of growing up.
Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face. I mean, she's a woman now, Brian. So sophisticated, so grown up, and she says she wants a grown-up man. But...
Hi, I'm the Mayor of Comedy here to tell you about a new CD offer :
She says she wants a more mature, grown-up man, so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.
I don't want my neighbors seeing a fat, old, dirty whore screaming at me on my front lawn.
Well, I don't know if you want to be that black and white about it.
No. If I was being mean, when you opened the door I would have said, Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia.
You see, I thought you were Ray Liotta because your skin has the texture of a decorative autumn squash.
I know. I love coming here because you can just sit here and people-watch, you know?
Just standing there smelling his hand? What is that? What is that on my hand? Is that... is that barbecue sauce? When was I near barbecue sauce?
I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be than right here right now with you.
It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz, is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has uncurable chick cancer.
Okay, now give him some peanut butter so we can make it look like he's talking.
Oh, hang on a sec. Uh, idea for a short story : guy picks his nose, then eats it.
Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia, why don't you and I go get some punch?
Oh, actually, would you mind getting some for Victor and me while we catch up?
Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor and go get the punch?
Uh, sure. Idea for a novel : guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.
Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming out.
Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh... it's been a long one.
If you're gonna leave all those lights on, I'm not gonna split the electric bill.
Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip, but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel, so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.
Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took all my money out of both our wallets.
That's what it all comes down to, isn't it? I'm not grown up enough for you.
Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby.
At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns, but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff, and before I knew Vageena Hertz.
When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to learn.
But one day, Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a sandwich... and this happened.
Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.
I mean, what kind of a man would I be If I ran off now?
Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know?
Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that?
The only way they're not going to kill my sister is if we give them the stone.
Joan Wilder's sister is being held hostage in Cartagena, and there's not a policeman in sight. I guess it's up to me.
Our top story : Mayor West has dispatched the entire Quahog police force to Cartagena, Columbia, to assist in the rescue of fictional 1984 movie character,
Lois, can you run inside and get me some oranges or whatever it is these things eat?
What with Mayor West sending all the cops away, everybody can do whatever they want.
Um, I heard you didn't have a date to the dance, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me.
All right, all right, Meg, look, what if I... what if I drove you and walked in with you
I have to buy a new dress. All the ones I have make me look fat.
The story on everyone's mind continues to be the absence of police officers in Quahog.
The only reason I didn't have to go myself is that South America isn't wheelchair accessible.
Well, we have started an emergency training program at the Police Academy, but I'm not sure that you're cut out for the job.
Excuse the hell out of me for trying to brighten your day with music, all right?
You know, the best thing about these girls is, even if you're terrible, they don't know the difference.
You know, Meg, there's no dogs allowed here, so you're going to have to leave. But Brian can stay.
You know, Connie, I think I have a theory about why you're such a bitch.
You see, Connie, you're popular because you developed early and started putting out when you were 12.
But now you can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror because all you see is a whore.
So, you pick on Meg to avoid the inevitable realization that once your body's used up by age 19, you're going to be a worn-out, chalky-skinned burlap sack that even your step dad won't want. How's that? Am I in the ballpark?
Now we can do this one of two ways. I can bust your balls to pieces right now, or we can spread it out over the course of the day.
With a little encouragement, you might get her to put her cankles behind her ears.
Look, it's not that big a deal, all right? We just... we just... made out a little.
It didn't mean anything. I had a few too many and... it's not even worth going into.
This is even a bigger jackpot than when the Emperor figured out the formula for great Star Wars dialogue.
Peter, you will be the police officer and Quagmire, you will be the suspect. Begin.
Sir, I suspect you are in possession of drugs, and I'm going to have to give you a full cavity search. Drop your pants.
You know, I thought about how you stood up for me at the dance, and all the nice things you said.
I saw this penis on the Internet today and I thought to myself : Well, that's...
I don't think that's gonna be a possibility. I have... plans, um... with Chris. Chris and I have plans this afternoon.
Well, maybe back to back, but I gotta tell you I'm not 100% on this.
Hi, Mom. Is it cool if Brian and I go to the mall this afternoon?
Right, Meg? Come on. Let's go to the mall. We'll get ya... get ya a big ol' pretzel.
Look, this has gone a little too far. I like you. I think you're great, but what happened at the dance was...
Meg, the fact is that you and I are friends, and that's the way it needs to stay.
Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all right about out little talk the other day.
Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. And... hey, look, I wanted to thank you for being so great to me.
Yeah, well, the thing is, Meg is becoming a little enamored with me, and I'm kind of losing control of the situation.
Look, the short version is, this morning, she made me eat the hair in her pie.
I don't know what the hell happened between you two, but you'd better go upstairs and straighten it out right now.
Joe, I gotta tell you, this whole cop thing ain't as exciting as I thought it was gonna be.
I like to watch her strip and pretend she's a woman who I've never met, but who looks just like Bonnie and lives in my house.
Mom, is it bad if I saw Meg tie up Brian last night, put him in the trunk of his car and then drive away?
Don't worry, Lois, we're the police, and we'll do our very best to find Brian and girl Chris.
Yeah, Brian, you're doing the same thing that Mia Farrow did to that Oriental guy that Woody Allen brought home from the circus.
Peter, hold on to that thought, because I'm going to explain to you when we get home all the things that are wrong with that statement.
Meg, I've watched you grow up from a playful little girl into a very special young woman.
Now you probably just think of me as square old Mr. Quagmire from next door, but I've been around the block a few times, learned a couple things, and I can tell you this, there's no reason to grow up too fast.
I can see why a relationship looks glamorous, but you've got all the time in the world and a lot of wonderful experiences ahead of ya.
Coming up at 11:00, Quahog police return to active duty after giving up the search for fictitious Romancing The Stone character
Plus, in national news, America's scoutmasters are asking : Why are the kids so shy in the shower?
Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human.
Lois, I don't come down to Burger King and tell you how to do your job.
We got reckless driving, disturbing the peace, plus the driver of one of the other cars was a virgin whose hymen was busted by the airbag, so rape.
Well, this is your own fault, Peter, and if you want my opinion, a little time away from the bar will do you some good.
Ah, man, now I can't even watch TV. What the hell am I gonna do all day?
Now come on, this is all time we could be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.
One minute I'm filling up at Chevron, and the next I'm having sex with Sharon Stone.
All right, all right! Geez, Lois, I'm just trying to amuse myself, since I don't have a damn driver's license.
Well, it was either Meg or a talking monkey smoking a cigar, but I didn't you'd like that.
For the rest of my life, I'll be as lonely as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell after the rapture.
Look, Stewie, don't you think, at some point, you're gonna have to let Rupert go?
Fine, then, I'll go by myself. See you from the back of my milk carton.
Yeah, well, when greyhounds start running The New York Times and the World Bank, I'll be more inclined to believe you.
Thanks for the ride, Bandit. Good luck tapping some of that hot, hot Sally Field tail.
All in pursuit of the ideal that no man should be subjugated because of the color of his skin.
I would say that, given the events that preceded it, the couple hundred years or so, maybe we're about even.
If we wanna get to Aspen, we're gonna have to get over those mountains somehow.
Aw, you should've seen what our amazing, freakin' daughter did to that guy, Lois. She kicked his ass.
Are you kidding, Meg? I've had more fun with you than I did going to see Lost in Translation with Cleveland and Quagmire.
You know, calling you names, reading your diary, farting in your cereal when you go to get milk and then laughing : Ha-ha ha! She doesn't know she's eating my fart.
You know, peer pressure and all that. But from now on, Meg, you and me are secret best friends.
Get out of the fucking car! Get out of the fucking car right now, man!
This is gonna be worse than that time I was stuck behind Robert Loggia at the airport.
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia. R as in Robert Loggia, O as in Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia, B as in By God, that's Robert Loggia, E as in everybody loves Robert Loggia, R as in Robert Loggia, T as in Tim, look over there, it's Robert Loggia, space, L as in Look, it's Robert Loggia...
Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake, and the guy wants to know how old Meg is. I didn't know what to tell him.
You know, we're gonna have to talk to her and kind of steer the conversation in a way that gets her to spill it.
Then he's walking home and along the way, he notices a grasshopper on the ground.
So he says to the grasshopper : Hey, you know there's a drink named after you?
I'm an adorable tramp who wears found clothing and eats out of your garbage can.
Dad, I'm so sorry I broke all your ribs and busted your spleen and punctured your lung.
Well, I hate to side with your father, Peter, but you do kind of drink a lot, and, you know, sometimes it affects the people you love.
You need to get to the heart of why you feel the need to drink in the first place.
Oh, what's this? Hot Monogamy, the board game for failing marriages. Dare card : Have her do a strip tease and see how long it takes you to get a bonner.
Lois came at me like a wild animal. I had no way to defend myself.
Oh, it was awful, Rupert. I felt terrified and brutalized and humiliated and... and... and alive.
Come on, Lois, hit me! Beat the crap out of me! Step on my cubes.
No, I sold it for crack. But listen, Mom, I've got to ask you something.
About 40 years ago, I was vactioning in Ireland, and I met a young rogue named Mickey McFinnegan.
All I know is somewhere in the great land of Ireland, is a big fat bastard who looks like me.
Call me as soon as you can, Peter. And I really hope you find your real father.
If I can just get her to hit me one more time, it'll give me the rush I've been looking for!
What's next? What's next? Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty, and I need to be taught a lesson and you're the one to do it.
Well, you know what'll ease your stress? Slap me across the face like a bitch!
Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my eye, violating me with a wine bottle.
Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the hills are green, the streams are clear, and the sweaters are so thick, even the boniest-fingered nun could poke you in the chest and it wouldn't bother you none.
I don't know exactly where the county Cork is but I know where it should be!
Oh, no, I don't want money. I just want to get to know you and be friends.
Who's leg do you have to hump to get a pint of Guiness around here?
Boy it's amazing, isn't it? You get two fathers and neither one of them wants anything to do with you.
There's got to be some way I can make him see that I'm worthy of being his son.
About the only way I can ever impress him is if I was a fat stinkin' drunk.
Wait a minute, Brian, that's it! I'm a fat stinkin' drunk because my father is a fat stinkin' drunk. I gotta prove it to him.
I have gotta drink him so far under the table, he'll have no choice but to respect me. Get me a beer, Brian.
And what makes you think you can hold your own with the *likes* of me?
Francis may not have been your father, but he raised you as if you were his own. And if that isn't love,
Hey, do you think it's time to talk to Quagmire about his anger issues with this game?
Listen, I think you're a real nice guy, but I've just decided to go with another paper.
Thank you. Would you like to come inside for a cupcake and a glass of wine?
Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate yourself to the back of the line with your feet and stand there with your shirt?
Well, Lois, you tied my golf shoes a little tight before I left the house.
Chris, what do you need money for? Isn't that why you have a paper route?
Oh, that's terrible. You're a wonderful paperboy, Chris, and you need to remind your customers of that.
Legs probably spread a little wider than they ought to be, but who gives a damn? This is just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.
Peter, I think one of us should go over and have a talk with Kyle's parents.
I'll do it, Lois. Right after a healthy breakfast of juice, toast and store brand imitation frosted flakes featuring Terry the Tiger.
The kind of mustache that says, Yeah, I've been nude on camera. What of it?
Oh, just a few friends over to enjoy this gorgeous weather, and maybe take a dip in the pool. Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.
Listen, I just want you to know what you did the other day was wrong.
Might be some problems later, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Uh, hey, buddy. I was just coming to tell ya it's time to get out.
I've been in there for six and a half hours, you son of a bitch!
Now why don't you patch things up with Mr. Griffin by showing him your Legos?
And the sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.
You know, I always used to be the nerd getting bullied, but doing it to someone else was pretty sweet.
Of course, your sunburn was pretty bad. I suppose it could be... the C word.
Well, the mole looks benign, but we won't know for sure whether it's cancerous until the tests come back in a few days.
Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy. They will do what you want because they know, they know what you want.
Brian, I may only have one week to live and I've got to make the most of it.
Now, I've made a list of things I want to do before I die and you've got to help me since this is all your fault. Visit Chicago Museum of Art.
I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision, but when I try to look at you, you scurry away.
Why only when I ignore you do you return to the center of my eye?
I thought it'd feel good to be a bully, but all I did was make people feel as bad as Randy made me feel.
I mean, you know, unless I get really stinkin' drunk, in which case all you got to do is outrun your sister.
You know you're a redneck if you come from a rural area and behave as such.
This is going to be more painful to watch than when he ate half a Fudgesicle in one bite.
Meg, I'm a redneck, which means I am about to do something to you that you will not remember until you're 40.
My Pet Goat. Page one. You know, said my pet goat, I'm sure, if I watched Grey's Anatomy, I'd like it, but I just don't have the time. You should make the time, said the farmer.
Our top story : There was drama in the skies of Quahog today, as a Trans National 767 was forced to make a crash-landing.
That's right, Diane. As if the world weren't already scary enough, it seems you can't even get on a plane safely these days.
However, using state-of-the-art Channel 5 computer technology, we'll show you how disastrous it could have been.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies but one passenger had survived, gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.
No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to siphon jet fuel from an active runway with the intention of flying a pickup truck.
Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble, but my redneck days are over.
Oh, great. This is gonna be worse than the time I lived with Marlee Matlin.
Oh, come on, Marlee, I know you can't hear them, but you got to feel those things slapping out of there!
Listen, I really want to thank you guys for taking me in in my time of need.
He's been living with us for over a month, and I think it's enough now.
Besides, I can't throw my best friend out on the street like a prom night Dumpster baby.
Well, you're gonna have to help him find one, because I've had enough of him living in this house.
Hey, uh, just an FYI, really no reason to go into any greater detail than this.
Then Joe and I will sneak into the flight attendants' lounge while Cleveland distracts the security personnel.
At which point, Quagmire is forced to step in and land the plane safely, making him a hero.
I could have sex with you or I could just stand over there and drink from the lake.
Hang on to something, 'cause this ride's about to get rougher than dating a hot girl with a bad laugh.
Ma'am, I hate to be a nuisance, but your son stopped kicking the back of my chair.
I know you have a choice in airport sex, and I appreciate your choosing Quagmire.
Please exercise caution when standing up, as the contents of your panties may have shifted during coitus.
More trouble in the skies over Quahog tonight, as a Trans National jet is apparently out of control.
He said : You know, I've got a 13-inch member... and Glenn Quagmire is the best damn pilot I've ever seen.
You bet he did... right before he died a very painful, AIDS-related death from having unprotected sex with so many people.
Now I want you to listen very carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
Take a firm hold of the throttle, and pull the red mixture knob out slowly.
All right, now do you see a button that looks like a drunken gay guy eyeing you from across the bar?
Coming up : Why calling every Asian man you meet Chung King can land an anchorman in hot water. After this.
I don't even mind that I was raped in a federal prison after I was arrested for hijacking.
I don't like the kids being around that racist sunflower that's growing in our yard.
I should be more reluctant to take my clothes off, but I'm not because my stepfather had boundary issues.
In other news, former president Bill Clinton was in town today to judge Quahog's annual Miss Cankle USA contest.
We'll start off your workout with vigorous calisthenics executed in rhythmic time with acetate pressings of the new musical craze called jazz.
Look, Lois told me I had to start using the toilet and you're the one who's had potty training, so
I'm just writing a letter to my boyfriend. Dear, my boyfriend, Thank you for making out with me recently on purpose. That was cool. Those flowers that you totally sent me were really pretty, just like you said I am. Love, Meg.
Meg, you are so full of crap. You're like those people who sit in Starbucks and publicly write on their laptops.
I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger without the fruity accent and the Pirates of the Caribbean wife.
It's just that I'm starting to realize I'm not as young as I used to be.
When you get out of here, I'm going to take you out and show you the time of your life.
Since I couldn't help you learn to use the toilet, I found something that can.
Peter, that pig... could be in our stomachs in, like one minute, and then we could... and then... and then we could do other stuff.
People see my diaper, and they say : Oh, how cute! I bet he smells like baby powder.
They see your diaper and think : Ew! That dog is sick. He must be dying. I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet. Why don't they just put him to sleep?
I know! What the hell is this supposed to be, a pelican or a school bus?
If he won't listen, I'm just going to have to go talk to Bill Clinton myself.
I swiped some money out of Lois's purse. I don't think she'll notice because she's here humping you?!
I know nothing I could say to you could possibly justify why I slept with Bill except...
I mean, Peter, the man presided over the longest economic expansion in US history, and he reduced the percentage of Americans on welfare to its lowest level in 33 years.
Apparently, there's the side of Bill Clinton the world knows, and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side only I know.
I've been a worse wife than Lorena Bobbitt when she was married to The Thing.
Look, Peter, I know this is a very difficult time for you, but I want you to know I'm here for you if you need anything.
But I think I've got a solution that will make things right for both of us.
Well... the way I figure it, the only way to even things out between us is if you have sex with someone else, too.
Well, that's the thing. I mean, there's only two phones in the... well, in the world, and one of them is in my office, and the other's in your office, and those two didn't even exist until about a few hours ago.
All right, Peter, who's it going to be? Who do you want to sleep with?
Deep down, in your heart of hearts, if it could be anyone in the world, who would it be?
I haven't been so struck by a woman's beauty since I was Uma Thurman's eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.
So you can go ahead and say what you're going to say, and my natural response could be to get offended.
Well, Peter and I have hit a snag in our marriage. I won't go with the details.
But it turns out that the only way to make things right seems to be...
You have no idea where I come from, where I've been, how long I've been there, what I had to do to get from where I was to where I am now!
When you signed the lease, you said there was going to be like five of you living here.
Well, since you keep ruining them, I'm not going to buy you a brand-new one.
Yes, I'll take this teddy bear, this ruler, this piece of string and this cardboard box.
Well, I guess I can still play with it three weeks out of the month.
Say, you look like you could use an activity book with half the activities done.
All right, so we roll the dice and then we both have to yell Yahtzee really loud.
Yes, I'd rather look at Meg toweling off after a shower when she does that butt floss thing.
Lois, I have never been more comfortable as a person than I am in these feety pajamas.
You remember? I used to say : What would it feel like to be a bear?
Your pajamas created a charge of electricity when you dragged your feet across the carpet, and when you touched Chris, you passed it on.
I got to tell you, you're pissing me off worse than when I watched the O.J. verdict with my old roommate.
Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess, when you called me I sort of misunderstood what you were asking for.
All the movers and shakers and bigwigs are going to eat here... but not the small wigs.
Hey, Lois, Diamond Jim Brady over here just asked if we accept the Discover card.
You know, you know, I would rather take two live chickens than your fly-by-night credit card.
I would rather take a jar of pennies that's value was less than that of your bill.
Oh, look, it's one of those early Maude episodes with the really long opening credit sequence.
All right, Violet and Pigpen, you've been seeing each other a few weeks now. What seems to be the problem?
But how can you leave me now, Ben Stiller, when I need you more than ever?
Oh, God. I hope there's not one of those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys with the bandana on his head. Oh! There he is.
I don't care about that. I wanted a cool restaurant, not the cafeteria at the veteran's hospital.
That's right, Diane. If you're handicapped, or know someone who's handicapped, or just happen to be a fan of the circus, then come on down to Big Pete's House of Munch, where the elite without feet meet to eat.
Peter, I like our restaurant the way it is, and if you don't, that's your problem.
Fine, if that's the way you want it, but we're not going to go down easy.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid he'll never walk again... without remembering how lucky he is that he'll only be in this wheelchair for two weeks.
It ain't my fault that him and all his gimpy friends don't fit in with regular society.
I thought you and your friends were just a bunch of gross cripples, but I've been in a wheelchair for 45 minutes now, and I see how tough it is.
Well, Peter, it's been a rough week for both of us, but it means a lot to me to hear you say that.
My character is a therapist living in the city, but I'm married to an elephant.
Well, I don't know if I can compete with the rest of these people, but here goes.
Well, finally! Some of us have been waiting all evening for a certain wife to come home and feed her starving family.
Peter, I told you I was going to be late. Couldn't you have handled dinner?
That's like asking me to choose between Sarah Jessica Parker and Kirsten Dunst in a hotbody/weird face contest.
It also means that this family is going to start going to church again on Sundays.
Being there today reminded me of how important religious services are to the moral fiber of a family.
A reading from the letter of John to the couple with the crying baby upstairs. Obviously you hearyour kid crying and you're trying to break him of some habit. But I got news for you. It's not working. I swear to God if it doesn't stop,
You know, all I wanted was for us to share a simple Sunday church service as a family.
We're here to take custody of your baby so that the good reverend here can perform an exorcism and banish the devil from his infant soul.
In Imagination Land, where you burp where you fart, and you fart where you burp.
That's going to be like trying to get Sneakers O'Toole to take his sneakers off.
Authorities are on the look out for one-year-old Stewie Griffin, a Quahog infant who is believed to be possessed by Satan.
I was about to bone my girlfriend out at the lake, but suddenly she yelled, so I looked up and it was bigfoot.
Then I went back to bone her, but the mosquitoes were going crazy, and she said there was no way.
Oh, did you hear that cashier's accent? Would you like some change please for you?
You know, they say Chuck Norris is so tough there's no chin under his beard.
At the top of the news tonight, authorities have called off their pursuit of a fugitive Rhode Island baby who was thought to be possessed by the devil.
This turn of events came after Vatican scientists announced today that the devil is not the greatest threat to salvation due to last week's discovery of the Superdevil.
Well, let me try and give you a clear picture of what we're dealing with here.
The Superdevil is at least six inches taller, he has a flying motorcycle and a jar of marmalade that we believe forces you to commit adultery.
He is a graceful, majestic creature who is a part of this family and only wants you to love and respect... The horse may have pooped in the bed.
You got to sneak on to the Crawford Ranch and steal a pair of George Bush's underwear.
I sing, I do gymnastics, and I can play seven instruments at the same time.
He's already got his sugar cut up into neat little lines for his breakfast tomorrow.
But, along the way, I learned about honesty, integrity, and cold filtered Miller Genuine Draft.
Well, the cheers is when they generally approve of something on television, and jeers is when they find some sort of fault with it.
I can't come over. We're still on the run because the town thinks Stewie's possessed.
Wait a minute. You... you've known for weeks, and you've been lying about having to stay here?
I agree, Lois. Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that, you're an idiot.
Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves.
You know, Ted, don't you think it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s to always be talking about getting married rather than getting laid?
And with a name like The Nutcracker I thought, Oh, this will be worth a few yuks, but no, Lois, that title wrote a check that those queers on stage refused to cash.
I have a history test today, Mom, and I couldn't study last night because you made us go to the ballet.
Well, Chris, you're not gonna learn any history from this. This textbook is from 1948.
What the hell? Are the schools so underfunded that they can't afford text books from this century?
Let's not forget the tax they levied on properties that are in abutment of church lands.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but the No Child Left Behind law cost us our federal funding because our students' test scores were too low.
I suppose there is one thing I can do to raise the school's test average.
But if I leave now, I won't hear who's the dumbest kid in the school.
Our curriculum consists of being on boats for long periods of time with men, just men for many days at a time.
Up on the deck with lots of men or down in the galley with lots of men.
You know, I have to admit I've always been a little worried about Chris, but
I guess I just convinced myself things would work out for him, but with no education, what kind of future can he possibly have?
You know, I drive by this place all the time and I've never been inside; isn't that funny?
Yeah, they couldn't seat us for like an hour, so we ended up coming here
I can see why. I mean, th-that halibut was... that, may have been the best halibut I've ever had.
And every other school we've tried just doesn't seem to be a good fit for Chris.
Chris got expelled from James Woods High, and, well, I was wondering if you could get him into that fancy boarding school you went to.
He has to shoot and starin' a shot-for-shot remake of Liar, Liar for my amusement.
I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.
Oh, you must be our new dorm mate. I'm Rogers Chapstick, heir to the Chapstick fortune.
I still don't fully understand! ...and that was the third time I slept with Katherine Harris.
Well, as anyone in Florida will tell you, she knows how to rig an erection.
One time I picked my nose and I swear I could feel the bottom of my eye.
This is where the most powerful men in the world are groomed for their futures.
The Skull and Bones Society has been a part of my family for decades, and we want you to become a member.
I guess I'll see if I can get my old gig back selling buttscratchers at the ballpark.
The first Thursday of every month we go to a local orphanage, pick out a kid, fill out all the paperwork and then don't take him home. It's hilarious.
Chris, I'd give you a hug, but I'm exhausted from working two jobs to pay your tuition.
As is customary with all our new members, you now have to spend seven minutes in the closet with our most senior member.
Well, I suppose I could pull some strings if that's really what you want, Chris.
Now remember, kids, when we get to Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch anything before I have a chance to disinfect it.
This'll be much better than that vacation we took with the Price Is Right yodeler.
Just be careful 'cause they got a lot of big ol' wilderness bugs out here.
I'm just gonna head on over to that flower and suck on that stamen like there's no tomorrow.
All right,here's a little tune inspired by one of the great legends of the Old West.
It's, like,a half-hour commute. And she said, I don't mind. It's on the way to my kid's preschool.
What kind of world is this where you can't even trust the oil companies anymore.
I just used to think... he was kind of funny. We should, uh, we should get to the hospital.
I mean, you couldn't possibly have sanctioned that kind of blatant industrial pollution, could you?
Well, I am not gonna stand by while you let this town be destroyed by corruption.
Which leads many political analysts to ask the question, Can a woman really be mayor, or will she just menstruate all over the city? Stay with us.
Chris, why don't you put these upstairs in your closet so we don't lose them?
Hi, I'm going door-to-door to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin who's offering real change for the city of Quahog.
I mean, Lois is my wife, and if she's the mayor we can pretty much do whatever the hell we want.
Ma'am, I know that you're going through a difficult time right now, but I just have a few more questions.
Are you aware that Lois Griffin has a plan to cut property tax in half over the next three years?
Well, you say number two did it, maybe I say I smell alcohol on your breath.
I've been having sex with every woman in town nonstop for the past two days.
Welcome, Quahog, to the town hall mayoral debate between incumbent Adam West and challenger Lois Griffin.
Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel about those computer websites that put a blue square on the home of a sex offender?
Well, the safety of our children is a very important part of my plan for Quahog.
Well, the election results are poring in and it looks like it's gonna be a tight one.
The last of the votes have been tallied and we're getting the final results in now.
Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian, but mostly I'm excited about all the good I'm gonna get to do.
And the first thing I'm going to do as mayor is clean up Lake Quahog.
And I think we all realize the importance of stopping the environmental damage being done to Lake Quahog, which is why I'm proposing a very modest tax increase that will help us to...
Hitler is plotting with... with the Legion of Doom... to assassinate Jesus... using the lake as a base.
At the top of the news, Lake Quahog is once again clean, thanks to the efforts of newly elected mayor, Lois Griffin.
And if you look around, I think even the wildlife is starting to come back.
Besides, there was a lot left over after the lake cleanup and I figured maybe I earned a little treat, huh?
Well, I think you're doing a great job, Mrs. Griffin, but my boss would kill me.
All I ask in return is that you let my company do just a little bit of dumping in your lake.
Eh, I'll just take him for a ride in the car, he'll forget all about it.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Quahog Oil Refinery, we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin for our newest waste pipe.
Yeah. I mean, it's only visible if you're looking from exactly the right angle, like the entrance to Hogwarts.
I like having a family. I got all the crazy out of my system when I was 18.
Grim news from Daytona, Florida, where the remains of three female college students were found near a local nightclub.
All right, now I want you to meet me at this address in an hour, and we'll slap five there.
I figured Scott Baio was androgynous enough that we could both fantasize about him, and no one would be gay.
Lois, we got the rest of our lives for me to not hear a word you just said, but tonight, I got plans with Cleveland.
It was even better than the time I stumbled into that fat, lonely women's club.
You know, where the woman wakes up in the hospital, and all the doctors are pigs?
Geez, Brian, that's more ridiculous than the theory of why Tom Cruise runs in all his movies.
Now, at some point during that evening, you did something that changed the course of your history, causing the time line to skew off into an alternate tangent, where you're married to Molly Ringwald,
Quagmire's married to Lois, and for some reason, we have a chalk boarding the living room.
You ever hear the theory that if you kill a butterfly in the past, it can drastically alter the present?
Hey, did you guys hear on the news about President Gore hunting down and killing Osama Bin Laden with his bare hands?
I know. Who would've thought Bin Laden was hiding out in the cast of Mad TV.
I mean, there was a time back when we dated that I thought you might be the one, but as I recall, you were more interested in partying with your friends.
We've got to get Death to send us back to 1984 again so I can undo what I did.
Well, the only one who can help us is Death, and he only shows up when somebody dies.
And with zero tolerance gun control and a strong, well-funded educational system, there's no street crime.
Face it, Peter, you not marrying Lois was the best thing that ever happened to the world.
Listen, you've got to send me back in time again so I can marry Lois.
Dick Cheney, the chairman of Halliburton, shot Supreme Court Justice Scalia in a hunting accident, and the bullet went right through him and killed Karl Rove and Tucker Carlson.
This is the exact moment in 1984 that I sent you to the first time.
That we could both fantasize about him and no one would be gay, yeah, I know the joke.
I wanted to surprise you with the invitation last night, but you never showed up.
Peter, the Country Club Dance is where Lois said she fell in love with Quagmire.
And not Quagmire or any man, she-male, robot or sentient robot curious about its own existence is going to keep you from me!
And I'm touched that you went through so much trouble just to be with me.
And, hey, let's just all be grateful that things are completely back to normal again.
We got halfway home with the afterbirth, then had to go back and swap it for Meg. The end.
I got a better one. This is a story of love and loss, fathers and sons, and the foresight to retain international merchandising rights.
Hold your fire. There's no life forms aboard. Hold your fire?! Are we paying by the laser now?
(Darth Vader) My God, look at this mess! Darth Vader's gonna be here. Shall we clean up? No, it's OK, he won't mind.
You can kiss the lower part of the back of the canister that is my body.
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they obtained.
Well, I mean, there's this little hole - it was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect - and if you shoot a laser into this hole, the station blows up.
Exactly. And to get within range of it, you have to skim along a trench. It's no big deal.
Lord Vader, your inside references to the Los Angeles real estate market haven't given you the clairvoyance to turn a profit on that condo in Glendale. Nor...
If I pass out, note I'm wearing a LifeCall bracelet with all my insurance information.
Aunt Beru, when are you guys gonna let me join the rebellion like all my friends?
One day, I'm just gonna take off and join the rebellion, whether you like it or not.
I am overstocked on intergalactic, proton-powered, advertising droids, and I am passing the savings on to you!
There's two suns and no women - what the hell am I supposed to do?!
(Limbaugh) My good friends, the liberal galactic media is at it again. They never stop.
Now they're trying to convince us Hoth is melting. It's just trying to scare us.
And if that weren't enough to get you mad, we now have news that Lando Calrissian has been made the chief administrator of the Bespin Mining Facility.
That's not what I said. I said, There ain't a pack of menthols on this planet.
Wait a minute, they're Sand People, all right. I can see one of 'em now.
And, not to get too personal, but you owe us after that mess you got into back on Alderaan.
This is just, like, logistical stuff. I'll check that later. ... Joey Lawrence haircut. So I'll assume we can count on your help to get the Death Star plans to my father on Alderaan.
Luke, you must learn the ways of the Force and come with me to Alderaan.
But if they find out who the Jawas sold them to, that could lead them back... home!
It's way easier to get into these clubs if you have chicks in your group. Noticed that?
I heard voices, but they stopped, so I'm gonna assume there's no one in there.
Hi. My sexy friend and I are looking for a ship to take us to Alderaan, and I'm willing to pay big money.
Well, you've come to the right place. I'm Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon, and the only actor whose career isn't destroyed by this movie.
Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was just going to see Jabba and tell him...
Thank you. This was my brother's. He died of leukaemia. How do you feel now?
I'll show you around, since no one's trying to stop the ship or blast us.
Well, we're not in the same place we were. Huh? That ought to confuse 'em.
Governor Tarkin. I recognised your foul stench as soon as I was brought on board.
Princess Leia, we've chosen to test our Death Star, planet-blower-upper gun on your home planet of Alderaan.
So anyway, I says, Forget the dental plan, forget sick leave, I just want a railing.
While some view the attack as unwarranted, the Empire has obtained proof that Alderaan was in possession of weapons of mass destruction.
You mean that thing you just found out about and are now judging me for not believing in?
What the hell? Oh, my God! We came out of hyperspace into an asteroid field.
Maybe we should head for that small moon that's clearly a small moon, not anything else.
You know, Luke, this may be the last time we see each other, so there's something I want you to know.
(Han) No, no. Here's the Banana Republic, and we just passed that. It's right back there.
Now, we parked on the Macy's side, so now we must be over here by JC Penney.
(Luke) The first floor is mostly men's stuff, and there's a Lady Foot Locker there.
(Han) Let's get in the elevator. And hurry up, cos the smell of that Mrs. Fields is killing me.
And do you, Alan, take Judith to be your lawfully wedded wife, till death or a giant explosion do you part?
Is funny because you are prisoner. And there is no pool because is Death Star.
We had a weapons malfunction, but everything's perfectly all right. We're fine. We're all fine... here... now.
Why don't you try seeing each other more often and see if you connect more?
This is Han Solo. I'll be keeping you company for the next few hours on the midnight shift.
When we get out of here maybe you can show me around your home planet of Alderaan. Aw!
I think... I think... I think I may be having sort of a mini freakout here.
And look at this couch! Somebody threw out a whole couch, and it's in great shape.
You put Febreze on that, scrub it out a bit, it'll look great in your apartment.
You know what? I know we have a dangerous job to do here, but I'm taking this. I'm taking this couch.
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler. It's easier than we're making it.
You know that last drill we had? I was about to finally bone my girlfriend, then we heard that there was this drill and she told me there was no way.
You get in the cockpit, and I'll just hang onto this thing as we go.
I mean, sometimes the brain is still active for a few minutes after the beheading, but to be honest, I can't imagine a worse kind of hell.
And unfortunately, hell is probably where he'll end up, because the Christians don't look too kindly on the whole Force thing.
I'd killed Obi-Wan, then I look over and there are two dudes scurrying across with a couch.
Thanks to the information in this R2 unit provided by Princess Leia, we should be able to mount a successful offensive on the Death Star.
There are gonna be so many folks coming at you to slow you down, you might feel like you got a bull's-eye on your head.
Also, don't forget you have teammates out there watching your back - unless you been messing around with their wife or girlfriend!
Lastly, you wanna make sure you step back and take cover after you sink that bucket, cos that sky gonna light up like the Fourth of July.
Hey, Luke. I was under a Y-wing, working on the space engine, and the whole thing just dropped on me.
Let's see, I got 10% off a Netflix membership, um... some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar, assorted lotions, and a little plastic champagne bottle full ofjellybeans, and a little bear.
Don't worry about it. I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.
It's the highest-rated show on Cartoon Network, and the Star Wars episode doubled that audience.
Don't be glib about this stuff. It's a legitimate show, and they beat you to the punch.
I don't know about that, Chris. To me, a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC.
You know, Doctor, you said you were going to cure my cancer, but all you did was rape me!
Well, you're right, about the rape part, but I'm sorry, you still do have cancer.
Meg, lend me 25 cents so I can ride the toy airplane outside and make the immigrant kids jealous.
Here's my summary of every Vince Vaughn movie: Oh, I'm incapable of loving another person. Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end.
I don't have any money so I'm going to have to pay for these comic books with my poo.
Chris, how come you don't have any money? I thought you had a paper route.
No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father, who's a pilot, that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country.
Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta gather all these old World War II pilots to help him rescue his father.
Well, well, in mine, one of the World War II guys is Japanese, but they accept him anyway.
Anyway, all I was saying is, if you think about it, it shouldn't have been Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Yeah. And he was so on that day, so it kind of works on two levels.
Well, I don't know what you mean by that, but how about that Cameron, huh?
That is just what I was going to... His day off... that is just what I was going to say. You know, you are a catch, young lady.
I don't know when the hell Brian is going to open his eyes and get serious with you.
Well, I think you should, Brian. She's beautiful, she's funny, and she is smart as the day is wide.
And if you're never going to get serious, then you're not being fair to her.
I will ask her to move in with me. and you'll see, I've got what it takes.
Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian, this move is really working out great.
She was in A Beautiful Mind, and I've gotta say, the direction was excellent but I was very disappointed that she, um... wore clothes the entire film.
Yeah, in the way that, like, classy women with expensive clothing who never take the moff are hot, you know?
All right. So, like, you see a hotgirl, and you're like, okay, I appreciate your exterior beauty
'cause you definitely worked at it with the clothing, and the jewelry, and the makeup and stuff, but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man... where is the chase and how do I cut to it?
Well, go see that movie and absorb its message, and you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about.
Hey, by the way, you know who else is hot in kind of a screwed up way?
Yeah, yeah, in that sort of you think you could get her, cause she could be your brother kind of thing.
One of those underrated actresses that was always talented and beautiful, and never quite popped, if you know the meaning.
He's a failed writer who just decides that, Ooh, I'm going to have a big last hurrah in Las Vegas.
And then he meets a whore and pays her a bunch of money to stay with him, uh, and have sex with him while he murders himself slowly.
And, you know, she's game for it, but she catches feelings midway through and the whole thing changes.
Because you wanted me to move in so badly, and God knows, I didn't want to...
Look, Brian, I know you're upset now, but I think it's important to see things in perspective.
There you are. That's just the kind of can-do spirit that built this nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
The only job I could find was for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.
You know, it would mean the world to her if she could get her job back.
Ground ball to shortstop. The throw is to second, and again, the ball sails past LaGrange into right field.
The runners will score and a cascade of boos rain down from the stands as clearly the fans' sympathy for this scrappy, little no-armed man has run out.
Now, granted the throw was a little wide, but you've got to believe that a two-armed player would've made the catch.
In fact a one-armed player would have at least had a shot at it, which calls to mind the question once again, why, with all the two-armed youngsters waiting in the minor leagues, does this team stick with an arm-less second baseman?
Come on, time for you to meet some women who are going to make you forget about Jillian.
No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass. I-I don't want her back in here.
Look, Stewie, get these stupid '80s movie robots out of here, and leave me alone.
I really appreciate what you did for me, but I can't work for that guy anymore.
Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian, but it is good to have you back.
Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe you got another chapter for your book.
Hey, check it out, you guys, I got a new cell phone that takes pictures.
Yeah, you guys talk about this place all the time, we figured we'd give it a try.
Bernice, we haven't really been dating long enough for you to be hanging out with my friends' wives.
Fellas, our way of life is being threatened and we got to do something about it.
What do you care, Lois? You girls got the Clam, we got the Quahog Men's Club.
All right, Peter, this is a tough one. All right you ready for this? Okay, would you have sex with Cleveland. if it meant you could have sex with Angelina Jolie.
Missionary, and you have to look him in the eyes, no closing your eyes and pretending it's somebody else.
You know, I know this is a men's club but why does it always have to be about sex?
Does he have an idea, or do I have to come up with it myself?
I'd have to give it to Janet Reno, 'cause I've always had this business plan for a home delivery of prescription medications, and that seems like it's more her market.
Let's go stand over near Brian, and we'll take a drink every time he says bonerific.
I was walking by your house the other day, and, uh, I poked my head in the window and Betty was undressing.
She didn't stop. I mean, she saw me there, looking at her and she kept undressing.
Society wants your pants to be intact, but you're just not gonna listen, are you?
Those idiots have done nothing but hang out in that stupid shed for the last two days.
All right, so I'm skulking around the intensive care unit, and all of sudden this smoking hot chick...
I mean, I knew what to expect after, you know, Joe's accident, and I'm prepared to live the rest of my life this way.
I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese, but I'm not sure if any cosmetic surgery is even possible.
If you'd be willing to sign a waiver, I think I may be able to help you.
Yeah, you know, we've never really had any extended interactions, so I've never noticed it.
Now, Mr. Swanson, through the magic of digital imaging, we'll select the legs most suited to your body from our inventory of donors.
Ah, good choice. These are the only ones we have in stock that aren't hilarious.
Ah, this is fantastic! This is even better than they said it was in the brochure!
I've got working legs for the first time in 15 years, and I'm gonna use them.
My God, we haven't done it in so long, I had forgotten how big you were.
I want to do all the things I could never do when I was handicapped.
And you guys are my best friends. I want you to experience it all with me.
Nothing could be grander than to be in Louisiana In the mornin', in the morn...
Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted since I had that job as Jackee Harry's personal grocery shopper.
Where the hell am I supposed to...? And what is this, a drum of grape jam?
Okay, you stay right here, big funny gal. I'll be right back with... a hammock of cake.
Well, Peter, I realized over the last few days, the only reason I hung out with you guys is that I was crippled and you were lazy.
Well, Peter, there have been a lot of changes in Joe's life, and maybe he just needed to move on.
If I were you, I'd look for a new friend. A kindred spirit, like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.
I was thinking about how I wanted to find the son of God and nail him to some wood.
So, do you really think you're suited to be the fourth guy in our group, Buzz Killington?
Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here in the booth and crack jokes, but you're kind of a buzz kill.
And then the bastard completely blew me off to hang out with those new douche bags.
And once our injuries heal up, we can all go for a nice, long walk.
I know it's a little self-centered, but this is my favorite day of the year.
Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian meant for me to go with him, did you?
Yeah, be good till we get back, and Brian, stay out of the cat box!
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bar you from the aft section of the ship for the rest of the cruise.
Then I'm gonna make her crawl on her hands and knees while I drip hot candle wax all over her back.
You're gonna bitch and moan, and then you're gonna do what you always do : the minute Lois walks through that door, you're gonna forget all about it, beg for your apple juice, go poop and fall asleep.
I turned to my first mate and I said, We are looking into the very eyes of God.
All right, so we're driving up to get this abortion and we get to the abortion clinic and the abortionist has one hand.
So I turn to Lois and I says, You want to get an abortion here? You want to get an abortion with the abortionist having a stump hand? We can't get an abortion here.
So, we turned around and went home and two-and-a-half months later our daughter Meg was born.
Well, send me the crap to hell for being nostalgic about the early years of our marriage.
With all the indignities I've been forced to suffer day in and day out under your matriarchal tyranny.
And finally, still no word on the disappearance of Lois Griffin, housewife and mother from Quahog who vanished from a cruise ship six days ago.
It's been six days, Peter. I'm sorry, but we had to call off the search.
Finish your oatmeal, and then I'll get you ready for our Mommy and Me class.
Which is just what someone who pulled off the perfect murder would want you to think.
Right after we had that big fight when I said, I wish you were dead, right before I never saw her again.
Either of you guys think it's a little suspicious that Peter took out a life insurance policy on Lois right before she went missing?
No, but really, New York City's a great place to live... if you're a cockroach.
I was hoping to keep these mementos, Rupert, but I can't risk it with the dog sniffing around for evidence.
Well, the trail is pretty cold by now, but if Peter did kill Lois, we might find some clues in his garbage.
Can't believe it's been 12 months since I've deliberately choked myself by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges down my throat.
We can, um, put you at the, um, scene where she, um, was, um, killed.
Look, don't you kids buy any of this for a second. Your father is innocent.
Yes, and as a favor to the court, I've produced this simulation of how the killing transpired.
Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid, and I fart at times that ruin my father-in-law's social occasions, and that's why I'm never invited to them.
Only in front of the kids to assert my status as dominant male of the pride
We now go live to Olie Williams recaping the events of the last episode of Family Guy.
I mean, not tonight 'cause I've got plans with the guys, but tomorrow night, I want to hear all about it.
I would have been dead if it hadn't been for a passing merman... who treated my wounds and carried me to safety.
It sounds romantic, I know,  but unfortunately, he was kind of a reverse of what you'd expect a merman to be.
After wandering around for a while, I discovered I was in North Carolina where I managed to get a job at a summer camp for fat kids.
Over the next several months, I developed a relationship with a seemingly nice young townie named Derek.
Okay, first order of business, uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy, who have agreed to bring cookies for next week's punch social.
Last week when I made that macaroni picture of an owl, you didn't give a damn!
Uh, I don't know.He kind of asked me. I think we should do what he says.
Well, thank you, Brian. That's gonna get me through the rest of this yard work. No, just kidding.You suck.
You forget I'm the one holding the gun, Brian, and you're gonna do exactly as I say.
I'll be as big as I should have been when I was on American Idol.
Yo, dawg, I got to tell you for me, man, that was not even half good, dude.
Next time they hear 'bout me, they, they's gonna be, like, We was wrong about Stewie, cause I's gonna be huge.
Hey, hey, you know what we should do, guys, while we're here tied up like this?
And then when we get outta here, we'll spread it around as much as we can.
Somebody told me he goes down to Home Depot and pays the migrant workers to go to his house and choke him in the shower.
Well, get pissy if you want, Mom. I've enjoyed the time we've had as a family.
There's got to besome clue in here that'll tell us where Stewie might have gone.
This is it, Brian! My plan for world domination is about to come to fruition.
Once I locate the proper code sequence, this terminal will allow me to take command of the satellites which control the world's power grid.
I now control the entire planet's power grid, and unless you want me to send you all back to the Dark Ages, you'll do exactly as I say.
We interrupt this program to bring you a special message from the new president of the world.
Hey, I don't give a damn what you want! Just get the hell off of my property!
Look, Hilary, all I know is it's breakfast time, I've got this bowl of Corn Flakes, and I gotta beat work at at 9:00 So what are we going to do here?
Not so fast.Did you know you'd have to eat 17 bowls of those Corn Flakes to get the same nutritional value in one bowl of Total?
Also, as I've had quite enough of the fat man, anyone who sees Peter Griffin must throw apples at him.
And, finally, anyone who uses the terms irregardless, a whole 'nother or all of the sudden shall be sent to a work camp.
Peter, I am not going to stand by while other people suffer at the hands of my own baby.
Dinner's in the oven. All you have to do is turn it to 350 at about 5:15.
Oh, hello, Brian. Well, you recall my complaining about Lois and the fat man not taking me with them?
Well, you said I didn't have it in me to kill Lois, so I was just running a simulation to find out exactly how killing her and taking over the world would play out for me.
So, what you're saying is that what you experienced in the simulation didn't really happen or even matter.
Yes, but theoretically, if someone watched the events of that simulation from start to finish, only to find out that none of it really happened,
I mean, you don't think that would be just like a giant middle finger to them?
Born on the Fifth of July, which he promises will be even July-ier than the original.
Mom, how come, when we see these guys on the street corner, you tell me not to stare a and today that's all we're doing?
I am proud to be an American, and I am going to love my country like never before.
You never really feel them love you back, but that's okay because they got other stuff going on, and you understand.
Peter, you do realize there's a difference between loving America and being swept up dans la parano post 9/11.
I just had my penis tattooed to look like the space shuttle and my nads tattooed to look like launch exhaust.
Oh, well, maybe I can do something else like-like... like the Space Needle or a banana... or a Sharpie.
Man, that reallymakes me mad-- illegal immigrants coming into this country, taking all the good jobs away from Americans.
Well, I am goingto make sure people like that stay out of Quahog from now on.
We are going to patrol the borders and keep this townas clean as a Jewish porno.
All right, guys, it's going to be a long night of border patrol, so I brought along Michael McDonald to help us out.
How's he gonna know what we're saying? - How's he gonna know what we're saying
Because Speedy Gonzales is an immigrant and a bad influence on our children, so I created his Americanequivalent
I think Fuad is an illegal immigrant, and I cannot stand by while he steals wages and opportunities from citizens.
You don't see Nike or Microsoft or General Motors or Ford or Boeing or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's profiting from non-American labor.
Maybe we should run a company-wide check to make sure all our personnel are legal citizens.
This country needs more immigrants like my cousin, Peter the pig, needs a new house.
Because I just made stool in there, and if you blow it down, the whole woods is gonna stink.
Hey, uh, there'sa new policy at work where everyone has to prove they're an American, and I need my birth certificate.
I was so afraid of being judged by the community that I never filled out the paperwork to make you a citizen
So far, you've failed everything, including the Behaving like an American at the airport test.
I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza so I got something to stuff in my face while I'm reading USA Today.
Question number two, complete this sentence: The land of the free and the home of the blank.
Now look, don't get upset, but I've been so worried about you that I asked someone for help.
They just takeone DVD a month from the house they're cleaning until they have a respectable collection.
Peter, I'm using you as a house immigrant, so take my family's luggage to their rooms and then go get settled down at the servants quarters.
Oh, but it's okay because the ball is on a string and attached to the cup.
There are tall buildings, cheeseburgers and Fox's many hit comedy series, including That '70s Show, and, uh...
We come to America for financial opportunities, Peter, but someday we will return to Mexico because our heritage is rich and glorious.
Are you saying there's more to being Mexican than working hard and lusting after big asses?
For example, I used to hate the Japanese, but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips in Young Guns and now I don't hate them anymore.
Look, I don't care what day it is Mexico, in America we work on weekdays.
Now, do your jobs or I'll deport your lazy asses back to the Third World.
But men like Carter Pewterschmidt use us for cheap labor, and then-and then try to punish us when we demand to be treated like human beings.
Immigrants built this country, and I say it's time for us to take it back!
Well, I mean, technically it's yours, but we don't feel like you deserve it, so, we're calling it ours and taking it anyway.
All I have to do is make one call to friend of mine in Washington, and he can push your paperwork through.
A land where meals are not purchased from a truck and then eaten in a different truck.
Tom, residents all over Quahog have been affected by the heavy rains, although some are doing their best to ride it out.
I like riding the ten-speed because it's fun, it gives me energy, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
Uh, it's not too demanding, the pay is good, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
I'm living life before the cancer I have kills me so I don't mind the rain.
Water feels good on my skin. It's cool, refreshing, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
It's a quick process, both painful and untreatable, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
Thank you, Tricia. Some local residents have even been evacuated to Quahog Stadium for their own protection.
And for God's sake,do not be afraid to make me a sandwich while you're in there.
I mean, she's my only daughter, and I feel like I've never treated her as well as I should've.
Well, yes, I-I suppose to the untrained eye that's what it would look like. Walk inside with me, Brian.
This is disgusting--it smells, it's falling apart, and you can hear the mice humping in the wall.
Wow, Peter, I got to say, you've really been true to your word about treating Meg better.
She needs to be protected, like a rare gemstone, or the herniated scrotum of an older gentleman.
This guy may look harmless on the outside, but on the inside he could be a complete bastard, like Fred Flintstone.
But when I want to get my rocksoff, you're nowhere to be found you passive-aggressive bitch.
Maybe he's two dwarves in an overcoat wanting to see what sex is like with a big person.
I'm not gonna let Meg turn out like my Nerf football in the hall closet.
I just think Meg is really cool, and I want to get to know her better.
You know, Michael,my daughter's womb is not a wild firefor you to douse with your adolescent seed.
You ever sit on your arm till it falls asleep, and then play with yourself and pretend like somebody else is doing it?
You get started with this dry wall and I'm gonna start pulling out those old floorboards in the kitchen.
Uh, Meg, I'm not sure, but I think dad is sitting at that table over there.
Meg, it's only because I want to make sure this guy treats you right and doesn't try anything funny.
All right, Brian, I'm going to go up to the upper level and run this wire down through the wall.
Wait, if you haven't started feeding it, why'd you ask me if I could see it?
I said why'd you ask me if I could see it, if you haven't started feeding it? Over.
For the record, I don't want to hang out with you anymore when this is over.
Wait a minute. I have to say over even if the sentence ends with the word over?
Ah, now see? That's an even more beautiful sight than 72 virgins waiting in heaven for a suicide bomber.
I'm starting to think maybe we bit off a little more than we could chew.
I'm not saying an abortion, per se, maybe you just drink and smoke a lot.
Just don't stop doing it and then chicken out halfway through the pregnancy, because then you'll wind up with Chris.
Oh, and they were all out of the bride and groom figurines, so I got the Iron Giant and a courtroom doll that kids use to show where the molester touched them.
'cause I don't need to see what you crazy girls are going to do while I'm gone.
I have never been more in love with someone than I am with you right now.
I guess sometimes a father just gets a little over protective of his daughter, but you got to know I was only thinking about your happiness.
I wish I could tell you that the Monopoly guy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
I imagine you're going to be much more of a stern father, now that you have a mustache.
But, mostly,my mustache tells people that there is a 90% chance that I am poorly educated, that I keep upscale pornziou the open and that I listen tothe Little River Band with giant headphones.
There is nothing that'll ever happen in the rest of our lives that's as important as what's going on right here, right now, in high school, by these lockers.
If you plopped me inthe middle of a high school, cobe the mpukid there in a week.
I'm gonna make you somehash browns for breakfast, and then, later, I'm gonna takeyou down to the whoreh to lose your virginity.
Boy, you know, I've alwayswanted to come in here, and now that I got a mustache,the timing feels right.
Come to think of it,I can't really feel anything on the left half of my body.
You can see them onmy MySpace page, along with my favorite songsand movies and things that other people have created, but that I use toexpress my individualism.
I- or rather, myalter ego, Zac Sawyer- am currently the most popular boy at James Woods High.
Do you know thatI've got a date with Connie D'Amico this Saturday night,at Anal Point?
Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it like a parking spacethat you think, Gosh, there's no way I'm gonna be ableto fit in there.
Well, in that scenario, it sounds like I'd rather be the parking spacethan the car.
I swearI'll get back at you someday for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.
Five minutes.I went in there they injected me with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam good ol'gambling man Peter.
They have a hundred lawyers, and you tried to bribe me with a subscription to Grape Soda Today which I already have.
You might have to help me out with the last ten or so because Mr. Happy gets tired- religion.
We're two Asian businessmen looking to invest in McBurgertown Industries and we'd like a tour of your facility.
I'm gonna find just the right piece of incriminating evidence to bring down this company.
At that time, our value meal consisted of a hamburger, a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.
I have to go to the bathroom for about 30 minutes as I eat a lot of meat.
If we can get you out of here, would you be willing to testify publicly about these atrocities?
The McBurgertown franchise suffered a publicity setback today from which it may not recover, thanks to testimony regarding its practices by a very brave cow.
I have revealed to you, today, these horrors in the hope that you will see the need for change.
The courage lies with a man who has the guts to say no to a fast food restaurant and eat a salad instead.
I'm going to be honoured with a big ceremony in Martha's Vineyard. they are going to put me up in luxury hotel, all expenses paid.
Uh... because my stomach is rumbling in a way that sounds like the engine of Joe's fishing truck.
Well, Lois, until we get an appointment secretary, things like this are gonna continue to fall through the cracks.
But he promised he'd go with me to put flowers on my grandmother's grave this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.
But tonight is our sex night, and a little physical release will do us both some good.
I don't need honey, Peter, I need a husband who wants to spend time with me.
Well, wait a minute, what about that nice old man who lives up the street?
All right, children, your mammy and pappy asked me to look after you for the next couple days.
No cussing, clean your plates, and only a half hour of radio and then it's off to bed.
And don't you mouth off to me or I'm gonna slap you right in your penis.
No offense, Mr. Herbert, but I'm a 17-year-old girl and I don't need you here.
Well, no offense to you, Meg, but you're a 17-year-old girl and I don't need you here.
And now, reading a passage from his grand prize-winning short essay, Amazing Grace, tonight's guest of honor,
Thank you very much. She was grace in name and in essence. To those she loved, she exuded strength, life, laughter and light. And to me, also sorrow. For circumstance had bound her to my best friend, through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home. Nothing from the first day I saw her and no one that has happened to me since has ever been as frightening and as confusing. For no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important and less significant.
Every time that we go to a hotel, you hide the key to the minibar from me.
You had an opportunity to share a beautiful moment with Brian and you wasted it, wasted it like the Osmond family wastes water.
Almost as potent as the inspiration you give me to plumb the deepest fathoms of my soul for a literary bounty of truth and loveliness.
Know anybody with a pair of strong, young hands to help me in and out of the tub?
Oh, I'd love to, but Peter and I were gonna get dinner at that little place by the...
Thanks. You know, Lois, I'm sure you've already figured this out, but... that essay I wrote- I wrote it about you.
I mean, things you say and things you do resonate with me in a big way.
And then when I hear that car coming up the driveway, I just go berserk.
We got wasted at the bar, and he ended up asking me to marry him.
So I convinced this minister to do the job, but the joke's on Nathan Lane,
Nantucket, Cape Cod, and all the great destinations that make Massachusetts the wondrous place it is.
Was he bigger than me? ... and they told Peter to stay away from the wolf.
And he knew that sometimes the things that seem the most dangerous turn out to be the most fun!
Lois is my wife, and... well, I mean, all the dry food I've bought for you over the years?
She does nothing but give and give and give, and you repay her with selfishness and neglect.
You couldn't even get Gillian to take you back, and she was dumber than Lou Ferrigno.
Well,yes. I mean, you and I have a lot in common, and we've spent so much time together over the years, and... of course, that essay you wrote, oh, it really touched my heart.
Well, to be honest, Lois, I ripped off most of that speech from Summer of '42.
But with you, I imagine it would be like doing it with a stuffed animal.
Well, we may be leaving Martha's Vineyard, but the spirit of this wonderful place will stay in our hearts all the way home.
Hey, you guys want to buy some gum or cotton candy or a stuffed animal?
Coming up, important traffic news that can't help you because you're some place where a TV is.
But first, get ready, Quahog, because Barry Manilow will be performing this weekend at the Quahog Performing Arts Center.
I was walking by when I picked up the smell of 11 herbs and spice... agh!
Agh, Peter,you and your excuses for losing your wallet. I dropped it at the concert. The hooker took it. It's with my other family.
Well, I locked you in a wooden crate and forgot to put an air hole in it.
Right, so I got my hand gun and I'm just randomly firing it into a crowd of people and then...
I hate to have to do this, but I'm afraid legally I have no choice.
For God's sake, I went to Brown and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
I gotta tell you though, there was some weird stuff going on over there today.
And that's why I contend that when Frost speaks of birch trees, he may very well be talking about himself.
You wanna hear my interpretation, or are you simply going to tell me that I'm wrong?
But this is poetry we're talking about, and I think when it comes to poetry, you can't be wrong.
Like the time I swallowed that midget who played Mini-Me just so I could make you laugh.
Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois- if my stomach had said,Hell yeah I'm hungry.
Well, I've got a way that you can eat all you want and look like a Hollywood starlet.
Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I had the same coke supplier, and he threw a punch social one day and we both happened to be there.
I play a window washer who has just finished washing the last window of the World Trade Center.
And then I turn around to get off the scaffold, and what do you think I see coming?
You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face, and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
Well, our top story continues to be the fall of actor James Woods, who almost overnight has gone from America's most beloved celebrity to America's most hated pariah.

Es con mucho dolor que digamos adios a Javier.. y Pepe y Carlos y Lupe, y otra Lu
It's like listening to those two foreign guys down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU. almost long enough to sound American.
Oh, man, what a good bunch of partying at that discotheque. eylad e mauence requests.
Well, this was a lot of effortfor nothing... like trying to tellMatthew McConaughey how much he sucks.
You know, Matthew, I-I may not ever getotr an to say this,so I just want to get this offmy chest.
You're one of the worst actors t hto ofi.. ...and I think that you needto go away.
The truth is I spendat least 90% of my year going away exploringexotic places, having sex with mybeautiful girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.
Money that I made off thteib fmsat I put out into the American populacebecause they just love to see me doing whatit is that I do.
Contact, they didn'teven need u tt vi They could have donethe whole movie without you.
I know. I know. I saidthe same thing. but they're just, like, Oh, we need agood-looking guy with a greaasanso thtbs to just provide some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.
Said the, saidthe same thing about that Bill Murrayelephant movie, but they were just, like,Oh, theudnc nd u.
You make me physicallysick to my stomach, and I wish that you would get aheart attack.
Truth of the mte isI n'li my movies either, but, man, they justkeep offering me money and I do it and I getto go around the world.
I mean, didyou see Sahara? te you whatthe move gave me was an opportunity to take an
It happened onnumerous occasions, and I was too idto tell anyone because I felt likesomehow it w mfat.
So to get out of hereI just make a left out of the driveway and drive as fastas I can?
Yeah, sort of a weird commentrit fntf l u Kinda thoughtthis was a team effort.
Nice kid. Say, Brian,now that I think about it, how can you possible havea 13-year-old son enouourselfare only seven?
Your life would havebeen more miserable than a lonely old widow livingin a downstairs apartment.
My mom wanted meto give you this. To Brian from Tracy.He's your obm w. P.S. Will you write mea letter of recommendation for the
Shut up, dude. You'rejust a fat old bastard. ll, not to get technical,sir, but you are the bastard.
I have a pet hedgehog named Zippy and I shall walk her to town, and each time my foot hits the ground, I shall say, Boing, boing, boing. m gi!
Oh, just a little something I do once a week around here ll aak t party.
Dylan put this paperbaony ad and I could not, for the life of me, figure out howto get it off.
I am gonna kick himout of this house faster than NASA kicked outthe Cocoa Puffs bird.
This isn't working out Alrit? don't carethat I'm your father, and you don't care that you're my son.
And then in chapter 28 of my novel, the other pilots finally trust the Japanese pilot and let him, let him into... their group.
Yeah. Um, I'm not really looking for notes, but you know, Dylan, I gotta tell you something.
It's okay. Look, I know I wasn't there for you man, for all those years, but...that's gonna change.
Was somebody looking for a son with a bright new path to adulthood and his very, very proud Dad?
From now on, I plan on being a real father to Dylan, and together, we are gonna turn his life around.
I am now in possession of hundreds of palettes of crudely painted, not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art, and it's just waiting to transform your uncut, trash-strewn lawn into a living canvas that tells passers-by, Hey, everyone, a real funny bugler lives here.
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly, and motorists will slow down and applaud when they cast their eyes on such favorites as...
Most of this stuff is price to move and until it does, it's an enormous fire hazard, so please, come see me, on Route 2 in Weekapaug.
I just think, you know, I just think, Oh, my God, what if Dylan were on that plane?
Until you have a child... Until you have a child, you do not understand. Okay?
I tell you, I wish that old hag of Brian's had never even told him he had a kid.
And, and, I do not want to have this conversation in front of my son.
Now Dylan can go back with his mom, and you can stop acting like such a jackass.
But that's only because I've truly connected with the one bit of flesh and blood that I have on this earth.
I'll always be grateful to you for turning my life around, but now, thanks to you, I finally have a chance to transform my mom's life in the same way you transformed mine.
We now return to busy business lady, whose life is missing something, but she doesn't realize it, because she's so busy with business.
I'd like to show you that all your problems can be solved by my penis.
Ehehe. Ain't that funny? He heard me say that on the way over in the cab.
Hey Peter, you kind of look like a pirat with that thing on your shoulder.
And you should have sex with that crossing guard, even though she looked young and then i found out she was 12.
Mom, can we go back to the vet and see the pretty vet assistant again?
After we've had our fill of bread and wine, we shall tell tales of other times we had our fill of bread and wine.
We'll see to it that no child ever received these as a last minute gift hastily bought on the way to the party.
I've got to get this shipment of sugarcane, tobacco and spices to the harbor before day's end.
I've screwed up worse than Disney did when they cast Michael J. Fox in that Zorro remake.
Then a passing nurse accidentally stepped on him and kicked him into a puddle of urin, which must have frightened him, because his bowels released all over himself.
I tried to pick him up, but then I got angry because some of it got on my thump.
Listen, I have to get back to work but, um, would you maybe wanna go out sometime?
You know, Anna when I first saw you, I thought you were the most beautiful girl in the world.
And now all I wanna do is show you my innermost self but I'm afraid you'll reject me, because you won't like what you see.
Or that you'll see my scrotum, and see that it has a seam on it, and then you'll think I'm made up of two different guys that were sewn together,
When I'm around a pretty girl, I'll get all worked up, like a kid watching a toy commercial.
I went on a date with this girl, that I really like, and, if you don't mind, I was hoping I could ask you a few questions, about the birds and the bees?
Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories, but I was kind of hoping to get some advice from someone who isn't broken from the waist down.
I have tons and tons of dogs to incinerate, but I can't wait to see you tomorrow night.
You, a man, are cleaning up a mess made by Anna, a woman, that she, also a woman, spilled on you, a man.
If you want to get anywhere with a chick, you can't treat 'em too nice-like.
I'm gald you called, but im not home, but I'll be back before too long,
You gotta wait for the beep, you gotta leave your name, you gotta leave your number, wait for the beep!
Ah yes, can I have two tickets, one man and one bitch that needs to do what I say.
Pick that up and cook it into something delicious or knit it into something that's useful to me!
What you said first was, what... well, I mean, what when two grown-ups love each other very much.
If you do, you'll feel as bad as I do when I miss the toilet.
Chris, this is Barbara, the girl from your class you used to have a crush on.
I dont' understand Chris, your Blind Date should be here by now, she answered the ad.
I know Dad's been trying to help and I'm trying to listen to him but nothing seems to be working.
Well, I know, I asked him to help but it occurs to me that you've been taking advice from everyone except the one person who matters.
Then you just need to go talk to her and tell her exactly how you feel.
Well, I'm sure you can come up with some excuse to see her at the vet.
Come on kids, people are gonna start showing up for the costume party any minute.
You can punch snoopy in the stomach as hard as you can and he won't feel it.
Oh, you know this is why you, Brian, remember? the last couple of weeks i kept saying:
Can I have a couple minutes of your time to talk to you about something?
Are-are you just trying to piss me off, or is that really how you say that?
And sometimes babies are put back into the womb just so that they can be aborted again?
I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl who loves abortion as much as you do.
That's not the point, Stewie. I'm just... tired of every girl I meet beeing crazy.
Now, come on, let's forget our problems and get lost in the world of books.
No, I, yeah, I like being away from you, 'cause I can't stand looking at you!
Tell you what, how about I take it and then send it after i read it.
Geez, Brian, you've been going to the mail every day for a week, what are you looking for?
My hat kept blowing away so i put the package on it so i wouldn't loose it.
That's the dumbest think I've ever heard, you don't wear a hat and there's no wind in here.
I won't lie to you, I came this close to praying that I'd see you again.
You know Carolyn, I rarely find myself connected with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your compagny.
Yeah... You knew it was gonna be a touching comedy because Robin Williams had a beard.
'Course I'll tell you what would really set you right is uh... couple of Aleves and a good night's sleep.
You gonna take a ride out in the country and let the AIDS blow through your hair?
Alright, but just one last piece of advice: Remember, listen to her body, and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you.
Well, you never made a move on me so I thought you just wanted to be friends.
She started going on about her new brazilian wax and not wearing any underpants and whatnot.
Now why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something.
You need to stop pointing fingers, and get out of the house, have some fun!
I mean, so what if you forgot your wallet, I'll pay. I'm gonna pay for us.
You tell the best stories. Me and my three eggs are having the best time.
Just... forget her alright? I just want to sit here watch the ball game and have a few beers.
I'll tell you what this would be painful to watch if you love that girl.
Boy what are the odds of running into Cleveland and Carolyn everywhere we went, huh?
You know it's amazing Cleveland, you went from a black woman to a white woman without having to take a hispanic woman step in between.
But I can never go back to Cleveland. Not after all the pain I cause him.
Listen, I just wanna clear any bad feelings you may have about me and Carolyn.
But here comes Loretta all apologetic and wanting to get our family back together and whatnot.
Well, just-just wait a minute you guys, let's not be so quick to demonize Loretta, I mean...
Oh, you just want Cleveland out of the picture, so you can get back with Carolyn.
That-that's not it at all. I-I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful with her sassy wisdom and speedbag arm fat.
I guess at the very least i could go talk to her tomorrow and see how I feel.
But overall, Loretta is a delightful person, very pleasant to be around, and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
You know there might be a way to drive the point home that she hasn't changed.
Well we're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good and that he can't trust her and if he catches you guys in the act
In spite of the fact that your people control a disproportion in amount of the world's wealth.
And in all likelihood are probably responsible for starting every major war since the dawn of t...
We have a club sandwich, a fruit plate and a sight of HOT BEEF STEAK!
I came over here wanting to believe that there was still a chance for us.
But, on the way, i passed a lake, skipped a few rocks and had some black-guy thinking time.
What you and I have was a wonderful thing. and as much as I still have a great deal of love for you, our time is over.
I... I-I-I... I-I would think that would be something you'd check with your doctor about.
You know kids, there's a lot of history here. These 50's diners were very popular in the 80's.
Not like last night when I didn't have time to poop before the guests arrived.
Son of a bitch! Looks like I'm gonna have to pile all dinner on top of... He guys how are you!
Oh yeah Chris. Polio back then was like AIDS today. Except people who have polio get in to heaven.
Oh my God! This is Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen. This is my favorite song of all time.
Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?
Peter will you give this song a rest? You've been playing it ever since we've got home.
Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.
I bought some local TV air time, Lois, and I did a public service announcement of vital importance.
You know there's an issue facing many americans today that I know concerns a great number of us.
According to Gallup polls one in twelve americans is unaware that the bird is the word.
I've for one dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.
Sir! Our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.
I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.
Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.
There's a lot of jews out there still get a laugh of a hello mother, hello father.
Well, a hell with all of you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin' Bird.
No, I'm sorry. A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.
Huh! Well if you're not Jesus Christ, then you won't mind if I pee on this Amy Grant CD's.
Plus the timing seemed good, 'cause my dad just quit smoking and is a little on edge.
You seem like a nice guy. Hey won't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?
Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat we can watch that youtube footage of xx xx calling moviephone.
Oh, all right. So there I was. They just beaten me senseless. Stuck thorns in my head.
Nailed me to the piece of wood. Shoved the spunch full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me.
Then they put me into a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.
We know we gonna puke but Joe says Hey let's go see Chronicles of Riddick
Sat through the whole thing without puking and then I get home wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.
Ah, you know Jesus if I go get myself on, would you mind talking to my friend Mariel Goldman?
All right, I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you really Jesus?
Say listen Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but there's one person I really want you to meet.
The American people may have turned against the war but I answer to a higher power.
You may look like a bum but you've got a lot of talent, young man.
Ah, you don't wanna get back to that record store. You gotta get back out there.
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.
You know you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?
Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.
Look at these idiots, they don't even listening. You know what, we gotta prove it to them.
Listen, I'm gonna go to that supermarket and get some water and you gonna turn it into wine.
Mom, why is it there when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous and when I did, I've got suspended for 5 days.
You know, I owe this all to you Peter. You gave me the confidence I needed.
My face again to Dave Coulier. Season 3 of Full House is out on DVD March 5th.
My next guest died for our sins and now it looks like he's back on the scene.
Oh, you know kinda bumming around, playing a little color duty for even a lot of pinkberry. blah-blah-blah
I raised River Phoenix from the dead then we went out to the Viper Room and he OD'd again. blah-blah-blah
Did you see that? He made Jay Leno laugh. This guy is gonna be huge.
Hey everybody what's up? Dane Cook here in da house. At the MTV Movie Awards. what's up?, what's up?.
Hey you know what I hate? When you eat an ice cream cone and it's all like cold.
And you like Oh, man. But chicks don't do that because they use a spoon.
And now to present the award for sickest on screen gangsta pimp bound  ? parisness
Boy. Who would've thought, me, Peter Griffin, the guy you just two weeks ago drew a smily face on his own testicle to make his son laugh.
Last time I was down here on earth I only hung around with one whore.
This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!
I can't believe Jesus hasn't called me back. I left him a message like 4 hours ago.
If I rang like 6 times that means he didn't hear it but I rang twice Lois.
That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.
Ah... Forgot to tell you, I have a doctor's appointment today, I'm actually there now.
Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconscious.
Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying: Jews are responsible for all the world's wars
Yeah, well, get someone else to bail you out, 'cause it ain't gonna be me.
Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.
I know Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.
I don't know. Maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm a little more mature.
I'm looking for Mort. He came up here an hour ago and never came back down.
He seemed to be in a rush and had a pain look on his face.
And he stepped into that box there and suddenly there was a big flash of light.
Oh my god! Stewie we have to get him back. Where did the machine sent him?
Oh, I'm sorry Brian, is my time machine not as good as your time machine?
All right. We'll go get him. But remember Brian, don't touch anything when we're in the past.
Even stepping on a mosquito could create a chain reaction that drastically alters the present.
Okay. If everything worked properly this should be the exact time and place that Mort was sent to.
Oh no, you can't put you hand back up after you put it down. You know-- Never mind.
And when I've got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out.
There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo, and my great aunt Vera, who didn't like to spend a lot on anything.
But Brian, when am I gonna have another chance to see my grandpa Haim's wedding with my own eyes.
Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top jew.
Yeah, right. How many pollocks does it take to fix the time machine? Let's find out.
No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe from the nazis.
Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful and rub dirt my assneck(?) all over my assy nipples.
All right, there's the checkpoint. If we can get past it, we're out of occupied Poland.
I mean a good guy, 'cause it says in the old book-- Not so old though.
We pray in the name of you and of your son, who died in a freak accident, that you can't really blame on anyone.
Oh boy, you, you are, you, you, you should be glad, your HR person was not around here then.
So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home.
I have british accent, I'm possibly homosexual, I've never brushed my teeth and my wife is grossly(?).
Dear god, this place is nightmarish. Look at the offencive way they draw a jewish people.
It's coming, it's coming. There's some problems, we have much better luck developing this impressive collection of luftballons.
Oh, I almost forgot, I can suppose you boys have some uranium I could borrow?
Okay, here's one. If you were gay and you had to have sex with either
Yeah, but you remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one and then rescues them at the end of the third one?
Yeah, why didn't they just fly the eagle to Mordor instead of spending three movies walking there.
Oh, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm just saying there's hole in the story.
All right guys, the best thing you can do for your body after a massage is hot coffee, alcohol and slim jims.
I've noticed one of my testicles went up inside my body and hasn't come back out yet.
Or... Or... I don't know man, but... but you're lucky you're not doing it over here... in the ocean.
Ah, if you don't like starfish you're gonna be mad about what I just did.
Ah, you're in for it now, buddy. I've got like five fish coming to help.
Why is it every time I open this door you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle you inexplicibly acquired?
I do not want you trying to fly that thing... you're not even a trained astronaut!
Plus I've had a lot of time to rub one out which in space is great, except after a while it's like living in a snow globe.
Peter, instead of wasting your free gas on a series of comedic stunts why don't use it more constructively?
So, if you're cruising along the left side of the road at a 120 km per hour in zis kheavy desert, turn up the decibels
I'm gonna take Brians novel and replace every use of the word and with the word fart. The young soldier fart his brother looked at each other fart both knew that with love fart truth fart courage they would both emerge st-fart-ing on their feet.
No. Peter, Iraq had nothing to do with this, it was bunch of Saudi-Arabians, Lebanese and Egyptians financed by a Saudi-Arabian guy living in Afghanistan and sheltered by Pakistanis.
Wake up, Stewie, let's get you out of that seat and into a fresh diaper.
Now every time I come back to this place it's gonna be associated with one particular bad memory.
Of course how hard could it be? You just unfasten these things and lay back with your legs in the air and let nature do the rest.
And then scroll through the on-screen menu by pushing the arrow-button. Now that we've learned the basics...
Which means I've got to get a job. otherwise we'll be in worse shape than Morbidly Obese Albert.
There was a guy inside selling shower curtain rings, so I bought a bunch of those.
Our baby is at home all by himself yet instead of getting us home you've managed to make things worse at every turn!
If your instinct tells you not to do something, it's probably the right thing to do!
Guys! I found us a ride to Quahog in the back of a truck! Hurry!
C'mon let's head home before Stewie gets hurt like Fozzie Bear when he went to Saudi Arabia.
Eh, he was so arab that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all.
She said she saw you in the back of the kitchen sneaking a fish sandwich.
I promise with all my heart that I'll never say or do anything bad to you for the rest of the evening.
And remember for answers to any questions you may have you can consult the on-screen help menu.
Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville and I'm gonna take a shotgun blast to the face.
I don't know Peter. That scull and crossbones warning before show us pretty clear about not doing that.
Peter, what are you-- What are you boys doing up there? Get off the roof!
You know, Peter, I'd expect this kind of behaviour from you but you have no business endangering Brian like that.
I mean he jumped into that lake to try to save your life and he's 8 years old, Peter.
He's old, Peter. Plus he drinks and smokes all the time so take that 56 and make it 79 at least.
Why you making such a big deal out of this, Lois? I was just a little tired.
He's not the dog he used to be and-- I'll have to get used to it.
Fantastic. And to help us forget about it family, I'd like to introduce-- New Brian.
Hey, gang! Whose leg do you have to hump to get a hug around here?
Well, now you getting old and New Brian's here to take some of the load off.
Well, Meg and Chris, I can't decide which one of your hats I like better.
Hey, you still my buddy. New Brian is just a new friend for the family.
Trust me, you guys are gonna get along better that Abraham Lincoln and his neighbour.
I hope you don't mind. I checked the time your alarm was set for and I shut it off.
Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while, so I've got you a journal.
Actually, I got you two of them: my right ear and my left ear. Fire it away.
Dear diary. Today at the school library I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman with nipples that cover most of her breast too.
Yep. In fact I wrote a new song today and I want to hear what you think of it.
Hey, Brian. I went out for a run this morning and I found this sitck.
And I've got you some of this. I don't smoke it myself but I sure won't judge you.
Well, you know, I wasn't sure about this new dog thing at first but I've gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy.
But it probably couldn't hurt to remind them how much they value you as a family member.
Hey, hey, this song made me think of you, so wa-- listen to this song.
Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of-- ran my course here and you know, besides there's whole big world out there and it's time I saw it.
Well, if your mind is made up about this, Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.
Now that I've got you, let's both revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.
I'm gonna be bringing a puerto-rican girl over here later and she's superhot and real nice but when she was five years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van and it's still kinda messed up in a pretty obvious instantly visible way and uh-- please don't say anything and-- try to make eye contact with her when she waddles in because I want this to work.
I mean she herself is so pretty but-- that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in 'em.
You know, when she's not looking you should take a look at it but but, good god, be discreet.
I mean he's-- he's so damn sweet and saccharine and perfect and he's turnin the family in to the bunch of douches.
I tell you what, when this is all over, I'll make you some pie with a nice dollop of coolwhip.
And sometimes walking out on to a dry plane or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then.
No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights, and we especially don't like the way you humped that chair in the den.
And that is why I killed myself chopped myself up and put myself in the garbage.
And I'm not giving up on my dream like I did with that indoor hot air balloon.
It's a probable twelve to seven that the guy's only doing it for some doll some doll! some doll! the guy's only doing it for some do-o-o-oll
All right now, next up we get the comedy style, it's Kim Li Song, give it up.
So, you ever noticed when two black guys coming into your convinient store and one go one way and one go the other way?
You stay out of my store! All you stay out of my store! I remember your face!
Now, before you say anything, one, it has no human emotions, and two, its prime directive is never to harm people.
Just wait, in a few weeks that club will be the hottest spot in Quahog.
A lot of people says Stacy's no good and she slept with this guy and then that guy, and even this guy.
Well, tell you something, that experience's gonna work in her favor later in the game.
Our management level position has become available and I've seen that you've been working very hard lately.
Holy crap! You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie and it said Obvious lesbian will bring great news
Grrr, this is gonna be the bigger pain in the ass than getting into Last Clap contest with Cleveland.
I know, I know, it's kinda silly but we were-- You know, we were just a bunch of kids.
Omar is our top student and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory next week in the district Spelling Bee.
And by laughing at other people's sexuality somehow I feel better of it at my own.
Give it up, Brian, noone wants to go to a stupid big band club anymore.
You know, I could help you make some changes around here that would bring in customers.
Hi there, my name's Glenn Griffin. Um, I'm here to pick up my son Peter for a ball ga--
Hey, get a load of Meaner J. Cribbs(?) over here he's rubbing the records with his hand.
Yes. And whoever collects the most is gonna win a free weekend here in the chateau with interhational food and wine tastings.
Oh, Lois, I've just had a weirdest dream that Louis Black told jokes that was so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear.
We went to Barney's, I heared that's where all the famous people shop for skinny leg jeans.
You look like rappers but you're not black so that's the perfect 'em out of danger.
He was the only guy on the golf course who had a five iron with the cork on the end of it.
So, who wants to come back to hotel and take a wack at my genitals?
As soon as that guy shows up anyplace, it gets a worse rapped than John Wilkes Booth.
I like to bring transient hookers to the old oak-tree where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I watch them having sex with each other.
Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty. and sentences you to seven days in prison.
God! I can't believe we bought this ridiculous clothes for a club that didn't even last.
Hey, come on, we had a great seventy-two hour run and in this business that's all you can ask for.
On the western side of Quahog if you care to come along there's a club that's so exclusive that a line is ten miles long
Where the douchebags come to party and to spend their fathers cash just to take home slutty women and then wake up with the rash yeah, they wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up with a rash
Take me out to pLace tonight where the ...(?) keep our tight and the guys in hooded sweatshirts have forgotten that they're white
And I'm not giving up on my dream like I did with that indoor hot air balloon.
It's a probable twelve to seven that the guy's only doing it for some doll some doll! some doll! the guy's only doing it for some do-o-o-oll
All right now, next up we get the comedy style, it's Kim Li Song, give it up.
So, you ever noticed when two black guys coming into your convinient store and one go one way and one go the other way?
You stay out of my store! All you stay out of my store! I remember your face!
Now, before you say anything, one, it has no human emotions, and two, its prime directive is never to harm people.
Just wait, in a few weeks that club will be the hottest spot in Quahog.
A lot of people says Stacy's no good and she slept with this guy and then that guy, and even this guy.
Well, tell you something, that experience's gonna work in her favor later in the game.
Our management level position has become available and I've seen that you've been working very hard lately.
Holy crap! You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie and it said Obvious lesbian will bring great news
Grrr, this is gonna be the bigger pain in the ass than getting into Last Clap contest with Cleveland.
I know, I know, it's kinda silly but we were-- You know, we were just a bunch of kids.
Omar is our top student and we're hoping he'll lead us to victory next week in the district Spelling Bee.
And by laughing at other people's sexuality somehow I feel better of it at my own.
Give it up, Brian, noone wants to go to a stupid big band club anymore.
You know, I could help you make some changes around here that would bring in customers.
Hi there, my name's Glenn Griffin. Um, I'm here to pick up my son Peter for a ball ga--
Hey, get a load of Meaner J. Cribbs(?) over here he's rubbing the records with his hand.
Yes. And whoever collects the most is gonna win a free weekend here in the chateau with interhational food and wine tastings.
Oh, Lois, I've just had a weirdest dream that Louis Black told jokes that was so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear.
We went to Barney's, I heared that's where all the famous people shop for skinny leg jeans.
You look like rappers but you're not black so that's the perfect 'em out of danger.
He was the only guy on the golf course who had a five iron with the cork on the end of it.
So, who wants to come back to hotel and take a wack at my genitals?
As soon as that guy shows up anyplace, it gets a worse rapped than John Wilkes Booth.
I like to bring transient hookers to the old oak-tree where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I watch them having sex with each other.
Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty. and sentences you to seven days in prison.
God! I can't believe we bought this ridiculous clothes for a club that didn't even last.
Hey, come on, we had a great seventy-two hour run and in this business that's all you can ask for.
On the western side of Quahog if you care to come along there's a club that's so exclusive that a line is ten miles long
Where the douchebags come to party and to spend their fathers cash just to take home slutty women and then wake up with the rash yeah, they wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up with a rash
Take me out to pLace tonight where the ...(?) keep our tight and the guys in hooded sweatshirts have forgotten that they're white
Guys, I don't think I can make it today. It looks like Bonny might go in to labor any minute so I think I should stick close to home.
Man, I am so sick of this. Joe is just gonna keep bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonny's butt.
We are gonna figure out a way to induce labor and make Bonny have that baby.
You remember when he bailed on us for that trip to spa we had to find another handicapped guy?
I can't look. I didn't look when Lois gave birth and I can't look now.
When we are done selecting our piece of bread we use the tie to preserve...
I gotta tell you. That being able to pay my child hospital bills somehow makes me feel that...
The baby's hospital bill drain dollar savings so I've had no choice but to take this job
Look, I'm a police officer, I can't afford to get mixed with a lawn shark.
Do it, Joe. Cause if you gonna work here any longer, you're gonna feel smaller than my eye floaters.
Would you mind listen to this song I wrote for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think?
What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.
Wow Peter, I got to say this lemonade stand was really a good idea. It's selling really well.
You know... I've never to... I've never told anyone this. but you're so good at cursive.
I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.
Oh yeah! Just what I need. To be rubbed down by big fatty an old black guy, a crippled and a pervert.
It's like a cozy house where you live that's where you start your journey here I am in my house, nice and cozy and then you poke your head out the door with the seacode(?) everything looks ok out here maybe I'll take a walk outside to the decored oh, walking around outside look at all that stuff out here and then we go to an ...(?) getting a little cloudy out here looking like we might have some weather then we go to ...(?) oh, definetly goes some weather things a little more complicated than they seen at first and then we go back to my house
You sound like an unbelieveable douche. then Brian comes in and I change up the tempo
Brian comes in and it changes the song looking at me like he thinks I'm a douchebag but he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong hey Brian, why are you bringing me down there? why are you bringing me down? DON'T BRING ME DOWN!
Wha-What did the boss said? He said something funny and now I drowe the blank, wha-wha-what it was?
All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.
But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt annual Bring all your cash and put it in our safe party.
My father-in-law has treated me like crap for almost 20 years and it's time for a little payback.
I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights stand in a middle of a scene.
Ah, ta-da-ta-da, like this in the back room. What the fuck it is with you?
And by the way, sorry, I ate that last piece of pie you were saving for yourself.
I'm gonna go pee and I wanna walk around some more and I walla scenes going (?).
But you know, dad will find out he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.
Look, my point is you know that you doing this wrong and you know how to make it right.
Peter, I don't think it's wise to have a brain-damaged horse as a house pet.
Kitchen Confidential is in the lead followed by The Wedding Bells followed by The Happy Hour followed by The War at Home followed by Drive followed by The Winner followed by Life on a Stick followed by The Loop followed by Head Cases followed by Standoff followed by Vanished followed by Free Ride followed by Method & Red followed by Tru Calling followed by Quintuplets followed by Stacked followed by Justice followed by North Shore followed by Back to You
It looks like 'Till Death has taken a right turn and is heading into the stand.
Dear god! I could describe the horror I'm witnessing but it is so unfathomable ugly and heartrending that I cannot bring myself to do so.
I know you can't hear any screams but I assure you they're signing frantically just as fast as their little fingers can shape the complicated phonemes necessary to convey dread and terror.
It suffered a fatal heart attack from the exitement when I disposed of it properly.
Oh boy. I miss the old days when it was just a flaming bag of poop and a hurtful note.
This is perfect. Now I want to take off that job as Matt Damon's neck.
Hey, is this another one of those movies where you're an educated Boston street tough?
We're just going to give you a series of experimental injections and record the results.
It will give you the appearance of being funny even though you haven't done anything funny.
All right, mr. Griffin, at this time we're going to inject you with what we believe we've isolatet as... the Gay gene.
Ah, all sorts of things hepatitis vaccine, a couple of steroids the gay gene, calcium, a vitamine b extract.
I assume that's the one you meant even though it wasn't literally the last thing I've said when you said What did you just say?
Peter, I think maybe you should go back and have that doctor undo whatever he did.
Guys, Brent can't fit in the glory hole, and that's why we all like Brent.
I think I'm jelous of miss Eats anything she wants and still fits into size 4 Oh, I could scratch your eyes out. Meow.
You know, Peter, with all the shopping and cooking and decorating. I have to say
For all we know, he could be this way for the rest of his life.
So we're all just gonna have to get used to this and lend to accept your father for who he is now.
Oh, great plan, Lois. Hey, here's a merry idea ever read The Bible? Leviticus 18:22.
My solemate, Lois. I'm here, I'm queer, but don't get used to it 'cause I'm leaving you.
Take the lessons I've thought you and be the best leader of this household you can.
Ah, sure I do, but this is a whole new chapter of my life, Scott.
No, thanks, Rick. Ever since Peter left our house hasn't been getting destroyed by a shenenigans on a weekly basis.
By the time you get out of here you're gonna be back to your old self again.
You're all here because you've made a choice to renounce your evil sinful ways and redeem yourself in the eyes of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ who hates many people but none more than homosexuals.
Peter, we'll start with you. Repeat every word I say exactly as I say it.
Tonight me and my friends Poly and Matty are going out to drink a ton of beers.
Then its straight to the gym for three hours of crunches and extended eye contact with strangers.
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry about you, people but I didn't know where else to go.
I haven't seen Peter in two days and I just thought he might be here.
Well, its just... You seem so unhappy and I just... wanted to help you get your husband back.
Peter, there's nothing I'd want more than have you back but your place is in Scott now.
I mean a person sexual identity is no more a choice than the color of his skin.
Oh god, I feel like I'm kid in the candy store who's having sex with a bunch of gay guys.
Tonight's episode of Family Guy was recently discovered in Peter Griffin's basement, along with a number of other lost episodes.
Uh... I've been working on a new movie and it's really great. Toss me a rope!
What was it like having a privilege of performing the words of Oscar winnier Diablo Cody?
I... envy the tattoo artist who had that huge canvas of arm fat to work with.
Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?
I won this in 1989 from a Honey Nut Cheerios sweepstakes and I totally forgot to cash it in.
You're saying all those guys in their powdered wigs and pilgrim hats and their big gross wives were wrong?
Man, they have to be stupider than you are when you fart yourself a wake.
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.
Oh yeah? Well say that after the soul-searching walk around the town to Dust in the Wind.
Now remember, Peter, we will be right here in the van if anything goes wrong.
Do you think he'd be offended if I ask him to sign this basket ball?
Are you sure you wouldn't like to confess to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?
And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf away from all those people who have demonized me and made me out some kind of bogeyman.
Ten thousand rushing yards, six pro-balls two arrests and no convictions. All it's O.J. Simpson.
Yes, he have a few marital problems but I used to look up to him.
That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson as a boy and you just can't accept the fact that he's not who you thought he was.
Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.
OK, one... two... Oh-oh, hang on, hang on, Brian. Stop the wheel, stop the wheel.
Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise on how to murder a woman and get away with it.
He's got money to buy tongue depressors and yarn but not enough to pay us back?
We don't have footage of the murder itself but we can show you what's happened thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.
I love you, Nicole but I must confess to some trepidation for I am a lonely waiter who loves a loss of a estation (?) opera-style song
Well, it looks like this is one more town the medias run me out of.
Now wait a second, Juice. You can't let them tell you how to live your life.
Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.
This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.
So that way, when I get pulled over for drunk driving I'll look the same as on my license.
And we also want to remind you that FOX News switches to high definition starting Monday.
Good evening everyone and I hope you're as thrilled about the new format change as I am.
We interrupt this report to inform you Rhonda Latimer has been relocated to Guantanamo Bay.
Thats a beautiful shade of lipstick. I bet you enjoy the music of Men at Work.
Wow, what a body, that feels good, I'll give you a call. You'd better get tested.
And even though this Iraqi veteran lost his hands he didn't lose his ability to feel.
Y'know, I've been doing this job a long time, and I think  you've got what it takes.
W-w-well ... y'know I came down here not even thinking I had a shot and now you're telling me this?
Lois, I can't believe you're doing this. If you work for FOX News you're  going to be selling your soul.
Y'know Brian, you're welcome to come with me to see for yourself that it's all on the level.
Chris ... Meg. Meet me in the living room in 10 minutes and bring a pencil and paper.
Meg, now that Lois has connections at FOX, we are gonna invent our own cartoon show.
Ooh ... how about a show about a bunch of disabled ducks and we'll call it Handi-Quacks.
Alright, let's spend many hours on this. Alright, the main duck ... what's his name?
Ha-ha-ha, I love it. I love it. Alright, now what's his wacky neighbour duck's name?
I'll show you to our day care facilities shortly, but first let's have a look around.
This is our control room, where we have the ability to monitor up to 500 different news stories in any given hour.
And this is the kitchen. We've got all kinds of snacks and cold drinks in here.
Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose are trying to build a house of cards and it keeps falling down?
Now. Alright. Let's take a walk down this road and see where it leads us.
Umm ... maybe Poopy Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh .. Boy, this house of cards just doesn't wanna stay up.
Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna go right at it like a neanderthal sure, but I think we're shooting for a little more subtilty here, y'know.
Y'know, I don't believe that. I don't believe that that's a real conversation when I hear it. People don't talk like that, Meg.
Oooh ...oooh! What if they just bought a new wood stove and Red Hynie Monkey says, Boy, it's so hot in here because we just bought that new wood stove
(Both) and we're sweating, and our hands are all slippery and that's why we can't get the card house to stay up.
I mean, we haven't even referenced the fact that they're ducks or that they're handicapped. But the show is called Handi-Quacks.
Alright, Lois, for your first assignment we want you to do an investigative expose on one of America's greatest enemies.
We have reason to suspect that Michael Moore may be a closet homosexual. We need you to get the proof.
Well, if you think that Michael Moore's possible homosexuality is news worthy, I'll do my best to get the story.
Alright, I have come up with a design for Red Hynie Monkey the head of the Handi-Quacks.
People will tune in to Handi-Quacks each week and see that big red bum and get a big laugh out of it.
Good note. Good note. OK, now I also had a thought for a female character who's always nagging at Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not to leave his beer cans lying around and what-not.
Now, see the joke is, most people only carry a suitcase when they're going on vacation.
Your writing partner is out of her mind.  OK first of all stop calling her my parsha.
I just, y'know I just feel that you and I have captured lightning in a bottle with the Handi-Quacks.
And look, there's Rush Limbaugh coming out of Michael Moore's house at 2 in the morning.
What are you talking about? You're the one who sent me to investigate, and now I'm showing you proof and you're dismissing it?
The President has just confirmed a devastating surprise attack by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
Much of our naval fleet has been destroyed and the death toll is believed to be in the thousands.
I just built a space ship. Wanna come up in space with me in it?
You understand? I. am. Colonel. Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon so. I. talk. like. this. with. a. moon. accent. Do that!
So they want me to drop the story completely because they don't want to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They wanted you to do the story when they thought it would embarrass Michael Moore, but they don't want you to do it if it's going to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
But you didn't want me to do the story when it was gonna embarrass Michael Moore.
OK. You're right. I'm a little biased myself but at least I'm willing to admit it.
An oversized Armani suit and an oversized cheap wind breaker tossed casually on the floor.
You realise that the only reason I'm taking this meeting is that your wife is a reporter for our news division?
We take you on a little trolley ride down story lane. You're havin' a good time, enjoying out little tale, think you know what's coming. BOOM!
Left turn! You don't know how it happened. You don't know where you are, but you like it.
You're yukking it up, you're laughing, your sides are hurting. All of a sudden you realise, you're feeling something too.
When did they become like welcome guests in your home whose weekly visits the whole family eagerly awaits?
Our palms are slippery and sweaty because of the heat from that new wood stove we just bought.
Easy. I just walked into the wood stove store and said Put it on my bill.
It's a small change. And if you do it, we'll really get behind this show.
So everybody just gets to stick their big chef's spoon  into my comedy gumbo, eh?
Mr Moore. Mr Limbaugh. Do you have anything to say to FOX News about this ...
Wait a minute! You mean all these years Rush Limbaugh has just been Michael Moore in disguise?
Well, after the Wonder Years I was hungry to do more acting but the pickings were slim so I came up with this scheme to satisfy my need to perform and I guess it got a little out of hand.
This Sunday on FOX, it's the new hit comedy starring America's greatest actor, Fred Savage.
Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight
Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says: I am in command. You are safe with me.
And in conclusion, whether your dreams are earthbound or set in the stars - follow your heart.
I have this itch on the back of my leg. And I can't figure out if it's a bug bite or dry skin?
But remember that the summer months take a particular toll on any region's aquafer, depending on the local climate.
What? You came to a Star Trek convention with the mumps, you could be infecting people with a disease!
Well, it was 1992 and I couldn't be bothered with anything that didn't involved Dan Cortese
Well, I caution you, that getting the mumps as an adult could result a serious complications.
Are you kidding? I always thought those were two little sandbags to keep floodwaters from floating into my bum
Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but your father's bringing in the old TV.  Hey Meg!
Here's your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote and it only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.
Hi, welcome to the Religion channel number one show. Kirk and the Lord just hanging. With me, Kirk Cameron.
If my calculations are correct the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation will soon be here to anwser all my questions!
This is the day that the Lord hath made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
It's that damn religion channel. She was watching it all day while she was bedridden.
I want to share the word of God with everyone I know. Starting with my family.
What? I'm just saying, you should be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton. Hwil Hwheaton seems like a nice guy.
And I think it's important for all of you to hear his inspiring message about the word of God.
You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have faith in but there is such a thing as moderation.
Brian, it's one thing to bash organized religion, but we believe in God in this house,
But not one picture of a guy with a beard sitting around on a cloud.
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now? I'm thinking Shut up and get a salad
Just hang on, alright? There's a lot of us, it, there's a lot of.. It's a big order!
They got my picture up at the drug store and they won't sell me any Sudafed.
I mean the Church makes me feel accepted and safe and part of something bigger that myself.
But Meg, you don't need an outside voice to feel those feelings, they're inside you.
And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.
Local church goer and juniour christian soldier Meg Griffin has identified the atheist as Brian Griffin of Spooner Street
Alright, what's the worst that could happen, this is the twenty first century, people are tolerant.
Ever since Meg told everyone I'm an atheist I'm the most hated person in town.
I try to rent a movie and they threw me out. I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they threw me out.
But the most serious part of it is no bar would serve me a drink!
Well if you ask me me, I think laying off the sauce could do you some good Brian.
Yeah you big silly arse. Just wrap your lips around me and take a big gulp.
I know, I know. Hey, you mind spreading the news around town, say maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam
If there were a God would he put you here on Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?
Would he give you a smoking hot mom like Lois and then have you grow up looking like Peter?
And what kind of God would put you in a house where no one respects or cares about you?
Oh that's all part of the human experience. It's what we're here to find out.
And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.
Now, try to go to sleep, cause we gotta get up in the morning and make movies.
You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with.
Well, but LeVar and I were going to pool ours for the Fuzzy Troll pencil topper
Peter, I want you and the guys to come over to my house right now.
Oh boy, I usually only get this excited when they say the title of the movie in the movie.
I'm telling you these drug dealers represent a Clear and Present Danger to the United States.
Hey, lets take a man- sized poop in his cat box so he thinks there's something really wrong with him.
How 'bout we hide the cat's body and leave that window open and that way, it'll seem like the cat ran away.
Y'know, Peter, it's sorta adding insult to injury raiding Quagmire's fridge for beer after you killed his cat.
He's got shovels in there, and a hand drawn map titled This is where we'll hide the body.
And when we get to the car would you like a donut to sit on?
Ha ha ha. Y'see, I'm part of it. I'm part of it like everyone else.
No, no. Pot is illegal because William Randolph Hearst ran a smear campaign against marijuana in the 1930's to protect his interests in the timber industry because hemp was poised to replace wood as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.
Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test and if I give him some of mine he's gonna know I've been smoking pot so I need some of your urine so I can ...
No, what's sick is making marijuana illegal when it's been proven that it does less damage to you than alcohol.
What happens when a 40 year old woman asks her 41 year old friend to carry her baby?
Brian, when you have to go to these lengths just to get away with smoking pot it's time to make a change.
We, as American adults with free will have the right to use marijuana if we choose to!
If you want to win people over, you can't just drone on like Ben Stein.
# but all you need is a bag of weed to really get a kick #
# because all we need is a bag of weed to make us wanna cheer #
Look Lois, ever since marijuana was legalized   crime has gone down, productivity is up, and ratings forl Dr. Who are through the roof.
And the only way to do that is to start a fear campaign designed to turn people against pot.
I got the idea ... from ... from ... while   from while I was smoking pot.
Y'know, Neil Patrick Harris got the job on How I Met Your Mother 'cos of that movie?
Y'know, I've only seen that show once but I gotta tell ya,  what's really weird to me is why is the voice of the guy from the future, Bob Saget?
Look, daddy, I agree with what you're trying to do, but I just don't think this is gonna work.
Peter, the reason Brian succeeded in his cause is that he spoke with such passion.
That's how I used to lure wayward sailors to their deaths with my Siren song.
Your novel .. is good enough .. to be published .. on it's own .. merits

What was weird, was that she was crying   but the way she was standing over me, made it look like I was crying.
Uh, so, I heard you talking in the hall the other day about how much you liked High School Musical 2, so I burned you the soundtrack.
No, that's impossible, because I've seen that big hairy mud flap arse of yours in the locker room.
Real men have a couple of beers, and then project their inadequacies on their kids.
So I guess you think you woulda been some sort of big shot by my age, huh?
No, I also got an orange peel and a picture of mom eating a turkey leg.
Well, if there's anyone I can trust it's a stranger at the gym holding a dirty needle.
Well, I took him to the gym and the colorful gent there advised me that I put him on steroids.
Alright, if I'm gonna be seen with you we have to do something about that look.
You're really pretty and I hope I get to be with you for a long time.
Yeah. In fact, I'm going to his house for dinner tonight so I can meet his parents.
I just hope dad doesn't embarrass us, like he did when that one legged guy came over.
Well, to answer your question, Connie, apparently I'm married to a man who thinks it's OK to inject an infant with steroids.
Hey, after dinner, you wanna come up to my room and give each other makeovers?
Hey, what are you wearing, so I make sure I don't wear the same thing.
Hey, Chris! C'mon, let's corner the nerds and call them gay and make them show us their penises.
Yeah, I heard about it when I was making that gay nerd spoon with me.
Do you really think I would help you out in any way, after everything you've done to me?
This one is from when you made a plaster cast of my vagina, freshman year.
When we're done with him, he'll be more of an outcast than a seagull at an Adam Sandler movie.

Ah, cool, Mrs G. Thanks for lettin' me stay here the last couple of weeks.
Brian, I'm filling out my RSVP card ... and I don't know whether I should get the salmon or the snausages.
I hate how he pushes his bangs out of his face with every word he says.
Shutup! He's obviously some sort of Superman. I just   I just need to know if he has any shortcomings that'll make me feel better.
You are not even ... You're goin' in there to look ... That's even gayer.
No, no .. it's just .. I .. I mean .. I probably had a lot to drink last night so if I did anything that might have offended you, I'm .. I'm sorry.
No, it's OK, I have a dog so I've had to cut poop out of his fur before.
I love the show. Do you need a gay friend on the show .. a friend on the show?
Hey, you know what? I'm actually on my way to go shoot now if you want, you guys can tag along.
Whatta ya want? I came out to Hollywood, I'm on camera all day and I turned my back on my own kind.
I need to be, like, fine, to be alone, and, like, not even want to date someone and then I know I'll be fine to get into a relationship.
It's OK. They fill the rest with shots of street signs, and fronts of restaurants and old footage from the A Team.
Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I got a little wrecked after dinner and I didn't wanna drive home.
Oh, yeah, I know that guy. His name's Brian Griffin and he definitely boned Lauren last night.
Well, I think it's wonderful that  you're datin' such a classy, well educated girl like Lauren Conra ... ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.
When asked about their sex life, Brian was quoted as saying Oh, yeah, we just do it me style.
Y'know, a lot of these young Hollywood girls carry their little dogs around in their purse.
It was a one night thing. I have no interest in dating one of those shallow idiot celebrities who's only famous for being famous.

Well, be that as it may,  or not be that, I was thinkin'  I could be your wedding singer.
Not like Sting where you can only understand the last 3. ... brand new day ..
They don't use metal because it reacts chemically with the fish eggs and changes their taste.
You could have just complimented the free food, but one upping me is another way to go.
Lauren just finished a fascinating doctoral thesis on sub-orbital propulsion mechanisms that NASA is using for the next generation of space shuttles.
Y'know, I don't mean to be rude, but do you have a more comfortable chair?
Oh, hey, how are you liking my unabridged history of 2nd World War naval tactics in the Pacific theatre?
I'm at the part where they detail the account of Admiral Halsey's victory at Midway.
Well, Halsey was hospitalized with cirrhosis at the outset of the battle so Spruance, who prior to June of 1941, was primarily a desk Admiral was charged with leading the naval fleet at Midway against Japan.
And in fact, was a turning point for the American naval forces in the Pacific.
You don't have to be. You're adorable. Like those calendars that have monkeys in clothes.
Oh, she will, Brian. And she's gonna be upset that your date is so into you.
Ok, ready? I've been reading up on things that sound sexy. Oh, Brian, I can't wait til after dinner
That's it. I mean, I don't know what else I can do. The wedding's tomorrow and she hasn't shown any signs of leaving Derek.
I want you .. no .. I need you with all my heart and soul. And my only regret is that I didn't realize it when we were together.
Alright, party people. Please clear the dance floor for the bride and groom's first dance.
And here to sing a romantic ballad is the one and only Sting. ... fields of gold.
You may have lost Jillian but you can at least be happy that she's happy.
Y'know, Lois has bitchin' lately that I watch too much TV and don't read enough books.
So I went to the library and picked up three books by the greatest author of the last thousand years.
We begin with a little tale called Stand by Me about 4 young boys who went looking for a dead body and instead found ..... themselves. ... and also a dead body.
The year was 1955 and the voice in my head was that of Richard Dreyfuss.
He had sex when he was five and committed his first rape when he was ten.
Sho' nuff, I thought I'd go deef and dumb when I saw me that dead body!
Anything was possible as we set out that day except contracting AIDS because AIDS had not yet been invented by the government in an effort to eradicate the homosexual community.
Even though legend had it, that any kid caught scaling the fence ran the risk of being attacked by the old man's dog. who would charge to the cry of Chopper, sick balls
Now, he said sic 'em, boy, but what I heard was Chopper, talk to disfigured World War 2 veterans who aren't as bitter as they should be.
Thanks for goin' all the way back to the junkyard to get me this wheelchair.
The twisted and mangled body we had come to see was far more disgusting than any of us could ever have imagined.
Joey learned to live without the use of his legs, and even went on to create a wheelchair type rugby game called Don't-feel-sorry-for-us-ball
Unfortunately, about a week ago, he took an overdose of designer drugs at the Viper Room.
And now for a segment we like a little less than the first and the last ...
I've finished the book and Snuggly Jeff is dead and the readers are just gonna love it.
Y'know, something where the reader doesn't have a load in his pants while he's lookin' at it.
Um, Paul, quick question, and feel free to say no, but I couldn't help but notice the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript in your bag, and, I was wondering if I could read it then kill you if I hate it?
Look, Stewie, I've gone as far as I can with Snuggly Jeff, and I .. I wanna write something more serious
You can't just have Snuggly Jeff magically brought back to life by a child's wish.
So, like, they spent a trillion dollars building this mile high space machine and Jake Busey blows it up.
But then this other guy's like: Hey, it just so happens, I built another identical trillion dollar space machine at my own expense, on the other side of the world
Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said: No! You can't go into space because the machine already got blown up by Jake Cock-a-Doody Busey!
Fine. But you're gonna have to go into town and get me some more paper.
If I let you go, you'll just run straight to the police and tell them I kidnapped you and held you hostage and fondled you while you were asleep.
Now, you remember that Stephen King story when the guy went up to the empty hotel and there were those creepy twins and a guy was runnin' around with that axe and a kid talked to his finger?
He was a fat drink of water, the kind of drink of water that y'know your friend got from the bathroom and not from the kitchen. fat one breaks first tonight.
I carve Star Wars figurines outta stone but it's also for not tunneling my way outta here.
Ah, we've only had one conversation but I can tell we're gonna be life long friends.
And since you're black and I'm white that makes it more especial for the audience.
Well, anyway, I'm a pretty corrupt guy so I figured I could sell your figurines and pocket the cash.
Thanks to the Star Wars figurines Andy carved, he landed a cushy job cleanin' the warden's office.
OK, you clean up the warden's office while I go pop out a pine cone.
But I have to imagine it's a foul disease ridden thing that wears too much makeup to cover up the fact that it's a 47 year old fish dog.
A prison is an environment which requires the highest level of discipline ... and that little stunt you pulled today
.. that little stunt you pulled today made a lot of people look very foolish.
Up in a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, under an old oak tree, there's a rock that has no earthly business bein' there.
If it is, pick yourself up some nice cheap pants and good life to you.
Dufresne, you better get your arse out here before here before you make me cut this sentence shor ....
What the warden and his boys didn't realise was that Andy Dufresne had escaped from Shawshank Prison the night before.
Andy Dufresne, the man who crawled through a river of poop and came out clean on the other side.
It's just a stupid made up word so boys like you can sit behind a desk, wear a fancy suit, and feel important.
And I swear to God, you let me out of here, first thing I'm gonna do is kill again.
Walk along the stone wall until you reach the tree, and that's where you'll find the rock.
I dunno, but I ordered him a beer and now it's just sittin' there lookin' lonlier than Alan Rickman's answering machine.
Hello, Alan Rickman. It's Alan Rickman reminding you to move the pork chops from the freezer to the refigerator so they defrost properly.
Wait ... whadda ya ... uh ... uh... hey .. hey ... hey, get outta here!
Now wait a second, Cool Runnings. We learned in school that Miles Chatterbox Musket founded Quahog, after he was saved by the magic clam.
It is a crisp, clear Spring morning, and Griffin Peterson is ridin' to the home of his beloved.
Peterson, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be down at your job, making oblong bricks out of manure and straw?
Well, I'm one of the few guys in this town who isn't dying a slow, painful diarrhoea death.
I was just walkin' off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.
But in another part of London there was a man who was not in such good spirits.
I .. I like to tell stories from my life and let the humour flow organically from everyday situations.
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
And I said, Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong. You need to take out one of the M's.
Y'know, you're gonna be #@%*!@$ dead in 5 seconds if aunt Frieda doesn't throw a pie at somebody!
Hey, coachman. Let's drive on the left side of the road and see if that catches on.
I've seen it, actually, and .. and it's, like,  you don't even want to make fun of it,
Yeah, it's like that one grape in the bunch that never got to be a grape.
What a wonderfully exciting day. I'm young, I'm all dressed up, and I'm on my way to marry the woman I love.
Well, that's something we didn't really think out too well when we started ... but never mind that!!
As a citizen, I'm proud to have you reign over me and the McAfee Fertilizer company.
With Griffin Peterson exiled to the new world and Lady Redbush believing he was dead,
Our love is like two figs hanging from a fig tree, cradled by Cupid's own hand.
Well, at least it wasn't one of those promos where they've got the whole cast shoving each other playfully,  like they're all good pals.
Meanwhile, Griffin Peterson and the other exiles passed the time on the ship to the new world.
I got caught pleasuring myself to a painstakingly etched engraving of the wife of Bath.
And I mean white white, so no Italians, no Polish. Just people from Ireland, England, and Scotland.
So, listen. You and I need to have a conversation about you not bearing me a son.
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired, and I've had so much work, and I think .. I think I wanted to the other day but I couldn't find you. So, y'know, it's like both of  us on our schedules, y'know?
Y'know, I gotta say, I'm a little mad at you for not bein' more available.
Griffin Peterson and the other colonists worked day and night to build their new settlement, until finally, after much hard work, the colony of Quahog was complete.
It didn't take long before Quahog was a thriving new world settlement, bustling with life.
Time had helped Griffin forget Lady Redbush, and soon he found himself a hearty new wife.
I don't know what to do, jester. I can't be married to the King anymore.
I was ordered to keep silent by the King, under threat of execution but .. you're gonna see this anyway.
We'll hitch a ride on one of the slave ships tomorrow night, after an all new Shovin' Buddies.
And the timin' was good, because  his new wife was a pain in him arse.
.. and then I finished scrubbing the kettle but .. then I saw that I'd missed a spot and, oh .. I was so worried that the whole thing wasn't clean enough so I went back and started washing it again, and sure enough ...
Of course, Griffin had to go through the complex, extensive divorce procedure required by 18th century society.
Well, I mean, sometimes we .. we..  we sleep .. we.. we go to different .. er, we go to bed at.. at different times. We've both been so busy ... it's been .. rediculous! I .. I thought she was takin' a class or something.
Months rolled by, and Griffin and Lady Redbush continued to flourish happily in the colony of Quahog, completely unaware that King Stewart was on the march.
I want you to turn this  settlement upside down until you find Lady Redbush and Griffin Peterson.
Little wrong in the head, I am, from eatin' some bad sausages. Yes, bad sausages that I eat, indeed, sir.
All those months I was without you, I never stopped seein' your face in the back of my wife's head.
Alright, your Majesty. If you wanna leave with your pal in one piece, I suggest you throw down your weapons.
Hear ye! Hear ye! This talent competition will decide rightful possession of the good Lady Redbush and control of the colony of Quahog.
I remember once, she wrote a letter to my uncle Tom from whom she'd been divorced for several years.
And I said, Frieda, you've spelled Tom's name wrong. You need to take out one of the M's.
We got Stumpy Shamus on the lead guitar and he's gonna give you a great big ...
Well, I've got one of my own. I can use it to send you back.
Here in this great hall of justice are the most powerful forces of good ever assembled.
Those swimsuit issues don't excite me like they used to. I've been spoiled by internet porn.
No I don't use the damn internet!  I thought that was for nerds! Why didn't you guys tell me!
You know, Horace still has one of those old beer promotional cutouts of her from like
Hey, you mean this thing? I was about to throw it out. If anyone wants it, it's theirs.
You know... Lois won't be home from groceries for a while. I have an idea.
What the hell is going on? I sent you to pick up dinner an hour ago!
I know I been able to keep this a secret.   But Kathy and I are not actually working on a project together. We're... in love
Ugh, this is stupidest thing  he's done since he got in that turf war with that cat.
Now kids, you don't have to  call her mom right away, but I do want you guys to get along.
Oh, hello Lois... I would've thought  you would've moved in with your mother by now.
There you are! Oh, don't give me that look. You don't think I know where you been?
Peter, settle down. Yes I forgive you, just as  long as you are done with that stupid cutout.
I just want you to know that everytime I was with her, I was thinking of you.
Oh, Lois, I've missed you! You and your wonderful smile and your beautiful eyes and your awesome third boob that's on top of the other boob.
Peter, stop that! We're not having sex! I just told you I have a lump!
Now Mrs. Griffin, although you are in the clear for the moment, we need to have a look at your family medical history to determine your future risk.
When we were married, Your father made me conceal the fact so he can get into country clubs.
Well, this kinda rocks my world., even more than the time When I went to that pediatrician.
Look, this is my way of letting you know that I'm embracing who you are.
Look, Peter, I am the one  with the Jewish heritage, and I really don't want to make a big deal out of this.
Now listen up, I like the hat and I like the scarf, so we are doing this.
As we approach the passover holiday, let us remember the struggle of our people as they labored under the yoke of Pharaoh's despotic rule.
One of the best part about being Jewish is getting to take advantage of their excellent schools
Oh... yeah... No I was... I wasn't sure that everybody had umm ... had heard
And instead of lasting for one day, the oil in the lamp lasted for eight days,
Yeah yeah yeah, how long before we play Pin the eviction notice on the black guy's door.
Yeah I have a question. What are you gonna do when Jesus comes back and puts a boot up your ass?
You know what else? I picked out a sexy  little Jewish outfit for you at the store
Oh my God Lois, if you put on this long, thick dress right now I will lose it.
Oh, I swear to God, Lois. I swear to God that I would lose it.
Oh wait, dad, before you to go, can you say: Peter, you must go to the Degobah System?
Lois, last night my father came to me and reminded me that I am a good Catholic
If I don't rid the house of this Jewish curse, This family is gonna go to hell!
Ah, come on. You're acting crazy, like when you were going through your Parker Lewis phase
Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose. Don't even try and make him lose, because it's just gonna be that much more embarrassing for you
I just had to get out of that house, Peter is being such a jackass
Lois, what Peter is doing to you is exactly what Carter did to me for years
But Mom, I don't really care about being Jewish,  or even Christian for that matter!
All I'm saying is I let your father take my Jewish identity and I regreted it ever since.
But don't drag the rest of us down with you  like a mentally handicapped rooster.
This is my first time doing a Seder which is where we tell the story of the Jews escaped from bondage in Egypt
Doesn't it seems like every Jewish holiday has to do with them escaping from stuff?
Uhh... Lois, not that I'm rushing you, but when do we get to the wine drinking?
Hang on! Hang on! Before do anything I like to say a blessing over the candles, if I may.
Alright, I'm gonna go lie down, then I'm  gonna come back and mess up your Seder
The most important thing is to treat other people the same way you would want to be treated.
Almost all of 'em. Boy, I sure would love it if you guys would come
And discover his identity is by saying the phrase, gosh, that italian family at the next table sure is quiet.
The joke, of course, being that one wouldn't generally do that were there a pillow available.
Great, and as a bonus, I'll throw in what dreams may come with robin Williams.
Maybe far away or maybe real nearby he may be pouring her coffee she may be straightening his tie.
Not while my scrotum is pressed up against my stomach in these jeans, they won't.
The only message in that movie is that every problem in life can be solved by kicking.
Road hou... Roa... Road... road hou... Roa... Roa... road hou... Road hou... Road... roa... Road... road house.
Oh, yeah ? I think my scary, otherworldly, shadowy, spirit friends might have something to say about that.
I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer to think of it as a happy accident. Is she ready ?
No ! I... I mean, I mean, I wasn't gonna use that on your daughter.
I mean, I-i-I would, if I was having sex with her, which obviously, I would not do.
But If I mean... I'm safe and all, I get an aids test once every three months.
Come to think of it, how did this get in my wallet in the first place ? Dear Brian, somewhere between the point when you're excited enough to want it and too excited to care, think about your future.
Gosh, you've been seeing this Rita for weeks now, and you still haven't brought her over to the house.
No, it just seems like some of your past girlfriends have been a little dumb and trampy.
First of all, that's not true, and second of all, she's not like that. She's wonderful, she's smart, she's pretty.
The only reason I haven't brought her around is that you guys don't always make the best impression with girls I date.
Well, actually, I really thought I was going to be an actor at one point.
What do you say we go back to my place and I'll show it to you ?
Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang.
We've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after their release, and even corresponded with them in prison.
I'm looking at her now ! I can see her from the window up here !
Okay, you know what ? I'll bring her to dinner, and you can see for yourself what a bright, fun, and charming woman she is.
You know what we haven't done for a while ? Go around the table, and everybody says what year they were born.
Boy, speaking of that, I don't know how many people have asked me today where I was when Martin Luther King was shot.
Say, Brian, on her answering machine, how long after her message is the beep ?
Nobody bats an eye if a woman dates an older man, but god forbid it's the other way around !
So, what are you doing this afternoon ? Oh, I'm just sorting out my pills for the week, sweetie. well, you do that, and I'll be over a little later.
Oh, I've never noticed this picture before. Is that you when you were a little girl ?
It says, Murray Hill, four, one, eight, five. that's not enough numbers ! That's the number, Brian !
Boy, you know, Brian, a woman her age comes in here, they don't always leave.
Listen, Brian, you say the word and I'll go in there with a pillow and you won't have any more problems.
How many times do I have to tell you, I'm sticking by this woman ?
You see, these past few weeks I've been doubting whether we're compatible, you know, because of the age difference. But I realized that that doesn't matter.
That what-what I get from you is what I always wanted : a smart, sexy, real person who I can talk with and share every piece of me with.
I had a moment of weakness today, but in a way, it's all right because it's taken me to a place where I now realize that you're not too old for me.
You can rationalize it any way you want, but to me, all that shows is that you're an immature guy who doesn't realize what a catch I am.
Wow, the best of the world's wildest police chases. and it even has the one with the Flintstones !
At this point, the dinosaur in the back seat Pokes his head up through the roof
So far the only station that comes in is some british guys reading news from places I'm not sure exist.
Today, in Kuzikistan, a peaceful demonstration turned to bloodshed as members of the turzirly tribe flooded Kenpao square in remembrance of the third anniversary of the Hormsburg massacre.
But finally, some good news out of neighboring Kanduzi, as locals there have reached an uneasy alliance with the bordering Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal.
You know, dad, I saw that movie White Noise, and they said you can use empty radio static to talk to dead people.
My schedule's been so packed. I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass stuff.
Would you like to meet him ? Would you like to meet bitch Stewie ?
I'm just making sure Stewie is nice and clean for his trip to the playground this afternoon.
We had a little bit of a problem earlier because bitch Stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he ?
This is really weird. I mean, it's... one thing to have him help you out with a busy schedule.
And what a lot of people don't know is that I was Jane Wyman's first.
But only after you've played with them and only if you say it's okay !
Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail.
Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail and run your fingers along the length of your tail.
This is a completely nonsexual thing I am asking you to do in a completely nonsexual way.
Squeeze the base of the tail lightly with your thumb and index finger and then, while continuing to squeeze, run them up the length of your tail to the tip and I'll make you a clone.
Yeah, I named her Anna lee, but I'm probably going to call her Annal for short.
It's true. I never mentioned this because I don't want him to feel bad, but after he was born, they had to rearrange most of my organs.
Okay, now I want to qualify this by reminding you, as with my clone, the intelligence level is reduced a bit.
Yeah, well, I might have dialed yours back a little more than I ought to have.
I didn't really want to do the work, so bitch Stewie sort of did it.
I've never had sex before and I probably wouldn't have been much good at it.
Hey, there's another note. Glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom, jer...
So, it's just not working out, me being a father and that's why I'm wondering if you and Lois would be willing to adopt the baby.
Brian, I didn't know if you wanted a god's eye, but I made you one.
He took my dry cleaning and I have no idea what he did with the ticket.
Hey, there's another note. glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom, jer...

If anyone finds this, tell my family I love them. ...Of being on a frozen mountaintop!
I just think she's a one-of-a-kind spirit, and I don't want to see her go
down the wrong... What the hell are you doing going through my personal stuff ?
She's fascinated by things that are going in my life, and... Fine, I googled myself, okay ? You got me. But check this out.
I am sick as hell of you constantly making a mess of this house and having to clean up after you.
And what about the Petercopter ? Did we not have money for the Petercopter ?
They loved the book so much, they want to give me their most prestigious award.
Are they having an awards ceremony for how well you did the dishes last night ?
So, how long have you been a member of the Rhode Island Society For Special Literary Excellence ?
Why don't you shut your *** mouth for once and go home *** *** and your wife in the face !
I swear to god, it sounded like somebody had an accident and maybe somebody got hurt.
He's all I got, 'cause I'm a young street tough, and my parents ain't so good to me.
Sittin'there with a smile on his face, listenin'to me talk about how daddy beats me something fierce.
Listen, I don't want to point fingers but I'm missing about a thousand dollars in play money.
Hey, Brian, you want to see what I drew in arts and crafts at day care ?
Well, I've killed seven, but the point is, you might feel better if you just confess to what you've done.
Then I buried the body and even went out of my way to cover up the evidence.
I know, and that's why I'm prepared for you to arrest me and take me to jail where I belong.
I just couldn't take the stress anymore. I had to come clean. I mean, the truth is, I didn't even stop to find out if he had an owner. I just completely...
If I ever get molested or raped, this is the place I'm gonna think of to make everything all right.
I just can't believe our society actually values the life of a dog less than that of a human. It's infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark at a tree and chew on your balls for an hour.
Look at that dog over there. You think he wants to be tied to that chair, waiting in the hot sun while his owner gets ice cream ?
Hell, no ! I am gonna make people see that an animal's life is just as important as a human's !
Our first meeting is tomorrow night, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys would come and show your support.
Somebody better have something to say to me pretty damn soon, or I'm gonna have something to say to them !
I couldn't agree more. Just let me see if Mikey sells those things with batteries or what the situation is there.
Good evening, everyone. I want to thank you all for joining me at this very important event.
We kill them for food, we humiliate them as pets, and we use them for medical and cosmetic research.
Okay, Barney, I'm going to work now but I'm gonna leave NPR on for you.
Now underneath each one of your chairs you'll find a pamphlet with a simple list of animal rights do's and don't's.
Do you know that in some asian countries they actually cook and eat dogs ?
You know what, you know what ? This is driving me crazy. I wanna eat a dog now.
Wait a second. Just to prove a point to me, you burned down a liquor store and murdered a dog ?!
Hi, we here at Family Guy want you to know that we respect all living beings and assure you that no animals were harmed in the making of this episode.
I just think she's a one-of-a-kind spirit, and I don't want to see her go

I just can't believe our society actually values the life of a dog less than that of a human. It's infuriating.
Maybe you should go bark at a tree and chew on your balls for an hour.
Look at that dog over there. You think he wants to be tied to that chair, waiting in the hot sun while his owner gets ice cream ?
Hell, no ! I am gonna make people see that an animal's life is just as important as a human's !
Our first meeting is tomorrow night, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys would come and show your support.
Somebody better have something to say to me pretty damn soon, or I'm gonna have something to say to them !
I couldn't agree more. Just let me see if Mikey sells those things with batteries or what the situation is there.
Good evening, everyone. I want to thank you all for joining me at this very important event.
We kill them for food, we humiliate them as pets, and we use them for medical and cosmetic research.
Okay, Barney, I'm going to work now but I'm gonna leave NPR on for you.
Now underneath each one of your chairs you'll find a pamphlet with a simple list of animal rights do's and don't's.
Do you know that in some asian countries they actually cook and eat dogs ?
You know what, you know what ? This is driving me crazy. I wanna eat a dog now.
Wait a second. Just to prove a point to me, you burned down a liquor store and murdered a dog ?!
Hi, we here at Family Guy want you to know that we respect all living beings and assure you that no animals were harmed in the making of this episode.
Eaten by sharks while snorkeling Stabbed to death in a toys r us bathroom. ...1940s roller skate left in the hall.
It sure was nice of you to invite us out on your yacht, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
- Why would you do that ?  'cause I'm your pal and I want to help. Like cheeseburger helper.
How would you like to take a half a pound of hamburger and make a delicious meal for the whole family ?
How would you like to take a half pound of hamburger and make a delicious meal for the whole family...
He's never gonna be quite in step with the rest of us and this is sort of my way of taking care of him.
Well, that's nice of you, but it was so much simpler when it was just you and me doing our thing.
Come on, you just gotta relax and cut loose, like those foreign guys over there.
Except for the fact we gotta sit next to that woman who came with her co-workers.
How are you gonna play by the rules if you don't have the rule boo-- Oh...
What if he's in a coma for, like, 20 years and he comes out of the coma and you guys are all dead.
But I'm still alive and I'm a famous race car driver, and he's like aw, man, Stewie turned out awesome.
And he comes to one of my races and I'm so surprised to see him there, I crash.
And then I'm in a coma for 20 years, and I wake up and he's a race car driver.
If you're watching this one it means the train wasn't able to push the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour and I'm still stuck in 1885.
Pewterschmidt Industrie's pharmaceutical division is up over 30%, profits in new media have doubled each quarter over the past year and our stock is at an all-time high.
Now, I want you all to lay some business talk on me. I need ideas.
I'm gonna toss a ball to one of you, and whoever catches it, throw out the first idea you got then pass the ball to the next guy. He throws out an idea and so on.
What happened to the free-loving Quagmire who was banging ten chicks at a time ?
That fart I have at 3 : 00, can you push that up to now ?
You've been treating me like crap For 20 years, Mr. Pewterschmidt, and now I'm the one in charge. Hang on a second.
I command you to have a viewing party for tonight's episode of the big bang theory.
Hi. I was gonna catch the big bang theory tonight and wondered if you wanted to come over and watch.
Carter, as your boss, I'm ordering you to pay a compliment to this sharply-dressed asian man.
And then he made me clean out the fridge in the employee lounge, and the employees were mad at me because I threw out food that they still wanted.
It's just, apparently, somebody flushed a baby swamp monster down the toilet somewhere, not far from here.
Quick, Peter, sign this legal document giving the company back to daddy so you won't get eaten !
And if you don't mind, I'll address you in my natural speaking voice, as I've grown so weary of doing an american accent.
Well, I'm sorry you lost the company, Peter, but I think it's for the best.
Hey, you kids stay out of that cave ! You don't know what's in there !
Kinda like when they build a new bridge next to the old bridge, and you're like,
I haven't heard that much applause since Bob Crane premiered his home movies in my closet.
Okay, name something you find in your bathroom. a razor blade and a note ?
So I'm gonna go with the flute that Captain Picard played, first in his imagination and then in real life, in the episode
I just wanted to make sure the meeting is still on for 2 : 30 tomorrow.
Otherwise I gotta go to that Chinese dentist. Get it ? 2 : 30 ?
Oh, I'm sorry. Your time is up, and you didn't score enough points. But thank you for playing.
All right, Peter, we're going to try to jog your memory with some old videotapes of the family.
Oh, my God, we gotta watch this. Look what they're saying about it. As funny as it is touching !, Gene Shalit. I stood up and cheered. Go, Julia, go !, Joel Siegel. This movie made me laugh so hard I had mild headaches.
I want to show you one of the most special times of your life and mine : our honeymoon.
Here, play Grand Theft Auto for eight hours, and then we'll give it another try.
So, you guys are my best friends, and this is where we hang out ?
Well, we usually come here, you buy us drinks and tell us what Lois's nipples look like, like you always do.
Yeah, but first, you usually go over there and pull down that blonde waitress's top.
Morning nice people who I still don't know your names and who mean nothing to me.
And if sex with the rest of you is half as good as it was with her, then I think we're all gonna get along just fine.
Geez, you open your mouth for a joke once, and that's what you come up with ?
Get out of the kitchen ! Go on ! Get out ! Out ! Out ! Out !
Your father doesn't remember his life, and he doesn't want us to be a part of it, so we've just got to move on.
A baby doesn't belong in the inner city any more than a baby belongs on a plane.
Well, I'm a bachelor, so I invited a bunch of people over, and now I'm waiting for them to leave. That's what bachelors do.
Don't point at her. Don't point. She's looking. Oh, great. Now I got to go in.
I don't know what I was doing before, but this is the way man was meant to live.
I almost don't want to ask you out because I know you're gonna say no. You want to go out ? No ? Okay.
Gosh, you know, I was just picking up a couple hams to take down to the shelter and here I run into you, buying food to make dinner for your husband.
Crap, we're out of milk. I'm gonna run next door to the airport and get some.
Well, when a fella's been alone as long as I have, he learns to take care of himself.
Well, you're a very sweet friend, and you're so good to listen to my troubles.
Boy, you know, I don't know how a half a glass of wine got me so lightheaded.
All right, Peter, now I know your head is still a blank slate, but you got to listen to me when I say... Wait.
Look, fella, I don't know who you are and I don't want to, so why don't you just go back to your crabgrass ?
Well, I figured I could enjoy the bachelor life for a few more days before getting Lois back.
I can't believe we're doing this, but I got to say, it feels kind of right.
I know, it's so weird, right ? I mean, it's... I mean, it's, like, fast.
But if Peter's never coming back to me, it's at least nice to know I'm in the arms of a trusted friend.
I got my memory back, and I love you, Lois. I want you and the kids back.
I treated you so badly, but I hope you know it was only because I wasn't myself.
Hey, you kids stay out of that cave ! You don't know what's in there !

In anticipation of this event, we put together a clip package featuring some of billy's work for channel 5 News. I'm still hungry. said the very hungry caterpillar. But you've already...
But what you shouldn't miss is the quahog rodeo, coming to the civic center this Friday.
And for those of you who are handy with a horse, entry spots are still open.
I fling the door wide open and I say, Peter griffin here. What do you got ?
And if that don't convince you, look at this. In this week's TV guide, it says, Peter gets more than he bargained for when he joins the rodeo.
Well, he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma and the law just could not seem to track him down and it served his legend well for the folks, they loved to tell about when billy the kid came to town.
Apparently she got on the bull to miscarry, and found out she had a talent for it.
Ladies and gentlemen, give an indifferent east coast welcome to the newest bull rider, Peter the Kid !
Well, we're looking for someone to write a piece on the everyday activities of the average american teenage girl.
Maybe you call a few days in advance to give me time to get the house clean.
Maybe you bring a blazer, so we can go to a wider range of restaurants.
I like how all the food and drink is included in the price of the ticket.
Okay, I was just looking for a friend of mine, so maybe I'll see you later.
You know, just because you're writing a profile on teenage girls, it doesn't mean you have to be a creepy stalker and follow Meg around all day.
Where the hell is she going ? There's nothing out in this part of town.
If it takes 10 years or 20 years, I will be here when you get out.
Your mother's right, Meg. You got to be careful who you get involved with romantically.
Well, Angela, if I'm really the only guy at work who can solve it, I'll be right there.
Actually, there was a riot in the prison yard, and I slipped over the fence.
Sunday, Sunday... Here it is. Peter gets more than he bargains for When he joins the rodeo. Boy, did I. And Meg dates a prison escapee !
I forgot to tell you how much I like the rearrangement you and bonnie did with your living room furniture.
Second of all, come outside ! There's an escaped convict running across the street !
Already ? It seems like just yesterday we rented her room to that fly that wants to leave, but can't figure it out.
She's probably a little fragile after being in there so long, and I'm sure she'll be heartened to see our faces.
Well, I don't like to toot my own horn, but I believe I hold the distinction...
I'm a woman in a lab coat wearing goggles, staring intently at a beaker that I'm holding near my face.
I'm a latino in a hardhat, but I'm also wearing a tie so you know I'm a supervisor.
We're college students listening to our professor, but the class is taking place... outside ?!
What'd you do, carve a gun out of soap and then not wash with it ? Ha-ha ! P.U.
Look at Meg. They took an innocent little girl and turned her into a psychotic, sociopathic freak.
What... was it ? What'd you say, Lois ? Something about Meg being a freak ?
You're gonna help me get some money so I can get out of this town.
The one he's expecting to see when he steps out of that prison in 40 years ?
Look, if you don't put the gun down, I'm gonna be forced to call the police.
This isn't a library, you know. And in the face of every adolescent challenge, she looks at the world through hopeful eyes and maintains an uncommon resilience that can only be admired. In this sense, Meg Griffin is not the typical american girl. She is far sweeter and kinder than that.
I was just so tired of being everyone's whipping girl that it felt kind of good to do some of the whipping.

Yes, and to add insult to injury, I shall present to you my fanny :
I came to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
First, it was Henry David Thoreau. But do you know who Thornton Mellon is ?
So you know, you got only yourself to blame next time you go to the vet sand complain that that Indian doctor is too rough with your cat.
I'm gonna finally open up to Ellen from my math class and tell her how much I like her.
Our top story : The search for two local boys lost in the woods drags on into its third day.
We're still very optimistic that we're gonna find these kids, and we just want to urge everyone not to give up hope.
We are officially looking for corpses, so let's get back out there, bring back those dead bodies.
I feel like I can't just sit here doing nothing, but I don't know what I can do.
You know, Mom, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about psychics who help find people who are lost.
I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about this fat woman who sat on her dog and it went up inside her guts.
What do you say for celebration we go dunk our whistles in the trough ?
Hey, check it out. Chris and Stewie, you're on the front page of the paper.
Gentlemen, these are all important fundamental rights, but I move we strike the right to bob for small fish with your butt in the air.
That's the way the state of Rhode Island would put it. There's something... up with her, isn't there ?
And I was wondering if maybe... you want to go out on a date with me.
Because, if the circumstances were such, as you have described them, but with me in them, that's a very different and scary outcome for those involved.
Estelle, and she told me that Stewie is gonna grow up to be very successful.
She gives me the confidence to live my life knowing I'm making the right choices.
Slow down ! I want to get there, but I want to get there alive !
Because, Meg, Estelle told me that someone in the family was in danger of drowning, and that I should take some steps to prevent it.
I mean, I want to impress her, but what if I mess things up ?
All right, look, Lois, this psychic nonsense has gone too far, so I'm going to prove to you that there is no such thing as someone who is psychic, and that with the most minimal training and the right set of buzzwords, anyone can appear to be psychic.
Just by asking very general questions that would apply to most people, a person can appear to have inside knowledge about you.
Clear your mind, remove all traces of unease and doubt, and I will tell you your future.
Ma'am, did you have a female relative who's passed on to the other side named,
{and }she wants to know if this rash looks like it's going to go away.
We just got word of a kidnap victim buried alive with a bomb strapped to his chest.
We need your psychic powers to lead us to him before the bomb goes off.
All right, I mean, it's one thing to take money from a bunch of suckers,
I need somebody to make me an ice cream sundae, so get in the house.
You know, if you want access to this temple, you better pay the proper tribute.
You know, I used to hear that people with down's syndrome were different than the rest of us, but you're not.
No, you didn't. You made a vow that you were going to ask Ellen out, and you did. That took courage, my friend.
Okay, Joe, when I'm tracking someone, it often helps to touch something that belongs to the victim. Does he have a wife ?
Okay. Like a... like a young 12 or, like, a she eats a lot of milk products so she got her boobs early 12 ? Which is a real thing, by the way.
I shall now channel the ghost of Lou Costello, who will guide us to this soul in distress.
Yes, and to add insult to injury, I shall present to you my fanny :

Mom, dad, is it okay if I invite my new boyfriend over for dinner tonight ?
Meg, if you're telling us the truth, I just hope to God he's an improvement over the last one.
I can honestly say for the first time that I am attracted to our daughter.
Has anybody ever told you you're pretty enough to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin ?
Once you get those pants off, It's like two sagging pressed hams and a slice of pizza.
Sorry, all the boys can go home. We only have one part left for a little girl.
Well, I guess sometimes you're just right for the part, like James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader.
It's just that, lately, Peter's been making me feel so crappy about my age, and...
I was, like, is he gonna fall for this And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it 'cause you know, it'll be funnier.
We both know I touched it. Now if you'd like to keep that just between us,
It doesn't mean we have to be stuck in the 19th century with our value system.
You know, we've enjoyed having you around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
The other day you said I was attractive. Now, what are we gonna do about it ?
I will keep up this charahhd as it's pronounced, Brian, as long as I see fit.
I mean, I need all the help I can get, but you have such a youthful look, you could pass for 11 months.
Gotta hide it for the cameras. Instead of tucking it, I just push it in like a button and put a band-aid over it.
Why are you so cruel to me ? Is it because I'm the pretty one ?
Sick of me ?! Oh, that's rich. You know, I wasn't going to say this, but mother hates you.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went to Edaville Railroad, and you cried because you were afraid because one of Santa's elves was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore, and he left that very night and all you cared about was ice cream on the way home and mother said you didn't appreciate anything !
I wanted to see if you could come over to my house tonight and run lines with me.
And why should I do you any favors after the terrible things you said to me earlier ?
At least I didn't bring up that time at Brigham's when you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair !
It was an awful thing that I did. I never meant to steal him from you.
He hangs me from the shower rod with your old bras, and then we laugh at you.
You've made me feel so unattractive lately that I went and did something disgusting and abhorrent and I'm ashamed of myself.
You made out with Meg's boyfriend ? How the hell could you do that to me ?
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down, you wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me and run off looking for another fella.
You see, I didn't move to Jolly Farm from the big city to be around animals.
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister, and my parents wanted her to start a new life.
But my sister Mary shot herself in the face, and that's when I decided that she would live on through me.
And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it
Around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
Mom, dad, is it okay if I invite my new boyfriend over for dinner tonight ?
Meg, if you're telling us the truth, I just hope to God he's an improvement over the last one.
I can honestly say for the first time that I am attracted to our daughter.
Has anybody ever told you you're pretty enough to be a movie star, Mrs. Griffin ?
Once you get those pants off, It's like two sagging pressed hams and a slice of pizza.
Sorry, all the boys can go home. We only have one part left for a little girl.
Well, I guess sometimes you're just right for the part, like James Earl Jones playing Darth Vader.
It's just that, lately, Peter's been making me feel so crappy about my age, and...
I was, like, is he gonna fall for this And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it 'cause you know, it'll be funnier.
We both know I touched it. Now if you'd like to keep that just between us,
It doesn't mean we have to be stuck in the 19th century with our value system.
You know, we've enjoyed having you around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
The other day you said I was attractive. Now, what are we gonna do about it ?
I will keep up this charahhd as it's pronounced, Brian, as long as I see fit.
I mean, I need all the help I can get, but you have such a youthful look, you could pass for 11 months.
Gotta hide it for the cameras. Instead of tucking it, I just push it in like a button and put a band-aid over it.
Why are you so cruel to me ? Is it because I'm the pretty one ?
Sick of me ?! Oh, that's rich. You know, I wasn't going to say this, but mother hates you.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went to Edaville Railroad, and you cried because you were afraid because one of Santa's elves was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore, and he left that very night and all you cared about was ice cream on the way home and mother said you didn't appreciate anything !
I wanted to see if you could come over to my house tonight and run lines with me.
And why should I do you any favors after the terrible things you said to me earlier ?
At least I didn't bring up that time at Brigham's when you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair !
It was an awful thing that I did. I never meant to steal him from you.
He hangs me from the shower rod with your old bras, and then we laugh at you.
You've made me feel so unattractive lately that I went and did something disgusting and abhorrent and I'm ashamed of myself.
You made out with Meg's boyfriend ? How the hell could you do that to me ?
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down, you wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me and run off looking for another fella.
You see, I didn't move to Jolly Farm from the big city to be around animals.
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister, and my parents wanted her to start a new life.
But my sister Mary shot herself in the face, and that's when I decided that she would live on through me.
Now look at your hand. It's just a nub, 'cause I'm gonna cut off all the fingers.
This is my rassinfrackin' land, and I don't care what no man from no Tennessee valley authority says, consarnit !
Look, I'm sorry, I can't help you. what? You too big and famous to walk over to that corner drugstore and pick up a pen and paper and possibly some other groceries I need and come back and sign several things for me ?
I sent that in and they put it on TV, which makes me a famous journalist.
And I got a hundred bucks for it, which I used to buy this $4, 000 video camera.
From now on I'm gonna be right where the action is, like my uncle the guy in the white hat Griffin.
How come your feet are so small ? Is it true you can't say spaghetti?
Tom, who were you having dinner ? Was it a guy ? Are you gay ?
And here I was going to use the money to take you to Can-Cun this winter.
My chemistry teacher, Mr Taylor, rubbed my shoulders for 35 minutes in class the one day I didn't wear a bra.
Why is there a dusty gas station and a diet Pepsi machine in your office ?
'cause your car broke down, and you need to wipe a cold soda on your neck to cool off.
And she wants me to come over to her house tonight to work on a special project.
I know she's gonna make me have sex with her. What the hell am I gonna do ?
I don't know, Peter. If you have sex with her, you give her all the power.
Let me get lined up right, so she'll think it's you she's having sex with.
You know, Angela, I've been thinking about it, and I want to have sex with you now.
to come in here and give you a good shoe to the gift bag. You know, keep you in line.
I thought you had to be in the NBA to hit a girl in the face.
It means standing up to fart, not hidin' it in a pillow or holdin' it in till your stomach goes...
Angela, I came over here to punch you and maybe kick you in the boob.
Because I vowed to myself that I would spend the last night of my life in the company of the most beautiful woman in the world.
Oh, if only I could, but I must to a Jew to put my affairs in order.
Well, I got my job back, Angela's happy again, and she's not gonna harass me anymore.
Wait a minute, Rupert, there's a weapons systems cooling duct on the far side of the hull.
If we can get just one good shot at it, we can blow that fat bastard out of the cosmos.
I don't know, I just feel like there might be some fun stuff down there.
It's basically Jaws, except when the guys in the boat are going after Jaws, they look around and there's an even bigger Jaws, so the guys have to team up with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.
I would have told you last night, but I was 100% sure you ripped it off.
But after spending the last 18 hours on the Internet and in libraries trying to find traces of it somewhere,
Look, I don't want to get your hopes up, but Daddy's got some connections over at CBS, and I think he could help you get this on TV.
(chuckles) Dear Diary, still no sign of that tampon from last week, but the headaches are getting worse.
I mean, Byron is a 25-year-old single father going back to finish college so he can do right by his four-year-old daughter.
So it's got to be somebody who can project a certain amount of world-wizened sophistication, while at the same time retaining a certain youthfully passionate idealism.
Actually, in my mind, there's only one actor who could do this role: Elijah Wood.
You know, Brian, you've spun gold into these pages, and it's our job to bring that gold to the screen.
Okay, now obviously, we love Elijah Wood for the part of Byron as much as you do.
Now, this is the scene where Byron's professor fails him for missing the chemistry midterm to take his daughter to the doctor.
Maybe this is news to you, but love isn't some element on your periodic table.
Somebody upstairs threw out a name, got real excited about it, so we're just playing the game.
We should have told somebody, but we were too scared, and-and-and I wanted to take him to the hospital, but Chris wouldn't let me.
I used to knock you kids out every month or so, sometimes by accident, sometimes when the Patriots lost.
Hey, good evening, everyone, and welcome to the first taping of CBS's new hit comedy,
Yeah, it didn't make a lot of sense now that he lives on Boner Street.
Well, yeah, I mean, but the real victory is just having a show make it to TV.
You had a vision and you let them change it because you didn't believe in yourself.
Byron wants to do right by his daughter, and I think that everyone can relate to that.
And every month, he's got a story for why he doesn't have his half of the rent.
I wrote a script that really meant a lot to me, and you guys took it and turned it into something cheap and ridiculous.
'cause I banged that chick, and I think she is well under 18 years old.
I think we gotta take these bandages off and see what we're dealin' with here.
He's really hurt, and I'm gonna do what I should have done in the first place.
Let's put a hat on him to cover the wound, and-and then let's get some makeup and draw eyeballs on his eyelids and find a way to pin this on someone else.
Our top story tonight, scientists at NASA have made a fascinating new discovery: the first directly observable instance of a black hole, which appears to be located just outside our solar system.
Tom, I'm standing here with Stephen Hawking, the first white man I've ever met who knows math better than me.
Mr. Hawking, what does the discovery of this black hole mean to you and your research?
I am part of an elite group of individuals deemed intelligent enough to decide the fate of a fellow citizen.
The only reason you've never been called is that they use the voter registration list, and this past election is the first time you ever voted.
And if your wife ever tells you that you're not special, punch her really hard right in her hepatitis.
And the worst part is, they try and trick you into getting excited by putting duty in the title.
We're gonna ask you a series of questions to determine whether or not you can be impartial jurors.
First off, do any of you have any prejudices you feel the court should know of?
All right, now the prosecution is about to show you items pertinent to this case that have been entered into evidence.
It is vitally important that you look but don't touch, as any fingerprints could contaminate them.
I would like to remind members of the jury that you are forbidden to discuss details of the case outside the courtroom.
Aw, hey, you know how the judge told us not to make up our minds beforehand?
Hey, I know the judge said not to run in the hall, but check this out!
NASA has made the alarming announcement that the newly discovered black hole at the edge of our solar system appears to be expanding.
Neptune and Pluto have already been consumed, and scientists estimate that the event horizon will reach Earth by tomorrow.
Seems like I've run out of waiting time. ...but it looks like Nicole Ritchie's baby is gonna be just fine.
Also in the news, the doomsday clock is ticking with less than 19 hours to go before our planet is consumed by an expanding black hole.
As Americans everywhere face their last day on Earth, one can only imagine how they're spending it.
Well, it's become clear, the only way to avert this disaster is by writing a strongly-worded letter to the black hole. Dear space. Well, you're just full of surprises, aren't you? You think you're so good 'cause you went to Choate. Well, you're not gonna be so tough when I put a fish bowl on my head and a rocket pack on my back and come up there and punch you.
Well, Diane, now that our time is almost up, just to lighten the mood, we introduce a new feature called Tom's Crank Calls.
I want you kids to know how much your father and I love you and how important this family is to us.
I don't know, but from the look in a stray cat's eyes when you're pushing on its windpipe,
You know, I went to the zoo last week and asked if I could do it, and they told me to scram.
Went to the zoo this morning with a shotgun and now I have a lion.
It was real, good old-fashioned grab the nearest tree and hold on for dear life gay, not today's fancy, featherbed, thread-count gay.
Stay with us as the countdown to Doomsday continues with just six more hours to go.
The only thing that's nice about this is even though it's a Tuesday, it feels kinda like it's a Friday.
I'm gonna find a black neighborhood and see what happens if I yell the you-know-what word.
Any moment now, the Earth will be sucked into the gaping maw of the black hole.
We here at Channel Five would like to leave you with some highlights of mankind's brief existence, like the Battle of Hastings.
And with only 30 seconds to go, we thank you for choosing Channel Five as your Armageddon network.
You know, you'd think you'd wanna spend your last day on Earth with your family!
We at Channel Five News concocted the whole black hole story as part of our commitment to being festive around the holidays.
And with only 87 suicides and widespread looting, we think this was a pretty successful practical joke.
Peter, what did you mean by what you said, you hate bein' around the kids?
I know, and I love 'em, but don't you just sometimes wish they'd run away or get kidnapped and be made to work in a Temple of Doom?
Peter, if you really do care about your kids, you're gonna have to earn back their respect and affection.
You know, I was just thinkin', when I was your age, my Uncle Roy shared a beer with me.
Trapjaw is trying to get a variance to build an unpermitted structure within ten feet of Optimus Prime's property line.
Destro is the City Councilman who's telling Trapjaw that he has to file it as an accessory structure, and even then it can only be built at the rear of the lot.
Look, I know you kids ain't too happy with your dad right now, but I hope at least you could see that I'm tryin'.
Hell, if we weren't all related, this would be like the worst table at the wedding.
But I-I can still be your dad even if we don't have any of the same interests.
I know they're supposed to be wise, but all it did was shriek and poop out half-digested mice.
Well, I guess if you can't earn your kids' respect, you can always buy it.
Dad, can we please have a turn at the Xbox? uh, now, which one do I press to shoot now?
Good evening, America. Tonight we present a full hour of Family Guy, beginning with a very special extended episode, followed by some never-before-seen musical clips.
I was gonna take it home, show it to Lois, make her proud of me.
And if I want to return this sweater, we've got to get to Wyndham's by half 6:00. Half 6:00?
You know, today started as a really nice outing, but as usual, you had to ruin it.
You know, I-I was actually hoping that you'd talk me out of returning this sweater.
You know, it's the one time I ever splurged on myself, and you have to go and make me feel foolish.
So, you invented a time machine, but you can't get us out of a safe?
Can't believe this. We're locked in here until tomorrow and the only thing I've eaten today was a grape Chris dropped at breakfast.
It took me half an hour just to get the damn thing off the floor.
Okay, well, I can't be in a soiled diaper until tomorrow, Brian; we both know that.
So what I would need you to do is eat what's in my diaper, lick the diaper clean, possibly lick my fanny and then put the diaper back on me.
I think you're the salesman who helped me pick out a Thom Browne sweater two weeks ago.
Um, and I don't think I'm gonna make it to the store before closing time today.
You stink! And now I'm trapped in here with you and your stink because you were too stupid to call somebody who could help us!
I suppose the easiest way would be to use the diaper as a-a bowl of sorts.
This will take one second, and then we can put this whole unpleasantness behind us.
Oh, and just do me a favor and tell me when you're about to begin because I don't wanna be surpri...  Moon river!
I like what comes out of Lois' breasts better, but I, I like this, too.
Oh, wait, I can hurdle my own leg like they used to do in the '90s.
This is gonna sound really weird, but I really want you to do it, okay? Wha... what?
First you have to say that you'll do it before I tell you, no mat... no matter what it is.
I don't give a... I'm all worked up right now, so we have to do it. Just do it, okay?
You know, I don't, I don't know why I told Matthew that I liked, that I liked The Bounty Hunter
Cesar Millan. Right, Cesar Millan talks about living in the moment because that's how dogs live, you know?
Everybody that works in an office is gonna say to their coworkers, Hey, type in 'dog, baby, heinie lick.'
Oh, yeah, that's funny. I saw that in my room. Okay, now type in 'Japanese, fish, ass.'
Well, I could save you the embarrassment and shoot you in the head except there aren't any bullets in this gun.
Oh, picky for someone who eats the same food out of a plastic bowl on the floor every night.
A bowl that starts in the kitchen at the beginning of a meal and ends up in the living room. Shut up.
You... you... what about all that liberal crap you're always spewing about stricter gun regulations?
I hate the idea of you getting your thrills pressing a gun up against your crotch.
Oh, good, 'cause that'd be strange if you had fantasies about pressing a gun up against your crotch and feeling your heartbeat through your balls.
Dogs are supposed to be able to instinctively live with purpose, not even to have think about it, just born like that.
You know, I've tried to find meaning in my life, and I just... I just can't.
And, you know, I'm not talking about purpose in the shallow, Rick Warren over-the-counter self-help variety because that's... that's just delusion.
I mean, is there ever a time when we're truly in the present moment and not looking toward the past or the future?
I mean, not in like a Hey, let's, you know, let's have an underpants party, or whatever grownups do when they're in love, but I mean,
I mean, I love you as one loves another person whom one simply cannot do without.
Okay, go. Chapter One: I am born. Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station shall be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life,
And for the rest of the hour, we'd like to treat you to some of your favorite Family Guy musical moments.
That's right. Some you may know, and others you've never seen before- like this first one.
Peter and his friends from the National Association for the Advancement of Fat People never got to mourn for any of the victims.
One thing we like to do at Family Guy is make fun of pop culture by twisting it and mocking it and commenting on it.
A Jerry Lewis film entitled The Errand Boy that was created for the episode where Peter takes over Pewterschmidt Industries.
Several years back, Brian made friends with an elderly woman who had been homebound for years, and he attempted to bring her out of her shell.
We became close friends, and I sang this song to explain to her all the wonderful things that she was missing by shutting herself off from society.
Quahog is a wonderful example of suburban America-- full of neighbors who look out for each other and enjoy spending time together.
Up next, we find Peter and Lois in need of a babysitter, and their kind, elderly neighbor, Herbert, offers to help out.
And now we have a super special treat: a never-before-aired clip that may be the greatest thing we've ever done.
You know, when it comes to road show episodes, you and I do most of the traveling.
True, but when Peter found out that his father wasn't Francis, the man who raised him, but instead a man in Ireland, Peter decided to visit.
And did we explore the effects of the difficult political and agricultural dynamics that have rent Ireland for centuries?
We all sang a song about how they take the best parts out of everything.
I know, and the worst part is that after the song aired, we heard the FCC people liked it.
I mean, like, you know, like when-when... when you make fun of someone and then they laugh.
The fact that your last name is Griffin is a pleasantry extended from our family, not by any legality.
Yeah, and someday, when you're ready, you're gonna walk off into the woods and die.
Yeah, so there's this seminar in New Haven on creating your own Web-based Internet series.
Is this another one of those classes where you make the checks out directly to the teacher's name?
Anyway, the navy is honoring him at this year's naval ball for all his bravery in Vietnam.
Sir, you gotta tell them about the time you had to eject from your plane behind enemy lines.
I'd gotten a haircut earlier that day, the first one I ever got over there that looked like anything.
The breeze was just warm enough that you could wear short sleeves, but you know, not so warm that you break any kind of a sweat. because let me tell you, I do hate to perspire. It just ruins...
And a lot of little things: the way he talks, his mannerisms, and he had the complete DVD set of Sex and the City between his butt cheeks.
I guess I could, but I don't know if it'll do any good, Lois; he's in complete denial, like people in massive debt.
Well, I'll tell you what we're not gonna do: shoot all of our children and then kill ourselves.
My dad wanted me to tell you he would be thrilled if you and Lois would join us as his guest at the naval ball.
Um... hey, remember when we met him the other day, and he danced for a while?
At the navy ball, you'll see how much of a man he is and how everyone in the military respects him.
Huh. It's great to see you back in your element tonight; surrounded by seamen. Seamen.
I can't tell you how many loads you dad took when I served with him. Huh?
He has an appointment Friday with Dr. Hartman to have the procedure, and he wants me to go with him.
Well, I'm sure your friend Peter would be happy to come along for moral support.
We should put on some '80s music, and then, like, every few minutes, have him come out of there as a different sex, and we'll go...
Okay, kids, Mr. Quagmire and his dad... his moth... his friend are coming over soon for dinner.
Is that just like, r... implas or did they reassign some ass fat up there?
All I've talked about for years with these people is what a war hero you were.
For me it was easy: Do I want to be happy the rest of my life or miserable?
You know, every little interaction, every little moment is another scene captured by this camera.
So I finally tell them, Hey, I came here to be at the seminar, not run it.
Not to worry, I called in, and a new cell phone should be here for you in three business days.
You know, I've heard the phrase soul mate for years, and I never got it till last night.
I mean, like, what do those people do as far as relationships and sex and stuff?
I was wrong to just assume that you would understand and be able to accept this.
This is the story of a great adventure that happened to me and some of my pals.
You and I will have one cabin, and Bonnie and Joe and Quagmire will have the other two.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, the reason Chris was suspended is that he told a very inappropriate joke in class.
I don't know where Chris heard the joke, but I can assure you it wasn't at home.
Was it the one where the blind man walks by the fish market and says, Good morning, ladies?
You know, you got Chris suspended from school for telling one of your dirty jokes.
I didn't know what to do, so I took them off and hummed them at the wall, and they started sliding down like one of them sticky octopuses.
Well, it's a pretty funny joke, you know, when you think about it. Your vagina's in the sink.
That's right. Thought I'd come by and see if you have any jokes to tell.
You know, I-I got to admit, Quagmire, despite all the problems, that joke is freaking hilarious.
And so began our journey to find the splendid source of off-color humor as we know it.
REO Speedwagon saved us several stops, as they, too, had backtracked the joke to some extent.
But when their trail had led to a bartender in Virginia, they had given up, much the way the world had given up on them.
In fact, just to kick them a couple extra bucks, here's five seconds of Time for Me to Fly.
Besides, this will be way more fun than hanging out in Maine with the wives, sitting around a campfire, listening to Lois tell grocery stories. Oh, Peter, you should have been there. Uncle Ben's converted brown rice was on sale.
Think of the most intense pain you've ever felt, and imagine feeling that for hours.
They didn't think I was far enough, but I was like, I can tell you I'm far enough.
Have you girls ever worked in an office with other women who you have negative things to say about?
But then Daddy got frustrated 'cause he couldn't find it, so we just ate fast food in the parking lot.
Donna's been nice enough to invite us to stay the weekend, and frankly, that sounds better than continuing this wild-goose chase.
Well, Lois, if you and Bonnie want to stay here, maybe Cleveland could join us.
All right, well, if you have a sudden change of heart and you want to chase us down the street as we're pulling away, you know where to find us.
Would you rather get a massage from a man or surgery from a female doctor?
So, it's basically- would you rather get a massage from a gay man or die?
Let Amy Winehouse spit in your mouth or eat a raw slice of Anderson Cooper's ass?
It might be safe to assume that someone does not want us to learn the origin of that joke.
And if we had known what lay ahead, we would've stopped right there and gone straight back to Quahog.
There it is-- Washington, DC, the seat of government for the world's former most powerful nation.
We were all terrified that this would prove to be an unexpected end to our journey.
And as if that weren't bad enough, we found ourselves on a plane, headed to an unknown destination.
After flying for what seemed like hours, we found ourselves approaching a strange island on the horizon.
So the housewife tells the plumber, Okay, you cleed my pipes, now get to work on that sink.
Well, many of the world's greatest geniuses secretly devote themselves to coming up with the world's dirtiest jokes.
Sir, we have a Best Man giving a toast at a wedding, and he is just bombing.
If we can figure out a way to get to it, I can fly us home!
One of us should pretend we're hurt, and when the guards come in to give him medical attention, we'll jump 'em!
Well, well, it's quite clear the four of you are going to be a problem.
Now take me back to Virginia, so I can put some Bacitracin on this and pork my wife!
See, the March of Dimes wanted this air time to talk about cancer kids or somethin', but I was like, No way! Monkey scratch!
This is the story of a great adventure that happened to me and some of my pals.

Hey, you guys, I hate to do this to you, but I gotta get out of here.
All right, I'm gonna go out and look for him. I'll take my Don Don.
You will go to the Dagobah system and learn the ways of the Force from Yoda.
Last time I was in a Dago bar I was drinking a beer in Little Italy.
Well, your managed-to-keep-me-around- a-little-longerness, it looks like you managed to keep me around a little longer.
I think you just can't stand to let a fat guy like me out of your sight.
What? I just wanna share my throbbing emotions and shoot hot hug all over you.
Lord Vader, we've entered the Hoth system, but the Rebels have put up an energy shield blocking our entry.
However, we have decided that our transports will travel directly toward the fleet of Star Destroyers.
What if I give you the money, then you can go out and buy it?
Yeah, I just got laser torpedoed by an Imperial walker and I need roadside assistance.
Okay, great. Annoying question. We have to get gas, would you mind pulling off and waiting for us while we do that?
They give him a wide berth, but they don 't let him out of their sight.
I've just found that Leia's constant questioning of me has not been productive to the atmosphere of the ship.
But the good hands people at Allstate will make sure you have a soft landing.
I'm asking, did you see the DVD frat house edition with all the uncensored footage and the interview with Ryan Reynolds?
It starts with checking out sweet-ass DVD releases, like Iron Man, directed by Jon Favreau.
'cause he seems like the kind of guy who'd help you move if you asked him.
I'm glad you're here. Look, I pulled this all apart, and it looks like you're gonna need a new condenser.
Yeah, and I would also highly recommend a complete flush of your photon conversion system.
Okay, well, how about this? Do you want me to just go ahead and do that while I'm replacing the new condenser?
Really? Maybe I can make him go bi, but all the way is gonna be tough.
RECRUITMENT ANNOUNCER: The Empire, chasing Rebel scum, killing Luke's aunt and uncle, telling people to move along.
You know, I'm up for this, but it kind of feels like the dark side has a better gym than us.
Correct. I also would've accepted the rotting old woman in The Shining, but Kathy Bates is probably worse. Best scene in Teen Wolf?
When Michael J. Fox is in the bathroom, turning into a werewolf for the first time and his dad's knocking on the door and he is freaking out and he opens the door and his dad's a werewolf, too.
I would've also accepted the scene at the end, at the basketball game, where the guy in the crowd has his dick out.
Go online. Look it up. He's in the stands, way in the background, and he's totally got his dick out.
Chewie, get ready to release the landing claw and we'll float away with their garbage. Release!
I see a woman draining your bank account and running off with a real estate agent.
Wait, wait, wait. Luke, that's a stupid idea. You're not done with all your Force stuff.
I got into a slap fight with a prep droid over a pair of cargo shorts.
Okay, the door's gonna open and you guys say, Freeze, and point your guns at them.
DARTH VADER: Very well, Solo, if you won't talk, we have very effective means of torture.
All right, Luke's on Dagobah, there's a Rebel base on Kashyyyk, and I'm the one who clogged the toilet on the 16th floor.
DARTH VADER: This facility should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his trip to the Emperor.
And as long as we're freezing things, why don't you toss this ice cube tray full of orange juice in there?
Nice work, fellas! And, David, you sold the most magazine subscriptions, so you get to invite four of your friends to a pizza party.
Well, even though we know exactly where he's going, we should rescue him in three years.
You know? I mean, it doesn't have to be as father and son, it can just be as, you know, as two really close guys who just happen to be men, you know?
I mean, it's not even about the doing it part, but that's a part of it, but it's not the whole thing.
And, you know, the offer's still open for the whole two dudes running the galaxy plan.
Don't worry, we'll find Jabba the Hutt and that bounty hunter, and we'll get Han back.
A letter. Dear Luke, if my calculations are correct, you should receive this letter at the exact moment the DeLorean vanished. I have been living happily for the past six months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that...
I don't know that. I haven't seen that show in a while and I don't know that anyone else has.
Oh, sure, it's a blast being in a room full of people you don't know.
Look, I'm just not wild about the idea of running into anybody you used to date, that's all.
Wait, you mean, you two used to, you know, bump japanese cartoon monkey logo mouth.
All right, you guys, I've got a few porn scenarios for you to choose from
Why don't I get you seated in the dining room and then we'll pour the wine.
All right, we're running out of time. Are we going to get this orgy started or what?
And it was suggested that I find a healthy woman who would considered carrying our child to term.
All right, Peter, I don't know what this is about, but you're my best friend and I'd like to think that you do the same for me.
I mean... I mean which one of you has the thing that's horribly wrong with them.
I've given this long and careful thought and I decided to carry Naomi and Dale's child for them.
Look, I know it's an inconvenience, but it's a wonderful gift to be able to give someone, so I am going through with it.
She's doing something wonderful for a couple who can't have their own children and are too egoitistical to adopt.
Lois, I don't want you walking around all pregnant for nine months, just to hand over that thing when it comes out like a hen to a farmer.
Oh, and I'm supposed to blindly go along with everything you decide for the both of us?
Just like I co-exist with the tiny race of people who live in our carpet.
Now, Mrs. Griffin, you should understand, a procedure like this is not without its risks.
For example, here's what happened, when we fertilized an egg from Shelly Duvall with a sperm from James Blunt.
But Lois, if they do it good enough, they'll save the rec center from being torn down and replaced by some mall.
I know you are not happy about this, but I am pregnant, and I am having this baby.
You'll be fat and cranky, and your boobs will get bigger, and you'll stop having your period.
So, Whiskers, how does it feel to finally win your event after years of training?
Well, there is no harm in visiting the family planning center just to see what your options are.
Lois, do I need to do anything tomorrow that doesn't involve me being bent over in excruciating pain three feet from a toilet?
Okay, what, so you go stab it in there with a laser and you try to zap it out?
What? So what? You like hold her legs open and like send a pitbull in there?
You know, you can't get it away from him, cause, you know, it's his thing.
No. Mr. Griffin, it's a very simple safe procedure, in which we very precisely and delicately remove the embryo.
Sir, we are doing all that we can to stop the killing of millions of unborn babies.
But before you do, remember: science has proven that within hours of conception a human fetus has started a college fund and has already made your first Mother's Day card out of macaroni and glitter.
Just like so many other promising human lives, who were probably snuffed out by abortion.
And did you know the baby you aborting may also have a baby inside of it that you're also aborting?
But according to the law, it is still my right to choose what I do with my body.
Would you go down to the orphanage and claim an unwanted baby and take care of it?
What if you look at the ultrasound and see that the baby is gonna be born with no arms and no legs?
Oh, so what? You-you kill a bunch of doctors to show that the killing is wrong?
And we would not gonna solve anything by standing here and screaming at each other.
And whatever we decide, we both have to agree that it's the right thing to do.
And we don't come down until we've made a decision that we both can live with.
All right, at ease, at ease. Dear Willy, it's been awful lonesome since you've been away.
We got invited to a party. Peter Griffin, you and your family are cordially invited to a gala dinner in your honor at Rocky Point Manor.
I assumed it was for being able to fart the alphabet, which I almost did till I pooped on the S.
Everyone got invitations from an anonymous source for a dinner in their honor, when that's clearly not the case.
Some people think Jennifer Connelly's old now, and that her hands look like two bags of snakes.
She came into my life as if out of nowhere, enchanted me beyond my wildest dreams, and opened my eyes to the cleansing truth of Jesus Christ's love.
Well, the fact of the matter is, I have wronged each and every one of you in some way.
I understand that there is some healing to do here tonight, and I am prepared to be patient.
Maybe if I sit in his chair, I can get a reading on his energy.
Look, everybody but Chris, just keep your pants on and let's figure a way out of this.
I was going to the bathroom, and I just couldn't stop looking at my penis,
Well, maybe that dead pile of cookie dough in the next room will refresh your memory.
All right, I don't know what's happening here, but look, I'm a lot of things.
A member of Mensa, a huge hit with the ladies, someone who, you know, would have broken out bigger if he weren't so impossible to work with.
If I were you, I'd keep your mouth shut till you talk to a lawyer.
This gun was timed to fire directly at that chair, where James Woods would have been sitting.
The fact that no one has said anything makes it even more obvious that everyone has noticed.
All right, since it's my fault that Joe got knocked out, it is now my responsibility to take over the investigation.
The gun was clearly meant to kill James Woods, but Stephanie got in the way.
No. Actually, I was a normal guy until one night, we dropped acid together, and he thought I was a steak.
He took the Twitter name Mayor West, so now I have to use Mayor underscore West.
Why don't you come over to my place for a glass of wine and a couple of fruit pies, and then we can go in the back room and play crazy snake. Hee-hee-hee!
One day, I bring my nephew to work, and he molest my nephew, and my nephew-- he only 14, and he cry, and then, he shoot himself in the face.
Says here he talked Muriel into selling him OxyContin for him and his 19-year-old girlfriend.
This went on for weeks, but then she started to have misgivings and threatened to cut him off.
Well, as long as there's a murderer on the loose, none of us are safe.
We-we-we were gonna use this time, uh... to figure out what to get you for your birthday.
If I should die, I-I just want you to know that they might find some things.
And I just want you to know, from me, it's all gonna be out of context.
I have no idea. d Linda Evans and John Forsythe d d They're coming down big, long stairs d d Come on, Brian, you know this d d We're all rich d d And we're all at least in our late 50s d d Think Joan Collins d d Come on, Brian, you know this d d It's the middle trumpet part d d It was a pretty big deal for Diahann Carroll d d To play a rich, black woman in the 80s. d
If we don't find out before this storm lets up, we're all gonna be dead by morning.
All right, if we're going to make it out alive, we got to stick together from now on.
So I followed it, and it led me to a hatch over there in the parlor.
I was standing in the foreground gng like this when Jillian took the picture, so by forced perspective, it looks like I'm holding up the whole sign.
If I can get up to the roof or something, maybe I can get a stronger signal and call the police.
So all we have to do is find that Golden Globe and we'll have our murder weapon-- and if we're lucky, it may just mean we'll have our killer.
Yes. It helps me get to sleep, knowing that Big Tom Tucker is keeping a watchful eye out for nocturnal intruders.
Shoot. What if half of us go around one side of the table, and the other half go around the other side, and then we won't have to chase him around in circles.
I feel like a lot of people were looking at me like I was really attractive.
Okay, well, I don't see the fire engine, but I guess we'll just find out when we get home, won't we?
It's just... so hard to believe you can work with someone for 15 years and yet have no idea who they really are or what they're capable of.
Gosh, I, uh, you know, I think I'd better, uh... go make sure Peter has his, uh... fire engine.
Well, I suppose it all really began a year ago when James Woods and I met at a press event and began seeing each other.
We both valued our privacy, however, so we agreed to keep it a secret from the media.
It was hard for me to begin with, but it got worse when, not so coincidentally,
Tom began pushing Channel Five News to replace me with a fresh, young face, and he succeeded.
I watched my career and my love life crumble, and I wasn't gonna just stand by and take it.
That's when I had the good fortune to meet a young news intern named Priscilla.
She was so anxious to get into the reporting business and would have done anything to get on my good side.
I paid her off to seduce James Woods and reel him into a relationship like a fish on a line.
I knew a hot, young woman like Priscilla could manipulate him into doing anything I wanted.
At my direction, she persuaded him to become a born-again Christian, and instilled him with the drive to bring together all the people he'd wronged.
Of course, Priscilla knew nothing of my real intentions, but she played the part beautifully, nonetheless.
I planned to kill James Woods and frame Tom Tucker, thereby destroying the two people who cast me aside and ruined my life.
I knew I couldn't risk her revealing that I had engineered this whole gathering... so I killed her.
I had to leave the knife in her, because I couldn't very well hide it on my person with everyone quickly closing in.
I slipped in with the rest of the group, when they all converged on the scene.
When Peter was yelling at everyone about that picture of Derek holding up the Hollywood sign,
I barely had enough time to plant the Golden Globe in Tom's room and run back downstairs, where I took advantage of the commotion and joined the crowd as they were all running outside.
Well, actually, Lois and I were just about to go for a quick walk, weren't we, Lois?
Why am I trying to figure this out when I could be listening to my tapes in the car?
Well, it's a shame that you have to die, Lois, but look on the bright side:
She was shot by an unknown assailant, after she herself committed a series of gruesome murders.
In local news, there was a hit-and-run by a drunk driver today at Quahog Park.
You saw it with your own eyes and then you reported it on Fox News.
Don't they have bookstores at the Nazi fascist... fascist fat camp where he, where he go-- where he, where he is a counselor?
I tell you what, Brian, if you want, we'll give you another crack at that.
You know what? I'm gonna go down there and give that bastard Limbaugh a piece of my mind.
Listen, Limbaugh, my name is Brian Griffin, and I have got something to say to you.
Yes, uh, valid points you're raising, my friend, and I respect you for raising them.
But I've read things other people have written about the things you've written, and I do not approve of the things I've read from others about the things they've read from you.
What-What if I stick a piece of bologna in the book, and I don't tell you which page?
I-I can't believe I'm saying this, but this might be the best book I've ever read.
You know, I've never actually read any of Limbaugh's stuff, but this book makes an excellent case for personal accountability, fiscal responsibility and steak eatership.
And as a reasonable person, I reserve the right to change my mind when presented with new information that alters my perspective.
But if you drive something else, you're probably a guy who likes to pleasure other men sexually.
I knew you'd like it, and I'm glad you enjoyed it, Brian, I really am.
I-I want to find the right words to describe how much I agree with you.
I got the words, Brian. Thank you, Rush, for doing my thinking for me, 'cause I lack the ability to think critically and independently. Yes, that!
Well, listen, I'd really love to pick your brain some more and hear some of your other thoughts about what's going on in this country.
And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling Republicans.
Look, Brian, all I'm saying is, it's not normal for people to change their political views so radically overnight.
Whoever's on top, whoever's in power, whoever's successful, you got to be on the other side or you don't feel like the smartest guy in the room.
Look, Lois, if I were you, I'd stow that attitude, because Rush Limbaugh is coming over for dinner tonight.
Dear God who definitely exists, we, your people, who have been on this planet for 6,000 years and not a second more, wish to thank you for this bounty, and for keeping Congress predominantly white through Christ our Lord, amen.
So, Rush, I see you made it here okay, driving on roads built with public funds, by the government.
Well, maybe more people could if the government wasn't taxing the bajeezus out of them.
But if you can't accept me now that we disagree about certain things, then maybe you aren't the friends
Let's all just sit here for a moment and remember that this was a thing.
Hey, you know, I've been reading all your books and I so 100% agree with you.
Oh, yeah, I took the liberty of replacing your old one with a new, American-made coffee machine.
Oh, a couple things: that light fixture... new heat regulator on your stove... your man-bra... your garbage disposal... your dishwasher... and your new cat.
I want to take a moment to give a shout-out to my good friend Ken Lay, faked his own death, listening in on a ham radio somewhere in international waters.
You strap her to a board, put a cloth in her mouth and pour water over it to simulate drowning.
You got to lead people there with an intelligent argument so they arrive at it on their own.
Brian, look, there is no victory unless people know why they were wrong to disagree with you in the first place.
My-- right now my problem seems to be that I am talking to a Pelosi-lover.
No, I'm here to strap you to a board, put a cloth in your mouth and pour water over it to simulate the sensation of drowning.
Yeah, I keep Strom Thurmond's corpse in the front seat so I can use the carpool lane. Oh.
It's not a coincidence you turned your back on your democratic principles just when the Democrats became the political establishment.
Right there. See, the fact that you would give a woman credit for anything... it means you're a liberal, Brian.
Wherever there's a rich white guy in need of another tax break, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a brain-dead woman in need of expensive life support her husband doesn't want, I'll be there.
Wherever there's a country that needs to be invaded for reasons that don't exactly pan out, I'll be there, too.
I think you are a godless, socialist, pot-smoking, maggot-infested member of the blame-America-first crowd, and I think you want the terrorists to win.
I wanted to bring, um, an owl on this trip, but Lois wouldn't let me.
ANNOUNCER: This PBS program is brought to you by generous grants from the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in association with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with additional funding by Archer Midland Whiteman
Colgate Palmolive, Exxon Mobil, and a 20 I found in a blazer I wore to a wedding last year.
I don't know, maybe... Maybe you had to see the first three to get this, but I... I am completely lost.
Look, Peter, why don't you just grab a book off the shelf and be quiet?
Only if it has a mirror at the end of it, and it says, How about you?
BARBARA: My friend and I held our breath, wondering which one of us he was talking to.
Boy, you can take a punch, but at the same time, you cowered a little bit.
Unfortunately, that was the year the great war with Alaska broke out, and even Carter's lofty connections couldn't save him from the draft.
Carter never forgot to write to me daily to send his love along with a mix tape.
BARBARA: But after some months, the letters stopped coming, and I was certain he had perished.
He would bring me small chocolates and sit in my front parlor and pitch woo at me, taking my hand gently and singing from bended knee the popular songs of his youth.
I agreed that I would marry him forthwith, even though my heart still belonged to Carter.
I believe Rodginald knew this, and he even tried to strike me in the manner to which I had become accustomed.
Dear, sir, I respectfully urge you to prepare yourself for one devil of a skirmish!
Look, Peter, if you're that hungry, go down to the dock and find Daddy, and we'll get dinner started.
And she will, but only because she needs money to pay for medicine for her prematurely overweight son Diabeto.
Well, we were there the other night for dinner, and I caught him cheating with some bimbo.
Anyway, he told me not to tell anybody, but I'm having a real hard time not telling Lois.
But for those who do, and then turn their back on its long-standing convictions? Shame!
Y... You could probably get him to pay through the nose to keep your mouth shut.
Oh! Now, I have to wait a whole week to find out if she gave in to peer pressure at that drinking party!
Well, I was getting ready to watch a movie on your big TV, but first I thought I'd use your hot bubbly toilet.
I hope you were careful, 'cause I swear to God, if I find one Ike in there, I'm going straight to Babs.
Next, I want you to fly to France and tell French people that a good-looking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie.
(over loudspeakers): People of France, a good-looking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie, and your sirens sound like gay guys having a threesome.
I just want you to know this was a huge pain in the ass. Peter's New Catch Phrases, by Carter Pewterschmidt.
Also, I've been under the weather lately, so it may not be my best work. Shape up or show me your balls.
Oh, man, there are a lot of good ones here. Fire alarm? I am the fire alarm. Find your own beach house, Crabby. Put that in your office and frame it.
No, this one here. If you've got a problem, take it up with my butt.
You know, Lois, I've noticed Peter and Carter spending a lot of time together lately.
You know, I keep not laughing at The Big Bang Theory, and I figure it's got to be the television, you know?
TV this size... Forget it, it'll have me laughing till I got snots falling out of my nose.
(mechanically): Because Peter is the best and he is awesome and he makes better laser sounds than I do.
Yeah, plus think of all the fun stuff you can do as a single guy.
Like... Like going to loud, awful bars and not being able to heart the mediocre-looking chick next to you say something stupid.
Here, I got these off a web site that tells you good things to say when hot women walk by.
Um, I... I love getting trendy cupcakes in the middle of the day for no reason.
Hey, boy, boy, fetch me a John Barrymore and soda and three Myrna Loys for the women.
I had a moment of weakness, but I... I know now that I was wrong.
All right, if I've learned anything from romantic comedies it's that the ex-wife always falls in love with her husband again after he befriends a little kid.
Oh, Babs, I don't wish to overwhelm you with my passions, but I must say this.
Do you think perhaps one day, if we should marry, that I could sit beside you?
Give me one more chance, and I pledge to place above you nothing... Not even myself...
I know I can't do it overnight, but we can still have a lot of years together.
So, if you'd like to move back in and take things slowly, one step at a time,
Oh, well, every Halloween, me, Joe and Quagmire do this thing where one of us is it, and then the other two of us nail the crap out of him with awesome pranks.
I'm Dick Pump, and I'd appreciate it if you hooligans didn't get your eggs all over my parcel.
Well, how do you not know that your reflection in the patio door isn't another dog?
You gonna go see three movies in a row so it seems like you're out doing something?
But I'm a modern vampire duck who hangs around with Anna Paquin and drives around in a black Mercedes.
Oh, but I hope he doesn't have some gross Jewish candy, like-like Rugelach or-or Hamentashen or-or Hachahachahacha.
My mother bought it for me, and I was worried it might be a tad banal, but if you big kids like it, then it must be pretty cool.
You can have the apple and the raisins and the cheese and crackers with the little red stick.
Yeah, no, I heard you, he was a Karma Chameleon, but how-how come I never met him?
And Halloween's got to be the worst night of the year to be a cop.
All you do is drive around, confiscate beer from teenagers and occasionally handcuff a drunk woman in a sexy costume.
My cousin went to a Halloween party and made out with a guy, and she's hideous.
If we wear our masks and we don't take them off for the whole party, the boys won't know who we are, and we'll have a better chance of hooking up.
I do five hours of math homework every night even though I'm no longer in school.
All right you guys, these domestic dispute situations can get pretty dicey, so I need you to stay in the car, okay?
All right, sir, sir, ma'am. I just need you to tell me clearly and calmly, what happened.
He puts one of those cigars in his mouth and he turns into a different person!
Uh, listen, my friend, Stewie, he's just a baby, and you guys took his candy earlier.
What do you say you just give it back, and we all forget this ever happened?
All right, Brian, we're getting my candy back, and here's how it's gonna go down:
I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I think that was me.
And if I think you're holding back on me, we're gonna have a serious problem.
Good. Now, go in your purse, take out $40 and put it in the bag.
Brian, you took me out on my first Halloween tonight, and you showed me an exciting time.
And for that, I'm going to let you pick out some candy from my bag. Oh, thanks.
And keep in mind, we can't use any actual brand names due to advertising concerns.
Right, okay, I'll have a Mr. Whip-o Bar, a Kooky Nut Pop, some Jim 'n M's, uh, a Zip Zap, a Choco Buddy, uh, a Sixty-Four- Thousand-Dollar Bar, a Notafinger and a Dawkin's Peanut Butter Disc.
I hooked up with a chick tonight, and I am pretty darn proud of myself.
Hey, Chris, um, I was wondering if you'd like to come to my party tomorrow.
We've reached that part of the evening when our house champion takes on all challengers.
We gonna pretend to hit each other for a while, then maybe kiss a little? Huh?
No matter what you do for the rest of your life, you'll always be garbage.
It was just one of those crazy things that sort of happened after a few drinks.
I'll take you somewhere real fancy and romantic for dinner, just the two of us.
Hey, remember when I said I think it's hot when you wear a sports bra and gym shorts underneath your dress?
It's how I feel when I burp really loud in an underground parking structure to assert my dominance.
It's like I tapped into this primal wellspring of pent-up anger that just needed to be released.
You will recall, last night, ere I drifted off into slumber with a nudie magazine betwixt my legs,
Look, Lois, it just seems to me that this isn't necessarily the healthiest thing for a woman your age to be doing.
Brian, I'm 42, I'm in the prime of my life, and this is what I want right now.
I think this is a sign that maybe it's time to hang up the gloves.
The only reason I did this in the first place was 'cause of you! What do you mean?
Peter, sometimes you're so insensitive, and you make me so angry, I just want to clock you in the jaw.
A-And the truth is, I suppose I kind of got most of it out of my system anyway.
Thank you so much for coming, everyone, and thank you for always cheering me on at all my fights.
Of me! Look at these people, giving you a statue for fighting a bunch of bums!
Why don't you bring your pretty little self over to my apartment tonight, and I'll show you a real woman.
I know I make you mad sometimes, but I thought we agreed you'd hang up the gloves.
Peter, she milked your boobs, and there were a lot of people I knew there.
I'm gonna be joined by a horribly disfigured former fighter providing barely intelligible commentary throughout.
Uh, I-I think that they're... they're gonna have, they are gonna be fightin' Deirdre's last fight in the contrast to the later one is gonna be bet-better than usually.
Well, the match lastin' the bout up until the particular inaccuracy, particular unusually that should be the ultimate determining factor in about the the heart of a champion margarine hat.
In this corner, weighing in at 134 pounds, the top-ranked boxer in all of Rhode Island,
And in this corner, weighing in at 130 pounds, it's the Ovarian Barbarian and the Breast of All Time, let's put our hands together for Quahog's own...
No hitting below the belt, no rabbit punches, no name calling, no making trouble for unconventional couples who want to adopt babies, 'cause you know what, they ain't gettin' the good babies, anyways.
I watched you raise three kids on a shoestring budget-- you never gave up then, and you're not giving up now!
And if there was a hall of fame for hearts, yours would be the biggest one in the whole damn building!
Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are at round six-- the round that Deirdre Jackson predicted she'd kill Lois Griffin.
Now, if everyone could just pick up two chairs before you leave, we can get this place cleaned up a lot quicker.
How did Lois Griffin do what no other challenger could do and knock out Deirdre Jackson?
Well, I gotta be honest, Lois, I had my doubts, but you really held your own in that ring.
And thanks to Deirdre, I even got some of my own milk to put on my cereal.
And there's a note from my publisher. We are returning all of the unsold copies of Faster Than the Speed of Love.
I bought a vase last week and it's still in the box, and I just want to check to see what they used to pack it...
The number-one book on The New York Times Bestseller list is Dream Your Way to Spiritual Joy by Pauly Shore.
No, I mean it. I could do it in three hours and idiots everywhere would buy it.
Well, why don't you? Believe me, I would love to, just to make a point, but I... I've given up writing.
Thanks. Okay. Chapter One: Wish it. What are all the things you want most in the world? Use the following blank pages to write down all of your dreams and desires.
And, you know, I have a friend who might be able to help get this published.
Let's just leave it at he's a friend in publishing and he calls on Thursdays.
Um... red overalls, a yellow shirt underneath-- um, I-I-I don't really have time to do this right now.
All right, everyone, I made a very special breakfast to celebrate Brian's book coming out.
I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer.
You know, I-I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related.
Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book-- no personal questions, all right?
Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water!
Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work.
We're here with Brian Griffin, local author of the new bestseller Wish it, Want it, Do it.
Uh, well, it... it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible.
Uh... yeah. Okay, oh, so this... so now... so this is... this is a true story.
I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian.
Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00.
And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis.
Geez, how heavy? I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me.
I... it doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I... I would guess that it's probably not that.
Oh, yeah... Oh, don't even, it's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth... Oh, my God, you're amazing.
How... How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room later?
Hi, um, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.
Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I gotta tell you, that makes me feel pretty great.
Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's gotta be in you.
God, you know, Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,
I-I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's-it's really about having the courage to just kinda get inside your own head and just kinda poke around in there, you know, be, like, Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here? Hey, what do you call yourself? Oh, Wisdom. Oh, Profundity. Oh, Truth. Hey, let's, let's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book.
How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better.
It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a Japanese guy who had a cold.
Okay, so the topic is going to be, Should God play a role in politics?
Stewie, the point of the bologna is that I don't know the pill is there.
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
Uh, gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your lives.
Well, it may be popular, but I, I have to say I agree with Arianna.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, maybe, maybe 'cause it sounds like you're talking with a mouthful of syrup,
Actually, it, it, I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot want it, which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
And that's another thing, I have to say aren't wish it and want it really the same thing?
(audience laughs) I mean, your book... basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point.
Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a lot of people, Bill...
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
If I didn't know what it meant, I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...
I-I'm not gonna give you, I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction.
You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody.
Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now.
I mean, if you're gonna dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in...
Um, you know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down.
All right, Stewie, I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
And I'm here to tell you the story of a very special Christmas in Quahog.
The town was blanketed with snow, the trees were being trimmed, and everyone was making up their Christmas lists.
Of all the malls in this great country of ours, he chooses to come here.
Do you know how much talking it took to get her out of the house because of her no-hair?
That waiting in line is such a catastrophe for you that you'd rather destroy the confidence of a five-year-old cancer patient?
Yeah, yeah. And I want a Charles in Charge lunch box and I want a Magna Doodle and a new Uno game on a 'cause of I lost the Draw 2 card.
You want your kid to sit on my lap, meet me at the bar at Applebee's.
If that beslubbering, onion-eyed maggot-pie thinks he can just blow me off like that, he's got another thing coming.
Look, Stewie, I know you're disappointed that you didn't get to see Santa, but I... I'm not driving you to the North Pole.
Yeah, apparently, something happened at the mall, and she took a turn for the worse.
It doesn't sound like he wants us there for some reason, but... But we should go anyway.
Hey, you want to hear a real live-action fart instead of one of those fake cartoony ones?
Now you get your ass back into that hippie car of yours and take me to the North Pole now!
Look, I know you're upset, but why... Why don't you just sit down, write out your Christmas list, and I promise I will mail it to Santa Claus?
Well, then why do you want to go all the way to the North Pole?
Because that fat bastard blew me off at the mall, and he shall not go unpunished.
I'm gonna see the workshop, pet a few reindeer, take a few pictures of me and Santa, and then I'm gonna blow his brains out, hopefully with his bitch wife watching.
Because when you get there, you may find out it isn't what you thought it was, and I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.
I... I don't think it's a good idea for us to embark on a potentially dangerous journey whe...
Oh, I got a flock of birds that were too tired to fly back north.
Well, you know, if you had just taken me to the real North Pole to see Santa, none of this would have happened!
You do what you want, Brian, but I am going to the North Pole and I'm gonna kill that bastard!
Stewie, you're putting me in a hell of a position here, but I have no choice.
Is... Is SpongeBob not there at the bottom of the ocean giving Squidward the business? Hmm?
Is Curious George not really out there making little boats out of newspapers that he should be delivering? Huh?
I'll tell you what, you take me to the North Pole, and if Santa isn't there, I'll do something for you.
When Lois does that middle-of-the-night feeding where she doesn't even open her eyes or really wake up,
Jose, Roberto, whatever... If you've got some Latinos up here that can fix cars, that'd be great.
Well, yeah, when it's fixed, we can celebrate, but let's deal with first things first.
I don't know, my name carries a little weight, but I don't see how that matters here.
Look, we don't have enough cash to fix the car, and we're kind of on our way to the North Pole.
I think we should really try to call Lois and tell her where we are.
Hey, Lois, would you make an appointment for me to be neutered in two days?
And whatever I say in two days, do not let me convince you that I've changed my mind.
Oh, I am. In fact, I have this document that legally binds me to same.
I received a call about notarizing a document, but I am spending the day with my family, so they are here, too.
This is my wife, Janice, my daughters, Lisa and Jane, and this is Rosalyn, a friend of our daughter Jane's.
Yes. We only have a moment, for we are taking a bus tour of Providence and other places.
They were cold and tired, but Stewie was determined to carry out his plan to kill Santa Claus.
As long as I've got all you people watching, does anyone want to buy some pot?
Now, while you think about the fact that you're never going to enjoy a nocturnal breast-feeding from Lois,
I'll have you know that Bridgeport is among the world leaders in abandoned buildings, shattered glass, boarded-up windows, wild dogs and gas stations without pumps.
In fact, I think the toxins are taking even more of a toll than the inbreeding.
I started with one family of magic elves, and every year I needed more and more to keep up.
It's gotten so their instincts take over, and near the end, they just walk out into the snow and die.
Then the reindeer eat them, which has turned the reindeer into wild, feral creatures with a blood-lust for elf flesh.
It turned the increasing demands of Christmas had all but destroyed the poor old man.
All right, according to this map, we're approaching the northeast coast of the U. S.
You know, those... Those aren't socks and underwear donated by the fire department to some battered women's shelter.
It's gonna be light in six hours, and we have to deliver to the whole rest of the world!
Hopeful citizens worldwide woke up to disappointment this morning when they discovered no gifts from Santa under their Christmas trees.
If all of us everywhere can just cut back our demands and ask for only one Christmas present every year, there may still be hope.
I know it's in our nature to resist sacrifice, even in hard times, but if we don't, we may have to give up Christmas altogether.
Would you rather have dinner and then sex with Megan Fox's body with Leonard Nimoy's head on it or re-roof an entire condo complex by yourself?
You know, is it Megan Fox's neck or am I burying my face in Leonard Nimoy's turkey gizzard?
I didn't get any sleep 'cause Brian and the neighbor's dog kept me up all night.
President Barack Obama will visit James Woods High next month, and this little town of ours couldn't be more abuzz.
Just 'cause Obama's coming, everybody in my English class has to write a stupid essay about hope.
Well, I don't know what this is, but it's not what hope is about, Chris.
Hope is what gets you out of bed in the morning when it's the day of prom and you haven't been asked.
Your breasts may be small and your glasses may be thick, but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.
And though we may never reach our goals, it's hope that will save us from who we once were.
It's got to be inside you, like musical talent or athleticism or the ability to choose to be gay.
What's up, party people? Ah, what the hell are these things, curtains or something? Boring!
Top winner for the day is Peter, so you're gonna be the first to spin it.
All right, while we're waiting for the wheel to spin, you want to say hi to anybody?
Well, the principal said it was the best one in the class, and he wants me to read it aloud to introduce the President!
Remember when I used to come to school to wipe you, and I'd say, Someday I won't have to wipe you anymore and you'll do great things?
Wait a second. Give me that. Hope pushes the caterpillar through the cocoon and drives the salmon upstream.
But now you get to meet the President of the United States because of what I wrote.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid all the toxic chemicals your husband ingested from his homemade energy drink have caused total kidney failure.
Until a donor is found, he's gonna have to undergo dialysis treatments three times a week.
Aw, I know it's tough, but maybe there's something I can do to make it easier.
President Barack Obama, it will be a very big day for one local teenager who will be reading his essay to introduce the President.
I sat down with accomplished wordsmith Chris Griffin. Hope is a horizon we head for, leaving nothing behind us but fear.
You know, it's kinda weird that '80s white clothes could pass for '90s black clothes.
Suppose he's stuck somewhere, or he's trapped in an elevator or God knows what else?!
Well, as I said, Mrs. Griffin, he's on a list, but there are a lot of people ahead of him.
Unless you know someone who's a compatible organ match and would be willing to donate one of theirs.
But it turns out you are a match for a little girl who's dying in that next room over there.
The result wound up being a man-sized chicken that was incredibly hostile and ended up escaping from the lab.
Okay, Doc, we gotta have a talk at some point, but Brian, are... Are you... Are you sure about this?
Well, as a dog, Brian's kidneys are smaller and don't have the capacity of a human kidney.
Now, since the operation is tomorrow, I thought it might be a good idea to just kinda close the book, you know?
Meg, you're so beautiful on the inside, but it's very important that you know your limitations.
Well, I know they say Reach for the stars, but if we all did that, there'd be nobody left here on Earth, right?
Chris, I have watched you grow from a little boy into the young man you are today.
I know sometimes life seems tough, but you just remember to reach for the stars.
And, Lois, I only ask this because of the dire situation I'm in, but... can I, can I hump your leg for fifteen uninterrupted seconds?
You and I are going to spend the rest of our lives living right here under the slide.
Come on, you... You can live without a dog, Stewie, but you can't live without a father.
And besides, how exactly do you think we're supposed to live here on the playground?
The jungle gym is the grocery store, the swing set is the mall, the seesaw is the post office, and the sandbox is our summer home.
I mean, yes, we'll... We'll have to rent it out some years to help pay for...
Oh, no, wait, no, we won't, because I'm a famous race car driver. I forgot!
I'm happy to welcome you all here to our auditorium for something that's not a terrible play.
My sister Meg will be helping me introduce the President, since we wrote this essay together. What is Hope? by Chris and Meg Griffin.
Hope is what gets you out of bed in the morning when it's the day of prom and you haven't been asked.
Your breasts may be small and your glasses may be thick, but hope doesn't hold up a mirror.
And though we may never reach our goals, it's hope that will save us from who we once were.
And he must let the world think that he is dead, until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.
No, Brian. The new female anchor is about to do that Child of the Month segment.
Let me remind you all that this Saturday at 5:00 p.m., we'll have vespers, not to be confused with the Italian motor scooter.
And don't forget, next weekend, we will have the Sunday afternoon family picnic... as God said to Noah... weather permitting.
And thank you for the great job you did with the rummage sale for the needy last weekend.
You know, Lois, we also have a bake sale coming up, and we're short about eight pies.
I am a huge fan, and I just think you are doing a fantastic job.
And after what I went through with Diane Simmons, well, let me just say it's nice to be standing here with no one trying to murder me.
You know, it's my first anchoring job, and I'm trying to make a good impression.
We just watched that one with the little goofball who thought he was going to be a doctor.
And Julie Andrews pleaded not guilty, saying that she brought the gun to the nightclub for protection.
They let him smoke inside because all the smoke from his cigarette just floats directly back up into his face.
Hey, Joyce, when you get a chance, come take a look at the Weekapaug thing.
My pets were going wild all weekend. I think there's, like, something in the air.
Sorry. I'm just painfully aware that I'm the only member of this family who's going out for drinks with a celebrity tonight.
Why did you drive the car into the air if you didn't know how to get it back down?
Pornography. The very word conjures up images of red-light districts, unprotected sex, and of course, the turn-of-the-century pornograph machine.
Yes, local housewife and church organist Lois Griffin has revealed to this reporter that she appeared in a pornographic movie back in the early 1980s.
Evidently, Lois Griffin, star citizen of Quahog, is also Lois Griffin, star of Quest for Fur.
It just goes to show you never know what sort of person is living next door.
Yes, but they'd never let that name on TV, so I changed it to Kinney.
You told me I'd made the cheer squad, blindfolded me, and told me we were going for a special celebration breakfast.
I was standing in front of the entire school with my pants around my ankles and a hot dog in my mouth.
But we're adults now, and that doesn't give you any reason to humiliate me like this.
It was a time when women would stand topless, high on coke, on the edge of hotel balconies while the curtains were billowing around them.
My daddy's making me pay for my own tuition this semester because I maxed out all my credit cards buying a copy of E.T. at the video store.
So Raoul gave me a job at his pet store, but I still needed money.
One day I was cleaning a bird cage, and a porn producer came in, and... Well, the rest you know.
I mean, most of of them are just random background people we've never seen before anyway.
Peter, that's very sweet, but how am I supposed to live in this town if I'm a social pariah?
Look, Lois, you did what you did, and there's nothing you can change about that.
If you own the choice that you made, you take away all their power to make you feel bad about yourself.
Well, you remember a few years back, people used to make all those jokes about how Ryan Seacrest was gay?
And then he started making those jokes himself, and now nobody makes those jokes anymore.
I mean, he's still gay, but now it's no fun to joke about it, because he beat us to the punch.
And so did the Corinthians finally write back to Saint Paul, saying, Dude, enough with the letters. We have received them all, and will get back to you when we have the time. And by the way, a lot of the information you're asking for is available online.
The rest of you need to accept the fact that I made a simple mistake.

I can never figure out when the hell the studio logos end and the actual movie begins.
Well, I don't know what that is, but The... The Cat From Outer Space is a solid motion picture.
That... That big guy up there on the screen's been talking through the whole movie.
Dear Liesl, I'd like to be able to tell you how I feel about you.
Mr. Griffin and Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty of creating a public disturbance and destruction of private property.
I'm afraid I have to withdraw this witness, and I am going to those things you said I have to go to.
This sucks. Can't believe that judge is making us go to a month of AA.
You know, if you ask me, this is going to be a good thing for both of you.
One fateful night, I, uh, got behind the wheel of my brand-new sports car, blind-drunk.
Before I found AA, my ex-boyfriend and I used to get drunk and party all night.
One morning, I woke up naked with three Persians high-fiving each other on the way out of my bedroom.
This one time, me and Joe and Quagmire made a bet to see who could drink the most beer and still drive.
Peter, it sounds to me like alcohol is a very destructive influence in your life.
Just a bunch of losers telling boring stories. My drinking ruined my marriage. My drinking ruined my family.
I see you got your own thing going on this week, but there's a new teacher at preschool who deactivates the camera and then hits us.
She slams us into the monkey bars, but none of us have the language skills to call her on it.
I sat here and listened to you bums the other day, and I got to tell you, I have never seen a duller bunch of pathetic bastards in my life.
I don't know who you were when you were drinking, but it sure as hell's got to be better than who you are when you're sober.
So I did... So I just put my thumb over it, and then... And that got me through the rest of... of the... of the session.
We are gathered here again tonight, fellow AA members, to talk about the greatest temptation the Devil ever created:
One time, I took a liberry book out, and I fells asleep reading it, and I left it under the bed.
I was going to take it back on Amnesty Day, but on Amnesty Day, I had a sip of rosé wine, and I never made it out of the house.
This poor gentleman used to speak in long, eloquent sentences, but after years of drinking, he can only speak in short, choppy utterances.
Why, at one time, if you asked him who his favorite musicians were, he'd say Leonard Bernstein, Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Should we take this party to Denny's and hang out with the cast of the high school play?
I'll crank the heat, roll up the windows and blast the Lullaby Channel. I'll be fine.
Look, I've been told I can give you another chance, but there's some things we have to do first.
Peter, I'm going to show you where your life is headed if you keep drinking as much as you do.
Well that... That was a good idea you had dunking your hand in the toilet.
Everybody line up for a triple H: a hug, a handshake or a high five. Your call.
You members of the human race have the ability to send a man to the moon and make Justin Long a movie star.
With that kind of willpower, don't you think you can learn to put the bottle down just sometimes?
You can create an entire world right before your eyes and watch it come to life.
Thanks for showing me how to do it and being so nice to me, Mr. Gutentag.
You know, Chris, seeing a young person like you enjoy puppetry makes me so happy.
Look, if this is about those droppings in your yard, it was, uh, uh, Brian.
At first I wasn't sure it was him, but I got a closer look, and now there's no question in my mind.
I was a young Air Force pilot assigned as part of an escort for a bombing raid over southern Germany, when we encountered the Luftwaffe.
At first we thought we were in the clear because the Germans were frightened by the scary shark face on the front of our plane.
Most of the surviving American pilots were taken to POW camps, but for some reason, they thought I was gay, so I was taken to a concentration camp.
Y... You know, maybe we should just invite him for dinner and clear this whole thing up.
Yeah, he doesn't talk, but, uh, he's a chipmunk, and he's Scottish, and he would back me up on this.
Clean your pool with my shirt off, or wash your car in jean shorts, bend over in front of you to get little bits of lint out of the rug?
Say, listen, my wife and I appreciate how nice you've been to my son with all the puppets and whatnot, and, uh, we wanted to invite you over for dinner.
Mr. Gutentag, I'm sorry to bother you, but Chris and Peter didn't come home last night.
Now we can't fit through the window, but maybe there's some way we can let people know we're down here.
You know, I gotta say, Chris, all my life I wanted to see you locked in a basement, but now that it's happened, all I want to do is get you out.
And I'll tell you this: only one of us is gonna walk outta here alive.
Sometimes the only way to really appreciate what you have is to see what life is like without it.
Hi, Lois, um, I hate to bother you, but I'm going out of town for a few days to visit my father in the hospital.
I was hoping that while I was gone, you could look in on Susie and Joe.
And... And I said Rachel Maddow, and she kind of took the baton from there and said Meg Griffin.
Let me just get this little guy assembled. â™ª Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doodie, doo. â™ª
I mean, when was the last time you tried to blow something up, or take over the world, or even used the phrase, Damn you?
Well, I don't care for your tone and I'd say you deserve a good kick in...
Well, Brian, I thought about what you said at the park, and I've decided you're right.
Come on, help me get some of Peter's tools out of the gay-rage. ...97, 98, 99, 100.
That Puerto Rican street gang give you any trouble on your way home from school?
Yeah, you know, it's like we handicapped people say: When life ruins your legs, you just gotta make legonade.
You know, sometimes it's really hard being me, and I guess I just make Megonade.
Most times people just drop me off a block away so they don't have to be seen with me.
Oh yeah, I just wanted to make sure you got a nice hot breakfast before you head off to work.
If he doesn't say anything about me calling him Joe, that means we're truly in love.
Look, I don't know what's going on here, but don't be throwing things, because that's just not safe.
If I can decode the genetic puzzle of this being, perhaps I can determine how to apply it to my own neurological makeup.
Oh, yeah. Susie spit up on me, and I didn't want to go all the way home, so I just threw this on.
I was just calling to tell him my father is recovering well and the doctors say he'll be fine.
Listen, I don't know who this is, but you better cut it out! I'm a cop, you know!
I wouldn't have created Evil Stewie, he wouldn't have escaped and we wouldn't be trying to track down a murderer.
And I don't really know how to break it to you, so I'm just going to come right out and say it.
You're taking care of him and you're feeling a closeness that you're misinterpreting as a romantic connection.
Look, Meg, I do care for you, but I care for you like I... I would a niece or a good friend's daughter.
Don't. I'm lucky to have you as a neighbor, and even luckier to have you as a friend.
We interrupt this program because I have had kind of a crap day, and I know all the station passwords to do it.
Okay, our top story tonight: A local car dealer has announced a Hands on a Hard Body promotion in which a used dirt bike will be reward... awarded to the one customer who can successfully outlast his competitors.
Peter, why would you want a used dirt bike when you already have a car?
And the lucky one of you who can keep his or her hand on this dirt bike for the longest amount of time will get to take it home!
Okay, everyone who wants to win this dirt bike, come on up and put a hand on it!
So I decided to win it for myself just so I could destroy it in front of you.
No, Lois! I will not allow you to look down on Amber just 'cause she goes to an alternative high school!
Fact is, she rumpled up some poetry she wrote and threw it away in a fit, but I un-rumpled it, and it was really good!
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem, performed this afternoon by Peter Griffin and his dirt bike.
By the end of that pack, you'll be smoking like a real pro. Like a cool kid.
Kids, I'm sorry to say this, but I think the two of you need to be punished.
You know, I don't think you kids appreciate how hard your father and I work to provide you with everything we do.
Now, when you start bringin' in a paycheck and providin' for this family, then you can make the rules!
Oh, apparently, Chris and Meg are switching places with Peter and Lois for the week.
Wow. You know, I gotta say, when your dad told me about this whole switching places thing,
Well, you're gonna be sore-y when we put you in the hospital for free, eh?
Poop on a plate would be good, because at least there'd be traces of my food still in there.
I did it in like an hour. I don't understand why you're such a freakin' martyr all the time.
And Angela even told me I might get a raise for doing such a good job.
I bet you Lois Griffin doesn't make the track team, which is an important thing in high school right now.
Yeah, and I bet she also doesn't live on the south side of town, which is suddenly important.
So let's just put things back the way they were and just forget all about this, all right?
Seems like you don't have a choice but to let Chris work at the brewery until Peter finds a new job.
I guess it could take Peter a long time to find a job in this economy.
Can this day get any more stressful? Wanted: Muscular man for discreet pushing and pulling.
If I could come home and have five minutes before you jump all over my back.
I just heard all of that, and I just wanna say this family is (bleep) disintegrating.
Oh, hey, Chris, by the way, the roofer came today while you were at work.
I'll bet if I go upstairs to that bathroom that toothbrush is as dry as a bone.
What... What the hell is it with that school that every time you walk in there somebody wants ten dollars?!
Look, I... I'm really sorry, but if we're that desperate for money, isn't there something we can do?
Like to see me walk next door, hat in hand, and ask him for money.
No, you know what? Instead, let's just go knock on all the doors of all our neighbors and tell 'em I'm a failure!
Let's just go right now and tell everyone how much of a failure I am.
Oh, it's all our fault. We never should have let you take on the pressure of being an adult.
I guess what we all learned is that no matter who you are, or where you come from, life is a terrible thing.
Yeah, but if you got your family to help you get through it, it's not quite as bad.
Well, I had a third one, but it got ruined at that wine tasting at Michael J. Fox's house.
Now, we were going to show you the actual scene, but it... It would just make us all sad.
See, he has this disease, and it makes him shake a lot, and what with all the shaking, he spilled his wine all over my shirt, and my shirt, uh, was ruined.
I don't... You'd think Tracy Pollan would... Would be in charge of the checkbook, you know?
I don't, I don't think he's got the leverage to Rita Wilson her around town anymore. I mean, I... I... That's...
Peter, I have been going to Mr. Washee-Washee for ten years, and I am not finding another dry cleaner.
Now we are going to invite him over for dinner, and you are going to apologize.
Oh, yeah. I went to the first part of that, but then some fireworks went off and I ran for two miles straight.
Um, hey, listen, you know, I've had such a great time hanging out with you, and I was thinking...
Well, you know, listen. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for yourself, why don't you take Quagmire's class on picking up chicks?
You know, if you ever want to get anywhere with this girl, you gotta ditch that negative attitude.
No! You want to know how many times I've been laid since last night? 60!
You know, I came here 'cause I thought I'd made a mistake by not giving you a chance, but it's obvious you're just another typical jerk.
All right, let's see what you guys have done to make yourselves look like douchebags.
You're teaching us all this crap about how to get women and it's all a bunch of bull!
I came here 'cause I wanted to get Denise back and instead, you ruined my life!
But then there's that one... That one woman who's as amazingly perfect as Massive Head Wound Harry.
That's why I keep trying to figure out how to bring you back into my life.
If this is the kind of joy the '80s has in store for me, I'm ready.
But if you ask me, she got lucky, because now she's dodged the bullet of being in a relationship with a loser like you.
Well, you know, it's been so many years, and I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd just drop by and say hi.
I always knew you were low, but you're nothing more than a back-stabbing, junkyard cur.
Listen, Brian, I... I've been a real heel, and I'd like to make it up to you.
Um, he showed up at my door and said he was a Federal Boob Inspector.
But then he started saying things to me that my father might say if he were still alive, and I knew I liked him.
Did Brian ever tell you he once had a tick on the back of his neck that he couldn't reach with his mouth, and it swelled up to the size of a ping-pong ball?
Well, it was still smaller than that thing you had on your lip for three years.
Oh, three years? You mean like the three years you have left on this planet?
Hey, if you guys are so close, maybe Jillian should know that you teach a class in picking up women.
Maybe you boys will get it together someday, but it looks like that's all you are: Boys.
Hey, you know, may... Maybe it took us stealing each other's girls to finally become friends.
I'm just saying that if you read somewhere that Gwen Stefani was a grandmother, you might not even bat an eye.
Your Aunt Carol's going to be staying with us for a little while, so she's going to need your room.
Now, just don't use it to comb your hair and make promises to women you won't keep.
She has such low self-esteem that every time a man shows her the slightest glimmer of attention, she rushes into something serious and gets her heart broken like a teenage girl.
Uh, Carol, given your present situation, it's possible that dating might not be such a good idea right now.
Me, too, Carol. That was a great idea you had, about walking parallel to the water.
And I want to have a million more, every night of the week for the rest of my life.
Look, I know I have a bit of a checkered past, but I believe in love at first sight.
Well, what we're discussing is whether or not marriage is a smart move for Carol at this point in time.
'Cause if you say Beetlejuice three times, then Beetle... Oh, that was a close call.
We bonded over the Red Sox one time, and now he's got to bring it up every time I see him.
Now, you got to feed 'em every two hours, and I fed 'em an hour ago.
And then there was your third husband, Doggie Daddy, but you couldn't make it work
Do you have any idea how difficult it is for me to see my ex-husbands?
This is the kind of pain I'm trying to spare you from experiencing all over again.
Look, I know you're depressed about Mayor West, but I promise you made the right decision.
I guess I just better go call all my friends and tell them the wedding is off.
My parents may have been against our relationship, but a lot of people supported us.
Well, that's what I tried to tell you, but you were as stubborn as a pigeon at an ad agency.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, these are all good ideas, but I think what people really get excited about is dropped museum popcorn.
I never even heard of this place an hour ago, and now everybody's flying there.
I made nine mistakes, and I was afraid that I was going to make another one.
Hey, you know, when it's your turn to say, I do, you should say, I do the Dew, and then... and then we both pull out a Mountain Dew, and then I'll... I'll... And then I do, like, a radical skateboard jump off the altar.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
I know I've said that before... a lot of times... and it's always blown up in my face.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
You-you would take the magazine and you'd put it on the floor and pee on it 'cause you're a dog and you're stupid, and-and you have a weird toenail halfway up your elbow.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
We chose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.
Yeah, if you could just grab some rocks, Neil, throw 'em in a bag, we'll get you home safe and sound.
Hey, you remember a few months ago when you scored that date with that Victoria's Secret model and then ended up sealing the deal?
What? Well, the return pad works by first locking onto our coordinates along the curve of the space-time continuum.
It operates according to the laws of physics, but we're outside the space-time continuum, so there are no laws of physics-- watch.
Well, if I overload the return pad's reactor, it might release enough energy to blow us back into the universe, but it's too risky.
And if you don't, I am gonna spend the rest of eternity chuckling at a joke that I am not gonna share with you.
Yeah, the theory that the universe started with a massive outward explosion from a singularity of infinite mass and infinite density.
The universe's cosmic background radiation, a kind of echo of the big bang, precisely matches the energy spectrum of my return pad!
The universe created me, so I could create it, so it could create me and so on.
Oh, just a little of the good stuff for a new time machine return pad.
You know, it's funny, I had actually stopped playing with that toy, but now that I see you with it,
I wouldn't be there to be accidentally thrown outside the universe and subsequently create it.
Yes. Unfortunately, Bertram took the return pad with him, so we'll only get one shot at this.
Now we'll have to travel back in time to a point shortly before Bertram's arrival.
Ah, you're forgetting I initially encountered Bertram as a sperm in one of the fat man's balls, so he couldn't get rid of the fat man or any recent ancestor on my father's side.
Bertram had to go back enough generations to make sure he was snuffing out the ancestral source of my genius without affecting his own.
Yeah, no, I-I got the metaphor, but, Bertram, if you erase me, you'll destroy the universe!
Brian and I were trapped outside the space-time continuum and the only way for us to get back was to overload my old return pad!
So if you kill me, you're killing yourself and everything else that ever existed or will exist!
All right, I'm going to send you back five minutes after we disappeared in the time machine.
It was left to us by Leonardo da Vinci himself, with instructions that it be delivered to you on this exact-a date at this exact-a time.
It's been a week since you left, and I'm pretty sure I've set things right.
So I've built a cryogenic stasis device, and am placing myself inside it, leaving instructions for it to be buried in very specific coordinates in what will be future Quahog.
Oh, well, shortly after you left, da Vinci's girlfriend showed up, so I injected her with my DNA.
I put a sample of my DNA in a syringe and I injected her on the staircase, the couch and the balcony.
Mas onde estão os bons But where are those good- e velhos valores Old fashioned values-
E agora voltamos a apresentação exclusiva do Disney Channel. Aladdin 5: Jafar responde o Censo.
Sei lá. Digo, quem vai colocar as 3 revistas empilhadas bonitinhas na mesinha de café?
Lois, eu sei que está animada por viajar com a Bonnie e tudo, mas eu posso não ter que ouvir sobre a viagem quando você voltar?
A seguir, nosso velho e horrível repórter Ken Redowski se enfurece com um produto que você nem liga.
Todo ano, a mídia idiota tenta nos assustar com essas coisas, e todo ano, acaba não sendo nada.
Se ainda não está assustado, aqui tem uma montagem de pessoas espirrando em um balcão de saladas.
Enquanto a James Woods High continua aberta, estudantes devem lavar as mãos frequentemente e atentar para os primeiros sintomas da infecção.
Agora deixe me te dar um banho inapropriado e pessoal enquanto eu fumo e o proíbo de ver seus pais.
Chris, Meg, falei com seu pai no telefone, que me disse que precisavam ser removidos da escola.
Não acreditei que era ele mesmo de primeira, mas aí recebi outra ligação da mesma pessoa que achei que fingia ser ele.
Isso aí, sei que estão acostumados com professores usando ternos e capas do Drácula, mas esse não.
Eu sei que alguns professores pensam que aulas devem ser um exercício de estrutura, mas não o Sr Griffin.
Não acredito que vai jogar fora todos os anos com o Joe por um caso bobo.
Olha, nenhum casamento é perfeito, mas Joe é o homem pra quem você deu sua vida.
Querida, tenho que ir à cidade comprar mais suprimentos, então provavelmente vou morrer, mas se não acontecer, te vejo em 18 meses com um saco de sal e um jarro de gordura de baleia pras crianças.
Não sou bom em matemática e nem certificado pra dar aula de direção, então contratei um tutor de matemática e um instrutor.
Bonnie, se eu fosse um gambá e você fosse uma gata que vagasse repetidamente em áreas com tinta fresca, eu olharia a listra nas suas costas e pensaria que fosse outro gambá.
Te convidei pra essa viagem pra você aproveitar enquanto eu transava com estranhos, e é assim que me agradece?
O surto de febre de bode na escola acabou e honestamente, receio que não estamos aprendendo nada.
Entendi. Sabe, eu achei que diria algo assim, e é por isso que liguei pra alguém que talvez te faça mudar de idéia.
Prometo que leva 3 anos com esse sotaque antes que perceba que sou apenas outro babaca.
Bonnie, não achei que chegaria a esse ponto, mas vejo que só resta uma maneira pra eu provar meu amor por você.
Aquele lugar é só caras magrinhos, se esfregando em ônibus e metrôs, te cutucando na coxa com a coisa deles.
I mean, we're in a galaxy far, far away, and we still have to change in Atlanta.
Remember how last time they skimmed along a trench and then blew it up by shooting through a hole?
As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift, these two droids.
Well, I guess the good news is we're not being pushed into a giant anus in the desert.
It's part of the hibernation sickness. That and these lesions, and the fatigue that I've been feeling, and the persistent cough.
Threepio, please. Whatever you have to say cannot possibly be as important as this conversation.
There's a huge monster down there, and if Jabba hits the button, the trap door's gonna open, you're gonna fall down into the dungeon below
The mighty Jabba has decreed that you are to be thrown into the Sarlacc pit.
There, you will discover a new meaning of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
But, should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
They kind of just dropped him on me at the last minute. I couldn't say no, man.
There is one thing, though, and I'm sorry about this, but your room's not ready till 4:00.
Yeah, it's either Darth Vader or Paul Reiser, but they don't want to know which one is your real father, so they're gonna raise you together.
I'm getting really old and I'm not feeling so hot, and I think I might die soon.
Hey, just for giggles, you wanna poop in Yoda's tiny toilet, pretend he took a giant poop?
I'd like to thank you all for meeting me here, in the lobby of the Mondrian.
The Emperor has made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.
General Solo will take a stolen Imperial shuttle and knock out the shield generator on the fourth moon of Endor, while General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the squadron to destroy the Death Star.
Come by and apply for your Han job, and I'll get you off and running.
Well, just make sure you are. That ship's gotten me laid a bunch of times.
Well I just wanted to let you know there's a rebel fleet massing at Sullust, and I think they're going to invade or something.
It's of no concern! The rebellion will soon be crushed, and young Skywalker will be one of us.
I don't know. I stepped on it earlier. It was just here in the woods.
That's funny, because my friend lost his horn on the forest moon of Endor last year.
Yes, well, the thing is, a small rebel force has landed on the forest moon, and my son is with them.
No, no, Kurt was just a guy I was hanging around with for a while.
Just some guy to, like, play ball with, and go to the movies, crash into real hard in the hallway.
Hey, maybe we get out of the woods before nightfall, on account of the ghosts and all.
No, Chewie, don't! If you talk to her, you have to talk to her mom!
Tell them if they don't let us go, you'll become angry and use your magic.
So, they use spears with wooden shafts and stone-carved tips, yet they clearly understand the finer points of cosmetology?
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE) ...most of my days 'maxing, relaxing all cool b-ball no good trouble... neighborhood one little fight scared auntie and uncle in Bel Air.
Now listen, since your mom's out of town and I have you for the weekend,
I thought it would be fun if the Emperor and I turned you over to the dark side of the Force.
When we arrive at Endor, we will destroy the Death Star and then begin setting up the Ewok reassignment camps.
I say when we're done with this, we go over there and fry him up in a skillet.
I thought you should know, young Skywalker, that your friends are walking into a trap.
Silence! You will turn to the dark side, and your precious rebellion will be destroyed.
All right. Now I want you to take off your helmets, go outside and dig your own graves with them.
Shut up! There's enough cutesy crap in this movie. l think we all need this.
Shut up! And after he's dead, cut off his face and wear it as your face.
And then go home to his family still wearing his face, and see how long it takes them to figure out that it's you and not him.
Wow. What a voice! Do you mind reading this for me? Paging Mr. Herman, Mr. Pee-wee Herman.
Come on. Take that lightsaber and try to strike me down, and your journey toward the dark side will be complete.
What, because of Seth Green? Do you ever hear anyone say, Hey, let's go see that new Austin Powers, Seth Green's in it?
Oh, my God! I meant to hit you in the shoulder, and that whole thing just fell!
I don't know. He was up there like, I can't do this, I threw the thing, and I just meant to hit him in the arm, and then the whole thing fell.
Okay, now you're in a laundromat, and there's only one available machine, and you're fighting over it. Go!
And you gotta hand it to Seth Green. I mean, he works hard, you know?
I mean, the work is much harder when you know the project is no good.
Can we at least put together a press release that says I'm resigning of my own accord to pursue other evil projects?
I'm so delighted that Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen took the time to teach you nice manners.
Hey, Leia, you got a date for the We Just Killed Thousands of People Dance tonight?
What's going on, Lois, is that this girl is obviously not well, and I have just learned that she's been stealing from the show, and she should probably be escorted out of the building.
Why do you think we waited so long to take you to the groomer's last month?
Like it or not, we're going to have to start living on a strict budget for a while.
Would you be saying that if the prize was 150 million bags of the neighbor's garbage?
We're here live in our studio where a checkout girl in a cheap dress who wants to be a model is ready to draw the winning numbers. E!
A static shot of the house where night turns into day or a montage song that over-explains what we're doing?
Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank where the Jewish guys can leer at it?
I'm going to get a floor mirror to squat over and see what's making all that noise.
We're not going to go crazy spending our winnings, and we're not going to let this money change us.
I just bought a giant room full of gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck.
I told Angela what she could do with that job, just like I always fantasized.
Angela, I just want to thank you for several extremely pleasurable years working for this corporation.
Uh, certain unexpected developments have created a situation where I am no longer in need of employment.
Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk.
Hey, what's the point of being rich if you can't share it with your pals, huh?
Tread water where you are right now or increase your net worth fivefold within the next
Well, my friend Marty is a whiz with chemistry, and he says he's come up with a new penis enlargement pill, and if we can bankroll him $100,000 in startup money, he'll triple our investment in a year.
Bonnie's birthday is coming up, and I'll be gol-darned if I didn't go ahead and promise her that Stevie Nicks would come to our house and sing three songs to her.
Yeah, if you're going to open your mouth with the missus, stick to kisses, huh?
I-I just wrote you guys a couple of checks, but no, you... you-you-you do your things.
You know, especially when one friend gives the other friends a whole bunch of money.
Good. 'Cause what I want to do is stay here, get drunk and watch TV.
Hey, Peter, you wanted me to watch the entire first season of True Blood and come show you where there was boob?
Okay, Quagmire, I want you to take the first bite out of this fudge pop, because that first bite is the one that really hurts.
Now, smear what's left of it on your face and look at me with your mouth open.
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do a synchronized duet of Makin' Whoopee while I shoot you with this BB gun.
Jerk? What kind of a way is that to talk to your friend who gives you money?
You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning, and she said you haven't talked to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.
What, here? Yeah, I had a giant mobile put in the sky so I can sleep wherever I want.
We don't have to worry about paying bills, we don't have to worry about saving dough.
I already watched it eight times, so I know exactly which part I want to blam at.
Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father, you will try to impress me, and I will remain distant.
And, Chris, try as you may, you will never be as good as your older brother who died.
Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea at the Park Barrington every single day.
Waiter, have the chef prepare a bucket of your finest caviar, and then give it a helicopter tour of the city.
And over there is the Rhode Island State House, the second largest self-supporting marble dome in North America.
Well, I'm sure a brief call to my accountant will resolve this to our mutual satisfaction.
Yeah, but on the bright side, if this hadn't happened, we never would've met Kyle.
You know, I'm still young enough you can drop me at the fire station, no questions asked.
Winning the lottery was the worst thing that ever happened to me and my family.
I thought being rich would solve all my problems, but all it did was make me forget what was important.
I don't expect you to forgive me, but if, for some reason, you do, you can find me in a cardboard box on the corner of Meeting and Thayer.
I guess it's only fair that I give you my percentage so you can get your house back.
All right, let's just go to different rooms and stare blankly out the window, saying nothing.
The National Weather Service has issued a Severe Hurricane Advisory, and is urging everyone to stay indoors for at least the next 36 hours.
(with Spanish accent): Hey, kids... if you have an open wound, get some dirt or kitty litter and rub it in there to stop the bleeding.
I figure we're going to be stuck inside f a while with this storm, so it'll be a fun way to pass the time. Okay.
I-I-I-I have a lot of friends who do it, and they're willing to do it around me all the time, because they know I'm so cool about it and I don't judge them.
Okay, I'm gonna sing the opening chase music from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
What if I started calling you a fat, zitty loser, who has no friends and smells like an old woman who has birds for pets?
Is it too much to ask to be treated with a little decency from my brother?
Maybe show me some kind of kindness by not jumping on the Let's get Meg family bandwagon?
Meg seems to think she's taking some kind of stand here that's gonna make us all feel like we're inadequate.
Geez, look at those two. They're goin' at each other like an Italian guy and a black woman.
NARRATOR: Having been officially challenged by her natural enemy, the black female prepares for combat by taking off her many rings.
Meanwhile, the Italian male looks around to make sure the other Italian males are indeed seeing what he is seeing.
Sensing the impending battle, a flock of Jews flies quickly away, as avoiding confrontation is their best chance for survival.
Look, the bottom line here, Meg, is that you're just taking your own problems out on everyone else.
The shoplifter, the drug addict, the porn star, the whore who let Gene Simmons and Bill Clinton go to town on her?
What's your point, Meg? My point is that with all the irresponsible, reckless, idiotic behavior in your past, that somehow, somehow you have the nerve, the arrogance to consistently and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings.
To... to be my guide, to help me navigate the difficult, confusing, and vulnerable journey to becoming a person.
You're my mother, and you took a child's trust and smashed it into bits in a 17-year-long mission to destroy something that you killed a long time ago.
Well, you know, I, I been sorta just hangin' back here, takin' all this in, 'cause I didn't think
I had a dog in this fight, but my money's on Harry Potter over there.
You have no education, you have no interests, you just do whatever reckless thing you want to do whenever you want to do it without regard for anyone else.
Oh, oh, and when you're not terrorizing the community with your impulsive escapades, you're being a total jerk to your family.
If someone in the outside world could see the way you treat me, you would be in jail!
You are a fat, lazy, abusive, blue-collar Irish Catholic dad who drinks way too much and barely makes enough money to support his family.
Your only arguable accomplishments are your kids, and look at us; we're a disaster. Eh, watch it.
Well, I don't like having to literally empty the farts out of your pockets whenever I do your laundry.
Then I could finally sleep in and not have to answer your stupid questions at 5:00 a.m.
You don't even like them! But you know I do, and you don't want me to have them!
You know, I've never confronted you on it, but I've often thought the same thing, Peter.
You know, that was, uh, that was pretty cool the way you finally stood up to everybody.
I mean, I, I meant every word of it, but... you saw what happened. What do you mean?
Do you think it's possible that... that this family can't survive without some sort of lightning rod to absorb all the dysfunction?
I mean, it-- it's not ideal, but it's an important piece that maybe it's just my lot in life to provide.
What? Mom, you're an amazing mother and all the things I said about you were out of anger, and I didn't mean any of them.
Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin. Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use.
You know, when we were kids, our mother used to sing a song when we were sad.
Come on, Brenda, a stupid nursery rhyme isn't going to wake him up, especially the way you sing.
And Jeff and I are happy to stay here with you for as long as you need.
Fine, then you call my cousin Terry and tell him we're not going to be at his karate recital!
Well, it wouldn't matter if you'd just pick up that night shift at the prison!
I know, it sounded like there was quite a ruckus going on over there last night.
You know, you don't have to stay with a man who treats you that way.
'cause of the punches and all, but it's just that Jeff's been so angry about immigrants.
They've been with me three days now, and all he does is beat her day and night.
And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but then they're always like, Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?
I mean, w-w-what happens if one of these nights, he hits her so hard he kills her?
It's like a surprise birthday party, but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves.
All right, well, first we want to thank you all for being here for Brenda.
Now, I know it's going to be a long day, but we're all here because we care about her very much.
So we're going to say a few things, and then you'll say a few things, and then we'll be done.
All right, so we're going to go around the room and tell you exactly how your situation has affected each of us.
Look, I know what you guys are trying to do, but Jeff and I are fine.
Please, I'd like to say something, if I may. Brenda, the fact that you are being abused has affected my life in the following ways: The sister that I knew and loved growing up no longer exists. The person I see before me now is just a punching bag. And I call you 'person' and not 'woman' because a woman is a strong, beautiful, vibrant creature. A woman embraces life. A woman makes choices to make her life better. Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff, proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse.
But you know, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days when a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his (bleep) ass?
I don't know what this cock-a-doodle-doo thing is, but it sounds gay and it sounds scatological.
Y-you think they ever suddenly wake up and realize the error of their ways and clean up their act? No!
What the hell?! Did you change the channel while I was going to get a beer?!
Here's a bunch of words in a row: because the economy's so bad, they've decided they're gonna shut down all the prisons.
Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes of kissing first or Eddie Izzard in drag, but he has a working vagina?
I'm just gonna point my gun straight at his head before he even knows what's going on.
You have to bring your friends out here with you to do your dirty work?
I'm taking Quagmire for a little ride, and you guys are gonna stay out here and freeze to death!
That's okay. You can keep 'em the way you had 'em so it covers your stomach.
Thank you. You know, if this Jeff was around more, we wouldn't have tried to kill you.
You know, if you had any balls, you'd put that gun down and we could settle this like men.
Yeah, we found this note he left you. Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you. I realized that you are too good for me, and you and our unborn child would be better off without me in the picture. Love, Jeff. P.S. If the cops ask, tell them that Joe, Peter and Quagmire were with you last night. If you tell anyone otherwise, I will come back and not only hit you, but I will murder you. And no one will care because you're garbage.
And you just added that part about Grape Ape. P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape.
I just k-kept looking at him in the eye and talking to him about my summer plans.
Yeah, except for having to sit next to that screaming autistic lady in the waiting room.
From The Proposal and The Change-Up and a ton of upcoming stuff? Yeah, that's me.
Well, believe it or not, they've decided to shoot my movie in Quahog instead of Newport.
I'm standing out here without a shirt on and my pajama bottoms are riding insanely low on my hips.
So I'm having this housewarming thing tonight, and I'd love it if you came by.
And that was Baby by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris, which means it's time to give away some Justin Bieber tickets.
I should try to win those Justin Bieber tickets just so I can, like, tear them up or use them to go to t concert.
I mean, they also said that people who pretend not to have heard of it are chicken.
Wow, you got a lot of catching up to do, and tomorrow night in the dark, huh?
You know, Ryan, most people take one look at me and just assume that I have plans, so I never get asked out.
Yes! Oh, my God, right now would be the worst time for you to tickle my lower abdomen, because it's so exposed 'cause I'm cheering.
We now return to the end of a depressing 1970s sci-fi movie starring a guy in a turtleneck.
Oh, I had to stop that last sentence in the middle because I was so surprised.
I- I was laughing at that funny thing you said at dinner the other night.
Well, I don't know, man, but the good news is, it-it doesn't look all that bad, Brian.
All right, I have covered for you plenty of times before, but not this time.
Yes, Pratt and Millwood eight-color pastel chalk will turn your patio into a tropical art studio.
But you'll have to pack your chalk because you're going to be staying six days and seven nights at your parents' house in Wilmington, Delaware!
Um, hey, thanks for taking me out to dinner, Ryan, but I got to say, this food looks a little weird.
I'm gonna be in so much trouble when they find out I wrecked Brian's car!
And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on the plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers.
For example, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around, watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but who after you told her of your intentions, said, Go get him, child, in flagrant disregard of all newly-implemented post-9-11 security measures.
And if you were considerin bringing a boom box to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs.
It's true. Last night we were at this restaurant, and he tried to gay kiss me.
Why would any man dress well, groom himself and lift weights just to sleep with other men?
Look, Ryan, you're a great guy and everything, but I don't like you in that way.
I mean, there are some things that I would do with you, but my heart wouldn't be in it.
I'm attracted to you in the way that a man is attracted to a woman, but I'm not gay.
When you live out in Hollywood, you learn that life is about different spirits and energies you meet along the way.
I could never really be attracted to somebody who uses labels like gay and straight.
Look, I thought about it, and to be honest, it's probably my fault for leaving you alone in the car.
You know, when you were born, the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
Just make a mental note of where you buried it, and as soon as we're back in the present, you can dig it up then.
I mean, I know we're not supposed to mess with the timeline, but should we call an ambulance?
Yeah, I mean, now, we just like return text messages and screw around and whatnot.
Will it screw up the timeline if my future pee goes in a past toilet?
I shall cleverly disguise this lethal plasma disruptor device as a tuna fish sandwich, whereupon I shall end that wretched woman's Draconian reign of tyranny!
The Stewie from the past has a lot more gadgets and things than I do.
Amazing. You can barely drive a car, and yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?
I found a way to convert it so it takes D batteries instead of uranium.
Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the sooner they'd, uh, catch their mistake.
Um, I don't know if this is a weird question, but... can I have some?
All right, fine. Tilt your head back, and I'll lean my liquid down into your mouth.
Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times; he may even be downright, well, stupid, but I know he only accepted that money because he...
Our top story: Quahog prepares to unveil a new statue commemorating perhaps its greatest hero ever.
It was ten years ago that an almost inconceivable plot to destroy the World Trade Center was thwarted by Quahog's own Brian Griffin.
This amateur video captured Griffin's heroism in the face of a shadowy terrorist organization called-- holy (bleep), look at all those vowels--
The announcement came from former President George W. Bush, who reformed the Confederacy after a bitter loss in his 2004 reelection bid.
In fact, I bet, five years from now, the world will still be better off for what I did.
Well, Brian, if you're that sure of yourself, then let's go five years into the future, and you can prove me wrong. Fine.
You know, I just want to say how nice it is to be back here with y'all on Spooner Street.
Okay, maybe things seem a little off, but other than that, the world seems okay.
It says here that the new American civil war you set into motion ended up in a series of concentrated nuclear strikes all along the Eastern Seaboard.
Well, the only way to fix this is to return to the moment when we first arrived in the past and stop you from spilling the beans about 9/11.
Also, if you don't give that Stewie a back rub, it really messes everything up.
All right, you obviously have no self-control, so we've got to go back and do this again.
I can't follow what's going on anymore, and I'm assuming the rest of you can't, either.
What? What do you mean? I don't know-- one of them landed here with its throat slit.
But wait, if one of me is dead, then shouldn't all the me's be dead?
I've sent us back in time to the moment just before you and I originally arrived.
Just get back in your time machine, get back to the present, and stay there!
If I was successful in restoring the past just now, you and I will never have existed.
Every time you step into that machine, you invite the possibility of altering the world as we know it.
Thankfully, the alternate versions of us were there to prevent us from doing whatever it is we apparently did.
You might be sitting here with a hole in your leg, but at least our present universe hasn't been affected.
We've got some on-and-off drizzle here today, and we're a little w, as you can see, because, apparently, there are no awnings that exist anywhere.
Mysterious awning shortage ravages the Northeast, but miraculously has not affected Channels 2 or 6.
Okay, well, I guess it's broken, then, and there's nothing we can do about it.
'Cause his bum doesn't open up to poo anymore, and a nurse has to go digging up there to get up after his stuff?
Well, we're just glad we can have people over again now that that giant crab's gone.
It's been a year and a half, and he still looks uncomfortable around his dad.
Sorry. Just making mental memories for when you're all inevitably dead, and I'm left alone.
In some ways, Army life in Iraq is what you'd expect, what with the blistering heat, the constant sense of impending danger, and the one gay soldier awkwardly avoiding the use of pronouns.
Okay, well, just send Swanson's parents a letter saying that he's dead, 'cause those are already printed.
Hey, when you get sexually abused while you're in a coma, do you know it's happening and just can't do anything about it?
Hey, Kevin, you know I put a yellow ribbon on my car for you guys?
'Cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you guys. but I don't have any change on me right now.
Okay, now you eat up, and then we're all gonna go out back and play some Thanksgiving touch football-- excuse me: war hero Thanksgiving touch football.
(slurring): I work hard to put a cornucopia on this table, and you're out showing your lower ankle to every Tom, Tom, and other Tom in our village!
One-one time this homeless guy showed me his purple head, but looking back, I'm-I'm not so sure that that was really a military thing.
Wait a minute. I thought you said you flew straight home from Kuwait after you woke from your coma.
All it did was put me in a coma and kill one of my bunkmates and cripple the other one for life.
That particular strain of douche bag didn't arise until 2007, while you were supposedly in your coma.
And it's my second favorite holiday, right after Pretend Not To Notice People's Race Day.
But just looking down at his dead face and knowing that he lived near someone who worked with the dad of the kid whose name I never found out, I lost all hope.
But I walked away from an illegal war of aggression being fought 6,000 miles away from our shores.
And the war we started in Iraq has killed a half a million of their people, which is like 200 9/11's.
So, I guess those moments of silence we had at those sporting events meant nothing to you.
No, I'm just saying that blindly following orders has resulted in the deaths of millions of people throughout history.
Look, I think you guys are all rushing to judge Kevin without knowing what it was like to be in his shoes.
He saw horrific things, in a horrific war, that only one other person here could possibly come close to understanding: Ida.
And I'm sure that Ida, more than anyone else here, can understand and support the choice that Kevin made.
Son, when you go to war, you don't end up fighting for your country or your family or your flag.
I just came over to tell you what a great guy your father is and how hard he's been working for all of you.
You knew what your duty told you you were supposed to do, but instead, you did what you thought was right.
You know, I think they kind of figured that movie was going to turn out to be bigger than it was.
It was like a... like a tall guy in a black hat and a cape or something?
Big news out of Six Flags Columbus today, as they unveil what promises to be the largest roller coaster in the United States.
The ride has several Jewish groups up in arms... as they go over the first rise.
Yeah, if you want to ride that roller coaster, you're going to have to go on a diet.
Yeah, in fact, I got it right here. Today I ate peaches... ginger... honey... candy... olive... You know what?
And I'm not stopping till I look as good as my great Aunt Legs-Go-All-The- Way-Up Griffin.
Never had one, but somebody told me this is a really good way to start your diet.
Now no matter how many beckoning fingers that steam morphs into or how badly it tries to sneak its way up your nose, I want you to resist the urge to levitate off the ground and float towards the pie.
Peter, I don't understand why we have to drive all the way to Ohio to ride a stupid roller coaster.
Now remember, there are no rules about who can wear stretch pants here, so you're going to see some pretty shocking things.
He's probably off in a barn somewhere working on a contraption with that weird brother of his.
We do not see many of your folk in these parts, but we welcome all of God's children in their hour of need.
If there is anything we can do to make your room more plain, do not be afraid to ask.
A hotel in Amish country can't be any worse than staying in a youth hostel.
Uh, preferably one where I have to sleep with my bag taped to my body.
We have one where some Italian backpackers have laid out every item of clothing they own on all of the beds.
Uh, also, I'm going to have some mail delivered here, and I want it to sit in that box for four years.
Alas, there are times when I feel as if there is much of life I am missing.
You'd think they'd know it wasn't in their diet, but this is how they find out.
I'd try to talk to Eli's father for you, honey, but I don't know if it's my place.
The only member of our family whose word would carry any weight would be Meg's father.
Dear Amish Lord, thou looketh sternly down upon us thine flock, even though we did not do anything wrong and have been doing chores like (bleep) crazy, please make us humble, and deliver us more hardship, that we may get thick, calloused hands, much larger than other people's.
And grant that we become dull, like Eric Bana, who we have never seen, but are just going by reputation because it is your will.
We solemnly believe that although humans have been around for a million years, you feel strongly that they had just the right amount of technology between 1835 and 1850; not too little, not too much.
And protect us from those who laugh at our buggies or our hats and deliver us from mustaches.
Look, I-I know you guys are busy with your barn raising and all, but, um, you know, I just wanted to tell you how much my daughter Meg loves your boy Eli.
Plus, it is the time of the month when Eli's mother is on the burlap.
Now on another note, I notice you don't have a damn lick of music in this town.
I'm sure it's probably justified, but I'm begging you, don't punish the children for it.
Eli, I agree that your father was being somewhat unreasonable, but I don't think running away is the answer.
Ha-ha! I have done your chores to rob you of the joy of doing chores.
You have shown me so many wondrous things that have opened my eyes to the world beyond my home.
And I know just the place for us to go and blow off all this steam.
Well, I mean, you remember how a lot of people said, like, Oh, Ubama's not gonna be able to do it, but he's-he's hanging in there.
Gosh, Cleveland, it sure is great having you back at The Clam, even if it's just for a week.
Well, the numbers ain't so good, so we got to do everything we can-- Hello, Lois.
You told me you were gonna clean out those boxes in the basement and put them in the attic.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you want to buy some candy bars so we can get some new uniforms for our baseball team?
Now here we are, in the prime of our lives, and we're slaves to our women.
I don't know, like, maybe the four of us should do something to reclaim our freedom.
We don't know how long we'll be gone, and don't expect a call from us to check in.
We will drive after a couple of beers and not make a big federal case about it.
Would you rather be a hobo with a five percent chance of getting inherited by a rich guy or be Hitler two years before the end of World War II?
'Cause you know you're gonna have to shoot yourself, but you still got two more years as Hitler.
If you're the hobo, do you, uh, have a place to sleep, like an underpass or...?
As Hitler, can I change certain policies so that maybe I'm looked on more favorably at the end of the war?
Well, wait a minute, now how come I got to be crippled Hitler and he's still white Hitler?
These backwoods parts of the Deep South ain't a place you want to get lost in.
I read nowhere that Southern sheriffs really want to be talked down to by big-shot Northerners.
Front of the bus, back of the bus, middle of the bus-- you guys are doing great.
You will be worked harder than you have ever been worked in your miserable, pathetic lives.
Yeah, you knew it was gonna be hot when you heard that lonesome slide guitar and that hawk's cry.
You're my friend and everything and I feel bad saying this, but I wanted to see you fail.
Official prediction: when they let us out of here, we're gonna have to go through the prison gift shop.
We left Quahog to find adventure and get away from all those lame chores at home, but I'll tell you this.
Oh, hey, Warden, since it's our last night in here, can I have a glass of milk?
Look, sometimes in life, you got to say, What the hell, and just go for it.
All right, if we're gonna break out of here, we got to get past these guards.
I mean, I'm not saying I wrote something similar to it several years ago, but I am saying...
Some prisoners escaped from the work camp, and I'm helping the warden track 'em down.
I put in a call from the McDaniel's pay phone while you guys were getting that nine-piece chicken McFingers and those Diet Conks and those Fresh Fries.
Just 'cause you have a badge doesn't mean you can treat people any way you like.
And as a law enforcement professional, you have an obligation to be more ethically upstanding than the average man, not less.
Coming up, we talk to a man on the street while a man further back on the street flips you off.
I'm standing here surrounded by snowdrifts, stalled cars, and the one douchebag who wears a tank top every time there's a blizzard.
Guy at work drank a quart of motor oil once and didn't even die from it.
I was having fun playing in the snow, and now you've ruined it, like a pizza place ruins a salad.
Oh, and make sure to stick it right on top of the pizzas so it stays nice and warm.
No worries. Now I can work at Hot Topic and make people sick as I ring up their purchases.
The egg that I was supposed to take care of for my high school project!
Please, Joe, I know he had an accident, but can't you look the other way this one time as a friend?
Besides, you're always complaining that you don't have enough time to play polo or sit in a chair and moisten your mouth.
Oh. I mean this, um, redheaded lady who lives in my bed was a real pain in the ass this morning.
Yeah, all he ever does is ask you what you want to do so he can shoot it down and tell you what he wants to do.
All right, I just got to go take a misty, stop-and-go piss in your bathroom, then we'll be good to go.
I know, Peter, but he's my father and I don't know what else to do.
Well, we were just thinking, now that Daddy's retired that you and he might be happier in a place where you can be with people your own age.
Well, we actually brought you a few brochures of some lovely retirement communities in Florida.
Mm, this one's even got the word sunset four times in the name of it.
These actually look quite nice, and we could finally get away from these dreadful winters.
Reminds of that guy who was way too happy he didn't get killed on 9/11.
Look at that! I stayed up late watching Monday Night Football and that saved my life, huh?
Protect us, oh, Lansbury, from rude teenagers, from soup that is both too hot and too cold, and from anyone who calls, but please have people call.
Our state-of-the-art movie theater is equipped with some terrific innovations to cater to our residents, including a button on every seat that will pause the film whenever anyone has a question.
Well, we'll just need you to fill out this paperwork, and then we'll get you moved into your condo.
This guy worked and worked and never wanted to retire, even though it would've been the best thing for him.
You give me just one day to show you how great retired life can be for an old fella, and I'll let you honk the horn one time.
There's only one way to win this game-- wait for someone else to win and steal his card.
All right, Mr. Pewterschmidt, now, you know how in your building your office temperature was controlled by a central air system that you had nothing to do with? Yeah, I hated that.
Well, check it out-- this room has its very own thermostat that you can fiddle with.  Really?
Never thought I'd get used to the idea of giving up work and just devoting my life to leisure.
Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood, and I'm required by law to inform you that I am a sex offender.
We use the abbreviation S.O's because it saves a lot of time over saying Sex Offender, because that's all we talk about.
He sleeps 18 hours a day, he refuses to bathe, and he's stopped making any sense.
Aw, that sounds like the sad little fat girl who lives in all of us and is struggling to get out.
Don't you see, Lois? When we forced him to retire, we took all the challenge out of his life.
Margot, it's time to take this company in a new direction-- starting with being honest with the IRS about our profits.
And from now on it's against the rules to pat female employees on the fanny. ...like touching butts!
Hey, look, I-I got to go. I don't know if we're coming to Thanksgiving. Because I don't know!
You guys, don't you think I'm a little old for the Teen Choice Awards? I mean, I turned 18 today.
Yeah, ever since Fox pulled this contrived night of  out of their ass, in an effort to get in on the awards show business, it's been very special to you.
Plus we tally your text vote for the Biggest Whiff and Choice Bro-ment of the Year!
I thought you were gonna pay the kids from school to show up! I gave you $300!
Okay, the first rule of Jewish fight club is if somebody says, Ow, you stop.
No party? Oh, come on. I was gonna show a slide show of all those silly photos I took of Meg.
You got another member right next door if you ever want to talk and stuff.
So, anyway, I'm on approach into Lambert Field in some of the worst turbulence I've ever flown through.
I trusted my training, and brought the plane in safely, and in fact, it turned out, ironically, to be one of the smoothest landings I've ever made.
Well, gosh, Quagmire, this has been a fun night, but I guess, uh, you better be getting home now, huh?
We now return to Grainy Footage of a Potential Bigfoot that will surely spark a lively debate in your household.
Well, she may not plan on sleeping with him, but you don't know how smooth Quagmire is, Lois.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, we pumped your daughter's stomach and we found vodka, Rohypnol, a fair amount of DNA that is not her own and a class ring.
Me, too, Glenn. God, it's so amazing that you've been my dad's friend for, like, years, and now we have this connection.
Even a brick wall doesn't tell you they understand you, and then go do the opposite, you know?
You know, whether it's just that she's not listening or whether it's that she's making a conscious decision to defy your wishes, who can say, you know?
And I would say, in some respects, having a strong-willed kid is a good thing, but it can get frustrating as hell on the other side.
Look, Quagmire, you're one of my best pals, and I'm asking you not to do this.
I want to help you, Peter, I really do, but it's-- it's like you're asking a fish not to swim.
Oh, my God. I'm going to go poo now, so I don't have to later.
Well, now that you're with Meg, you don't need to be talking to, uh, Backbush anymore.
Oh, and I'll send a text to Possible Nipple Ring saying you're off the market.
Dad, I know what you're trying to do, and I want you to stop it.
This is a big game Meg is playing, and the only way to win is not to play it.
Oh, my God, I can't believe you knew about this and you let her go.
It's one thing to rebelliously flaunt an older guy in front of your parents, but it's a whole other thing to go away with him for the weekend to his sex cabin.
Look, everyone knows if you go away with a guy for the weekend and don't have sex with him, you're a huge bitch.
The reason being that you have sufficiently scared me away from your wife or daughter.
I know. I love the way the fire makes the shadows dance around behind us.
One time, my friends and I went camping, and nobody could start a campfire, and then I tried to start the campfire, and I could.
You may be an adult, but you're still my daughter, and it's my job to protect you from errant wieners.
So, I don't care how old you are, you're going to do what I say and get in the damn car!
I don't want to see your face knocking on our door for at least a month.
You know, Mom and Dad, I'm really glad that you kept me from doing what I was going to do.
I only wish I'd seen what was going on from the start, like your father did.
And of course the most important part of any workout is a proper cool down and a stretch.
So if I do this, I can talk about what a sweet rack she has?
Yes, but try not to make a boob-honking gesture with your other hand while you're saying it.
'Cause I got one in the pocket right now, and I want to know if I need to feel self-conscious about it.
So Abby, Elaine and Janet have their little lunch clique, and of course I'm not invited.
Well, I don't know, but what I do know is that in the staff meeting,  Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
It's ridiculous, and I support you fully. ...she told him the idea as if it was hers...
Uh, you're gonna start dating soon; probably good to get in the habit of chewing with your mouth closed.
The old ones were so rough, and Stewie got that splinter, so I thought replacing the wood was the best way to go.
Yeah, well, you know, I read somewhere that women decide within the first seven seconds if they're interested in you or not, so I figured I wouldn't waste anybody's time.
Well, I mean, I just don't know how much fun it is for a blind person to go to the movies.
I might be blind, but my brain has been trained to listen to any movie and know exactly what's happening on screen.
We now return to the first time travel movie with a perfectly functioning time machine.
Brian, if I ever take up roller derby, what do you think my name should be?
I don't know how she does it, but she dresses really well for a blind girl.
So I'm-I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna avoid touching her until a little more time has passed.
And by the time I tell her, I'll have impressed her so much that the dog thing won't even matter.
Most people would say, I lost, I give up, but you, you just keep trying.
Always killing the guy in charge and saying, Oh, this new guy, this new guy's gonna get it right.
Look, you can't expect to hire 60 workers to dig a cave under your house and then keep it a secret.
I don't care how many of you there are-- you're not taking this purse! Ah, the hell we aren't. Let's get him, boys!
We're all supposed to have dinner tomorrow night, and her parents are going to see that I'm a dog.
I made a nest of my old underwears on which to lay my eggs, and I shall raise my young in this room alone.
Have that sort of crème brûlée face going on now, but he saved their lives.
Plus he's the only one of my patients to never ask me for hand work.
I know we just met, but you seem like you're really good for our daughter.
I thought, if we got to know each other better first, you would eventually be able to see past it. See.
And I... I just... I really care about you, and I really want this to work, and I'm...
I could have gotten over the fact that you're a dog, because I really do care about you and I feel like we had a connection, but I can't get over the fact that you lied to me.
Brian, I know you're upset about what happened with Kate and everything, but I did have one more thought.
Well, since Kate is blind, you could probably just do a different voice and go out with her all over again.
There's a huge rock right there, and it's covered up by grass and there's no way you can see it.
But someone else could hurt themselves, and, and a small cut is a, is a death sentence in these times, so let's just, you know, let's... let's get these rocks out of here.
God, you know, I don't know why this guy's wife isn't here watching this stuff.
Yeah, I've been catching his library shows since there were only, like, three or four kids here.
Gosh, you know, our little Scotty seems to be having such a good time with your son.
He wouldn't be able to get to Cybertron because he lives in Eternia, and Eternia is in an entirely different dimension.
I don't know, I didn't read the whole Wikipedia entry, but the good news is that what he has is highly treatable with radiation first, and if necessary, chemotherapy.
We don't accept medical care for ourselves, and we don't permit it for our children.
Is that, is that that thing all them gaybo Hollywood actors do to keep their stuff away from other guys' butts?
Well, that may be, Meg, but that poor little baby has cancer, and they're just gonna take him home and pray over him?!
And maybe this dog will fetch a stick and bring me my slippers instead of prattling on about the pros and cons of various religions!
Peter, I have to go talk to the Jennings and ask them to reconsider getting treatment for Scotty.
During his 22-year reign, this French monarch known as The Spider King had an ongoing feud with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.
Look, I don't mean to question your religious beliefs, but as a mother, I just can't bear the thought of little Scotty not getting the help he needs.
Oh, really? So with this book from the 1800s, you can pray away paralysis or terminal illness?
I think you'll find that with God's love and a true belief, all manner of miracles are possible.
You know, Lois, this couch would be perfect for one of your red wine pass-outs.
Look, we appreciate your concern, Lois, but Scotty is our son, and we have to tend to him as we see fit.
We believe that the Lord is our Savior, and we remember Him by going to church and praising Him every Sunday.
We believe all the same things that you believe, but we go to church on Saturdays.
I know it's frustrating, Lois, but the fact is, there are no laws that say those people have to take their child to the doctor.
You could file a suit, but that could take months, and even then, there's no guarantee the court wouldn't support the parents' right to practice their religion.
How could we live in a country that would allow a sick child to die?
They made sure we all had a right to religious freedom, and it's my job to protect that.
Look, it's a nice night out, you're eating at a fancy buffet, the captain does his Al Pacino...
Then I could dip my head in brown paint and galumph around Europe looking for my hot daughter.
I'm talking about us going in there and taking that kid and getting him some help.
This underachieving, crime-ridden school is now fawn beige, thanks to guilty white people with no weekend plans!
It's kind of hard to breathe in those things, so I just dressed up like Harry Potter.
Come up and have sex with me some time. Van full of Peters who all have stern faces because they're about to pull off a heist?
Check. Upside-down Peter who isn't revealed to be upside-down until the camera spins around and shows that he is?
Check. Peter in an open airplane door slapping other Peters on the back as they parachute out?
Check! Super gymnastic Asian Peter contorted into a box that will be delivered into the house?
Okay, so I'll go get the baby, and while I'm doing that, maybe you do something about that snatchy tone.
But the whole-- All right, well, in any event, we now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.
Tom, I'm standing here with Mayor Adam West, with the latest information about the disappearance of young Scotty Jennings.
Well, we're looking for this child using all the latest technology, including the newest, most advanced multimedia milk cartons.
We're gonna get you to the hospital and get you the medical attention you need.
And when we get out, we'll still have the rest of our lives ahead of us.
I am standing outside Quahog Hospital, where accused kidnappers Lois and Peter Griffin have just arrived.
Also arriving is my overprotective boyfriend, who is suspicious whenever I am called into work at night, even though I've been a reporter for years, Tyrone.
I promise, when this is over, I'll gladly go to prison for the rest of my life, but not until I bring this defenseless child into the hospital to get him the treatment he deserves.
I know you don't believe in modern medicine, but you do believe in the power of prayer.
And through the years, when there was disease or infection, people of good faith would pray to God for a cure.
Well, then isn't it possible that penicillin, vaccines and antibiotics are all actually answered prayers?
And isn't it possible that the amazing men and women of medicine who brought about these miracles could be the instruments of God's answers to our prayers?
And if that's true, then I think it's wrong for you to ignore what very well could be the Lord's will.
I mean, what's the point in praying to God if you're just going to wipe your butt with his answers?
Well, I just got off the phone with Hope, and it sounds like Scotty's gonna make a full recovery.
I mean, wouldn't it be cool if you could pray really hard for something, and it actually happened?
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, and the reason I'm wearing this mask is because we've got a Make-A-Wish kid in the studio tonight, who, as you'll find out as the show goes on, is quite a cougher.
You know, Tom, I haven't seen you in a mask since you went under the stage name George P. Wilbur.
Did she... did she just say that George P. Wilbur was Tom Tucker's stage name?
That's the guy who played Michael Myers in Halloween 4, the greatest movie of all time.
I just found out that you were the guy who played Michael Myers in Halloween 4, and I just want to say,
I think that was the most brilliant performance ever in the history of everything, and I wanted to see if you would sign my DVD.
Well, I tried to make a career out there in Hollywood, but I just didn't realize how tough acting is.
The work I did manage to get was usually just bit parts that didn't last too long.
So, if you guys are a family, why are none of you the same shade of black?
I left Hollywood, moved back to my hometown of Quahog, and wound up working here as a news anchor.
Well, that's a nice offer, but I'm not quite sure how you expect to do that.
Well, you've brought me so much joy over the years as that lovable murderer of teenagers, and I want to return the favor.
All you need is some fake hair and a bunch of Hobbits hanging around you.
In a few minutes, I've got to be on camera in front of 800 people.
Our top story tonight: The Rhode Island Historical Society is heralding the arrival of a cast-iron, oak-handled
As I understand it, they would put the coal inside of that, and then put the object between the sheets.
Hi. I'm Peter Griffin, and at Peter Griffin Cadillac, we believe in three things: fair dealing, family, and friendship.
Because I know Tom Tucker could be a great actor, and I'm gonna help him make it happen.
You see, everybody needs just one person to believe in their dreams so they can spread their wings and fly.
Don't be silly, Tom-- you're an actor, and this is where you belong. Now, let's take some of this complimentary luggage and get going.
You just sit back and let your agent knock on every door in Hollywood till he gets you an acting job.
All the biggest Hollywood players eat here, and we just got to make them think we're one of them.
Yes, I will have the Big and Fancy, and my client here will have a bottle of your best steak.
Peter, I-I'm not sure what any of this has to do with getting me acting jobs.
Ah, then we best load our pockets with bread and get the hell out of here.
Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice your glasses, your poor table manners and your huge sense of entitlement.
Well, I'm the casting director for NCIS, and we need an actor for a mall role that shoots tomorrow.
You know, Lindsey, I just want to say how nice it is to have such a beautiful young woman in our home.
Eh, I'll think of something while I'm taking a chick dump in your parents' bathroom.
Lois, don't you think maybe part of the reason you like Lindsey could be because she looks so much like you?
And I think it's possible that your vanity has made you a little blind to that.
All you've got is a worn-out rope toy and that squirrel who comes by once a day to taunt you.
You know, Peter, I just want to thank you for all you've done for me.
Being a famous movie star entitled me to topnotch medical care not available to the rest of society.
My body was immediately taken to a Hollywood hospital, where I was hooked up to a 17-year-old ingenue.
And in accordance with Hollywood law, her life force was infused into me, bringing me back from the dead.
I don't get it. Why would a big shot like you want me for an agent?
But you put me and my family through a lot of crap over the years.
Peter, I need you to drop Stewie off at day care, and then shred this big stack of old bank statements.
You know, everyone said, Don't smoke during your pregnancy, but I think some of it rubbed off on him 'cause now he's cool.
Well, we're making a mediocre action film, and we think James is just the guy to do a serviceable job in a supporting role that Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum, and Craig T. Nelson have already passed on.
Tom, I... I didn't know how to say this to you, so, here, take this piece of paper.
And you're on in four, three, two... Peter Griffin drops Tom Tucker as a client.
I just met this and I can't decide whether to take her home or keep doing blow with Tom Sizemore and see if I can do better later in the night.
You're a handsome, kind-hearted, young man, and any girl would be lucky to have you in her life.
Now I'm gonna take the child filter off the computer, and I want you to have a fun night.
Peter, you've pitched me dozens of projects, and all of them involve me playing a hayride driver.
I need a drugs guy, a girls guy, a fitness guy, a guy with a boat who can dump stuff way-out-there kind of guy.
I dragged you out here, only to dump you when you needed me the most.
Tom, I think I speak for all of us here at Channel Five News when I say it's good to have you back here at half your original salary.
So head on down before the gays turn it into a cruising ground like they did the Barnes and Noble upstairs coffee bar, which they had to close.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker bringing you news you heard four hours ago on the Internet.
A ferry carrying a shipment of brand-new Mercedes Benzes from Germany crashed and sank just a few miles off our coast.
Thus far, the cars remain on the ocean floor as the Germans refuse to clean up the disaster.
You know, a lot of us here at Family Guy are, frankly, sickened by the sorry state of education in this country and how little you people read anymore.
Okay, that one might have been more of a visual, but you feel that feeling you got right now?
One was in a drawer all day. Wow, seems like Lois would've checked that stuff out before sending you.
Really? That seems weird. Yeah, and is it normal that Miss Emily tied us all to the sink while she went out to return a birthday present?
No, it's all right. We were just trying to get some of them sunken Mercedes.
Me and my mates, right, we was having a laugh sitting in of one of them, pretending to be people.
Say, you want me to try and get you one of those cars from down there, yeah?
Thank you so much! Hey, you know, if there's ever anything I could do for you...
Things ain't so good in America right now, which is why we're all so fat.
Oh, what happened to that kid? He fell off a stool trying to turn off Maury Povich.
Oh, yeah! I should probably go back in there, see how everyone's doing, I guess.
You know, the bit about If there's ever anything I can do, so, yeah... Oh.
And I should know, 'cause I went down on the floor, thinking it had to be a lot better than the couch.
Yeah. Well, it's just... would you mind tossing it up in the air for me?
Let me just put these bags away and throw some saltines in the yard for the kids.
Hey, I'm sorry, but Miss Emily and I have a connection, which is totally unexpected.
Say you like it, or she's gonna spend the rest of the afternoon out returning that stuff.
I know you can't tell this, but the one who's about to get her throat cut, she's sorta hot.
And, again, I'm gonna ask one more question, and don't take this the wrong way, but have you actually got a penis?
So then I'm reading the funnies, and right before I get to the last panel,
Billy blurts out, he goes, he goes, You know, those firemen showed up to get a cat out of the tree, but it turns out it's really Marmaduke up there.
Peter, in Billy's defense, the strip is called Marmaduke, and Marmaduke had not yet made an appearance.
I tell ya, he was fun at first, but now I'm not sure I can take much more of him living here.
Plus, the sooner we get him out of here, the sooner I can get back to my cocaine and dollhouses.
I finally stood up for all of us and told Miss Emily we should be given a proper lunch and not just what's left over from her Baja Fresh.
And she said I shouldn't raise my voice and pulled me really hard into the other room, and my arm came out of its socket.
I finally have a date with Miss Emily tomorrow, and I'm not gonna let you or anybody else get in my way until I have seen every inch of her naked.
Hey, uh, listen, Billy, it's been fun having you stay here, but we really need to talk about making some new arrangements.
'cause it dawned on me that the only thing better than you having one of them would be you having two of them.
Peter, I'm standing here on your front porch, hoping to kill that dolphin with this harpoon.
So the thing about dolphin lullabies is that they're all in the key of eee-eee! Eee!
I know, Lois, but I found out he's only here 'cause his wife kicked him out.
See, I'm gonna help Billy get back together with his wife, and then he'll move out and stop annoying us.
Look, Billy, I don't care what you or your fat friend here has to say, it's over.
It was just a dumb plan my buddies and I put together because we know how much Billy loves you.
He was nailed to a board and hung in a man's study as a novelty to sing funny songs.
You know what? I had to live on the land to learn there might be a million fish in the sea, but there's only one you.
Wow, Peter, you did a really nice thing helping Billy get back together with his wife.
Yeah, and the best part is, he's out of the house and back in the ocean.
How are we gonna find gauze and bandages in the middle of all this crap?
Uh, I think he keeps them next to the thousand-piece puzzle of a lobster trap.
I don't see it. You mean, next to the Kadima paddles, or next to the basic black sweatshirt with no writing on it?
No, I think they're over there between the rain ponchos and the cap guns and just below the balsa wood gliders and the net-bag of flip-flops and a beach pail.
Yes, above the jacks and the bicentennial playing cards and across from the giant cage with the beach balls, next to the Wiffle ball bats and the spark-spitting cars.
Yes, behind the plastic bag of Mexican soldiers from the Alamo and the Super Elastic Bubble Plastic.
She could get away with overcharging people, because they were always mentally undressing her and then re-dressing her once they saw the horrible mess underneath.
Well, look, uh, I don't know, maybe there's something we can do to help you drum up some business.
Okay, Mort, now, if you want to get more customers in your pharmacy, you're gonna have to do a promotion, like... like buy one, get one free.
Oh, 'cause it seems like you're saying the first part in English and then some kind of made-up pha-lumpf-phalumpf or something in the second part.
Let's say we're at someone else's store, and there's a sign, and it says: Buy one, get one free.
That's right, bring in the city folk with their big money and their long cigarettes and their dogs with shoes.
Grim details continue to roll in at this hour in the story of the detached airplane advertising banner which caused a school bus to plummet into the Pawtuxet River.
Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy made headlines across the country after a banner of theirs caused the bus to drive off a bridge, tragically killing all the teenagers on board.
You know, my cousin had the same problem, but he lucked out, 'cause his business burned to the ground.
Last year, after I lost my beloved Muriel, our life insurance company refused to pay on her policy.
They took what should have been a pleasant experience and made it into an ordeal!
A friend of mine staying in my house got, um, injured, and my homeowner's insurance wouldn't pay her doctor bills.
Yeah, come to think of it, they wouldn't even pay for the fetus Lois lost when we went to visit the Museum of Staircases and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.
And, look, as long as nobody sees us, and we don't tell anybody, then we're in the clear.
Yeah, but leave a little up front so I have something to play with. Sounds good.
Yeah, let's trim that. I don't know when that started, but let's get rid of that.
If we put it on the electric box and two of the outlets, then light them all at once, it'll look like a short circuit.
Just as a box of crackers is only as appealing as its least intact sleeve.
I don't buy your product with broken quarters; don't stick me with broken pieces of cracker, you miserable dicks!
Hey, Peter, what are you gonna tell Lois when she asks where you were tonight?
Okay, well... I'm sorry for your loss, but the good news is your insurance will be covering all of your damages.
All right, guys, all we got to do now is keep a low profile and not mention a word of this to anybody.
I want you to know that I'm going to personally go over all the evidence.
Roll away. No, I'm just saying, as your friend, I wouldn't feel right unless I left no stone unturned.
I think I know how to get him off the case once and for all.
Hmm. These burn ignition patterns aren't consistent with an electrical fire. Would... love to. Probably... about 7:00... or 7:30. Any... of... those places would be... fine.
God! No way! I don't know Probably just a collared shirt and jeans. Have you never been to... a restaurant before?
I'm gonna send it to voicemail, then call him back, but pocket-dial him while I walk a few blocks.
I've been giving it a lot of thought, and I think we all just need to confess.
If you start yapping to the cops, we're gonna rot in prison for the next 30 years.
Did any of you happen to be at Mort's pharmacy on the night of the fire?
It's gonna take a lot more than a fart in my face to make me...
Did you ever stop to think about us before you did something that could send you away to prison?
I was barely conscious on the operating table, but I'll never forget the phone call that changed my life.
Well, there's a new procedure that, if administered immediately, should restore his ability to walk.
The thing is, you guys committed a crime, and I've still got the evidence to prove it.
The now former mayor has given the key to the city back to the Huron Indian tribe.
But if you think you have what it takes to beat the best eater in the world, come down to the James Woods High parking lot this Saturday with $50 and a large appetite.
All right, Chris, if we're gonna pay the entry fee for that eating contest, we got to sell some of my old stuff.
If you get nervous, just picture the audience naked and slide those hot dogs down your throat.
I want to get 'em checked, but I'm afraid of what they're gonna tell me.
I told you not to take him to that eating competition, and you deliberately defied me!
And then he went into the kitchen, slowly opened the refrigerator, and it was empty!
So then, the man, weak with hunger, raced from the refrigerator to the counter to look for a delivery menu, but all he could find was one for a vegan place!
This one time, I was on a city bus, and the guy next to me was eating a bucket of fried chicken.
Well... I'm usually more comfortable around things if I can put them in my mouth.
Good thing there wasn't land or else you'd have to meet the natives with that mustard stain on your shirt. What stain?
I saw a forest like this in a book one time, and I know there's a gingerbread house out here somewhere.
Well, we clearly don't have all the evidence yet, but that's never stopped us before, right?
I guess he fits the profile, Peter, but Lois's brother is locked up in an asylum.
Wait a second, Lois, I want to go back to what you said about my patter singing.
Just this morning, a very nice gentleman opened my cell door and said I was free to go.
But first fix that notepad so it's at a right angle with the corner of your desk!
And tap that pile of receipts against a flat surface so they're not sticking out haphazardly!
All right, campers, until the Fat Guy Strangler is caught, everyone has to stay inside their cabins.
He's got plenty of places to hide out there and a fully stocked corral of victims.
I mean, who better to get inside the mind of someone who's strangling fat people than someone who's done it himself?
I could give you my wallet, but what I think you really want... is love.
You said the first victim was wearing a baseball cap, this second one is blond...
I don't know, but I do know that he's in a great deal of danger right now.
Wait a minute, Joe. That's the guy who opened the door to my cell yesterday and told me
That way, when he murdered Chris, it was a cinch that you would take the blame.
But La Vie En Rose is a beautiful movie about the real life tragedy of Edith Piaf.
Because you were supposed to be watching him, but you were smoking marijuana and he drowned!
Now, I'm gonna need you to squats down like your underwears is done for, but you might still save the jeans.
Well, for five dollars, you could get your picture in a fake newspaper with a humorous headline.
Look, Lois, I know you're mad, but I think this will prove that I did the right thing.
No longer will we be just those faceless nobodies who brought the bird flu to Quahog.
You know, there's something seriously wrong with a man who always puts his friends over his family.
He used to hang you in the garage so his fender wouldn't hit the wall.
Okay, okay, that was an extreme example, but face it, ladies, your best friends are not hot.
All I know is, I'm extremely important because there are drawings of me on all the bathroom doors.
All right, look, we know we woke up in the hospital, so maybe there was some kind of catastrophe that we were all spared.
Hey, you know, if we're all gonna be tryin' to figure this out together, maybe it would be easier if we gave each other names.
I bet I was a doctor who had to deal with a lot of serious stuff, but always found a way to keep things light.
Yeah, and I bet I answered the customer complaint line at a Danish cookie company.
I mean, t-they came in a tin, how fresh did you think they were gonna be?
I just hope it doesn't have one of those mailboxes that looks like a cow.
I have one of those mailboxes that looks like a cow. Moo, says my mailbox.
I'm gonna go shove my hand down my pants and see if that goes someplace.
Yeah, I mean, there's no pictures of me, but I see you've got a dog collar and a leash.
Turns out my name's Joe Swanson, and I found this police uniform in my closet.
Well, it's good we found out who we all are, but we still haven't found out what the hell happened to everybody else.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that, and I think the best course of action is for us to just go ahead and start repopulating the Earth.
There's a bedroom upstairs that belonged to some girl, and she's got bras in there, and the cups are different sizes.
Guys, you know how we were thinking that something must have caused this situation... or someone? Yeah?
I would kill everyone in the world and leave three survivors for a piece of pie right now.
I just took a bunch of random stuff I found in my medicine cabinet, and you're really freaking me out right now.
Not all of us. Somebody's gotta go over there and keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.
I thought it was a dog whistle, but now I'm thinking it's something you jam in your urethra to make you last longer.
Man, I wonder if I'm one of those secret assassins who doesn't even know it, but I'm a highly trained killing machine.
Hey, I know we're the only people on Earth and all, but what's with all these Mexicans coming here to steal our jobs?
You know, you ever think if we could all just spend more time celebrating our similarities instead of just standing on our differences, the universe would be a much better place?
We were just watching TV, but listen, you've got to believe me, he's not capable of hurting anyone.
Look, there's pretty solid evidence that this guy is responsible for the elimination of the entire human race, and we need to take him out.
But he trusts me, so you guys wait here, and I'll go lure him out.
When you've been a stripper as long as I have, you know when you've met a bad egg.
Well, I wanted to prove to you that I was right, that your friendship was purely a result of circumstance.
So I created a scenario in which everyone's memories were erased, to demonstrate that you and Peter would never naturally associate with one another.
Oh, well, you know, I guess I should be getting back to my dorm anyway.
Is this what your parents are paying all that tuition for-- so you can  dogs?
Well, Mrs. Griffin, you have three crushed ribs, but I was able to stop the internal bleeding.
And if he's not smothering me, he's keeping me up all night writing with that giant plume of his. Dearest Augustine, I do hope this latest damp has not aggravated your gray lung.
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. Matters stateside have taken a tragic turn as this year's gourd crop has fallen prey to a rather unexpected infestation of saltmarsh cutworms.
Lois, if God wanted me to not sleep with my wife, he would have made me John Travolta.
Believe it or not, men like to cuddle, even cold, unfeeling men like Charles Bronson.
I bought that to kill the women from Sex and the City, but time seems to be doing it for me.
Oh, my God, I've been dreaming about doing that for years, and you've actually gone ahead and done it.
I've never said this to anyone before, but I feel like I may have finally found, in you, my one true soul mate.
Men need someone to spoon with and snuggle with just the same as women, and when you don't have that, it-it's...
I would like for you to sleep with me in my bed, and this, this is not about sex; it's about sleep.
Right, I mean, who says that the body next to you has to be male or female or... whatever?
I know, which is why I just planted another bomb that's set to go off every time he burps into his hand.
We blew up the Great Wall of China, bombed the Eiffel Tower, a look at this note I sent off. Dear Pakistan, Up yours.
Okay, I have to destroy Copenhagen with a... tidal wave, and the theme is... the Roaring Twenties.
Look, Lois, I told you that I need to have somebody sleeping next to me.
Our top story: Authorities are still searching for the culprits in a series of horrific acts of destruction all across-- scroll down, guys-- the globe.
What the hell did you think I was talking about when I said, Victory shall be mine?
Look, in the past you've done terrible things, but it's always been about the pursuit of your greater goal of world domination.
I'm saying she's a bad influence on you, and you should stop spending time with her.
AXE Body Spray: Spray it on after gym class instead of getting beat up in the shower.
Look, Peter, if you come home now, we can get our old bed back, and you can snuge with me as much as you want.
Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
Oh, well, you know, I guess I should be getting back to my dorm anyway.
Is this what your parents are paying all that tuition for-- so you can  dogs?

Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
If you hate it so much here, why don't you come to Paris for a semester with me instead?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you would go to the dance with me on Friday.
Meg, I'd love to send you to Paris for a semester, but we can't afford that.
Say hello to the Pont Neuf for me, or as I like to call it, my inspiration point...
Oh, and please do not be suspicious that I am at the airport with no baggage whatsoever.
The apartment we're staying in is huge, Uh-huh. and has an incredible view of... Uh-huh.
I will never be able to find you, but what I do have is two dollars and a Casio wristwatch.
Ma'am, the men who took your daughter are most likely members of a sophisticated network of human smugglers.
Look, you're the only one who's got the know-how and the technology to help us track her down.
All right, I've booked us on a flight that leaves in two hours, so, um, whose credit card shall we put it on?
I'll-I'll put it on my card, but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift because that's the only way I can do this anymore.
All right, the first thing we've got to do when we land is check the apartment where Meg was abducted and see if we can find some clues.
Excuse me, do you mind if we switch seats so my family can sit all together?
You see, Brian, I record all phone calls coming in or out of the house.
The, um... the, passengers had, uh, just signed up for a tour of the harbor and then all that stuff happened.
You know, maybe it'd help if we just tried to track Meg's movements from the moment she arrived in France.
Yeah, but how are we gonna know for sure if these are the guys who took Meg?
We ask them what they want, and when they say Drakkar Noir-- which they all will-- we'll know if we have our man.
I hope you burn in hell along with the guy who came up with stuffing a turkey.
You just fit it in when you have free time, wherever you are, wherever you can.
All right, fellas, bring the lights up a bit, play the CD I gave you and let's do this!
This next girl is perfect for those of you who want to buy a sex slave but don't want to spend sex-slave money.
I always tell them, Put the prisoners in the jail cell, but they always say, Just chain 'em up to a pipe.
We were like Lewis and Clark and the guy who likes to tip over canoes.
Until now, walking to the other end of the United States seemed like such a good job.
I bought you for my son, and not to be his slave, but to be his wife.
Fair goddess, it is my hope that you will agree to be my wife, but the choice is yours.
Oh honey, we are so glad to have you back but you really don't remember anything?
I mean, one minute, I was being proposed to by a handsome Arabian prince, and the next thing I know,
Peter, I told you, I don't like all these strangers walking around in our house.
And if we don't show them we appreciate their loyalty, they're gonna go someplace else. For what?!
Not to alarm anyone, but some guy took me in the closet and tried me on.
Lois, I'd love nothing more than to sit here and chat with you, but I have a business to run.
It's dark; it's cold; and hooking up is just a crapshoot 'cause of all the big coats.
Just for Eagles will give you thicker, fuller, more natural hair... so you can just focus on eagle stuff.
Is it real or just another excuse for kids these days to forget their manners?
But first, thousands are expected for tomorrow's Tea Party rally celebrating their new Quahog headquarters.
The Tea Party has gained a sizable following based on their message of low taxes, limited government, and happy birthday, Tom...
Well, I'd like to be part of a movement, but what movement would want an angry fat guy with a lot of opinions who hates listening?
For more details on the Tea Party platform, we now go to this totally boss fireworks show.
I am going down to that rally tomorrow and I am joining the Tea Party!
Oh, wait, that's the same time as my men's knitting club, although they have been really critical lately.
I finally got something better to do with my Saturdays than sit at the mall and watch Japanese girls laugh at normal conversation.
Finally, I'm part of a movement of regular people trying to take back our government.
It's actually funded by Big Business types who are using you to get the government out of their way so they can roll over everyone.
Folks who are tired of big government and are ready to stand up for their rights.
And now, it's my privilege to introduce another regular, blue-collar guy, our Quahog chapter spokesman: Joe Workingman!
And the government wants to tell you you can't throw your old TVs into the river.
But you probably don't wanna join the Tea Party because all you get are these stupid, awesome keychains!
The same way the Village People ruined any gathering of a cop, an Indian chief, and a construction worker.
This is what Brian was warning me about: that the Tea Party is run by rich guys who are only out for themselves.
I could actually use a regular guy like you to help get our message out, and I know Joe Workingman agrees with me.
Oh, it was great, and now I know it's the right cause to get behind
Oh, of course, Carter Pewterschmidt, an industrialist with oil refineries in this city, is on your side.
Lois, I'm so glad you're done with the dishes so that you can hang out and chime in on this.
We're not covered by the lame-stream media, so we got to reach out to the common man individually.
Yeah, I can't wait to fire all them city employees, starting with that half-asleep construction worker.
Well, I'm nothing if not a public servant, and the public has made its feelings known.
Our top story: Quahog is now completely government-free, which means I'm free of all broadcast regulations, so no more trips to the bathroom for this reporter, just a big-ass coffee can under the desk.
You know, for years I've been sick of taking the roads home, so today I took the yards.
Man, getting rid of the government has been the best thing to happen around here in a long time.
Yeah, and now my Spanish teacher and I can finally hold hands in the halls.
Well, I'm glad you're all enjoying your freedom, but have you taken a look out the window lately?
If that gets past the bad neighborhoods and reaches us, that's going to be a big problem.
Historically, in instances of mass lawlessness, the first thing they do is round up the Jews.
The cops don't come, the toilets don't flush, and there's garbage piling up in the streets.
Not having a government worked great in Somalia, but somehow we seem to have botched it all up.
Now that we've freed ourselves from the terrible shackles of government, it's time to replace it with something better.
The first thing we need is a system of rules that everyone must live by.
I think that we should elect some people to represent us, and they should make rules and choices on our behalf.
Now, this may be kind of expensive, so I got a plan: everyone should have to give some money from their salaries each year.
Poor people will give a little bit of money and rich people will give a larger amount of money, and our representatives will use all that money to hire some people who will then provide us with social order and basic services.
'cause later we're going to have more elections, and we can use those elections to get rid of the bad guys and replace 'em with good guys, and then the system will just keep going on and on just like that.
A few years ago, we did an episode called Viewer Mail where you, our fans, wrote in and suggested ideas for new episodes.
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock, we wanna let you know we kicked around idea, Make the Baby Go Wild for a while, couldn't really find an angle on it.
Actually, Family Guy, much like The Office, is based on a British series called Chap of the Manor.
Again? But Neville, you spend all your time down at the Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.
The Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock is for tossers.
We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat and Bull and Whistle and Fiddle and Cock and Pig and Wolf and Carriage and Fife and Other Wolf!
Coming up: a man with a gun and two bullets has taken over the city of Manchester.
But first, our top story tonight: Her Majesty, the Queen, will be passing through our very town tomorrow.
The field is teeming with men in helmets who don't seem like they need helmets, and men not in helmets who seem like they probably should be wearing helmets.
My favorite part before the Queen arrives is yelling wanker at Prince Charles as he passes.
Well, I'm just happy our family is safe and sound back in our cozy row house.
Robin Williams has a manic gift that gladdens a sad world and all he asks in return is our unceasing attention!
So, somehow the lightning gave your dad the power to turn anyone I touch into Robin Williams.
Peter! Ho-ho! You pat my back, I pat yours, and Pat Robertson pats Mr. Happy.
All right, Rupert, all we have to do is act like Robin Williams, and he'll think we've already changed.
Yeah, wipe it off and put it back in your purse, you white trash hen.
Hey, kid, come here. I wanna see if I can still smell your mom's boobs on your mouth.
Now you play with your toys and I'll go get yo a nice, fluffy towel.
I'm swimming at night 'cause I'm a slut and now I'm paying the price for it.
You spent the last ten minutes parked in front of the house crying in your car?
I don't know if those things are puppets or they put costumes on dogs or something, but let's press play and find out, huh?
You can't get them things wet, by the way, but don't worry, this don't affect that.
A major drug bust in Quahog today as police seized over 100 kilos of cocaine.
That's right, Joyce. Apparently, there were 100 kilos of cocaine right here in Quahog, and yet my guy can't get dick.
It feels good to know that, thanks to me and my colleagues, a lot fewer people will be injecting cocaine into their penises tonight.
Thanks, Quagmire. I'll be honest, it was nice to be acknowledged by the chief for once.
So, listen, if you guys aren't doing anything later, the chief's throwing me a little party to celebrate my bust.
I don't know if I can take another evening of sympathetic eye contact from all the other wives.
I bet working here, she's one of those women who's tough as nails and good at giving sass.
Yeah, sorry, I was just thinking about... someone should have come tonight, but they didn't.
Well, under normal circumstances, you'd be right to say that, but in this case, cheating would be the only fair thing.
Well, I'm the only one who comes in here, so I figured I'd make it my own.
Why does Kevin always sit at the bus stop, but never gets on a bus?
The plane is sinking, so I need you all to proceed onto the floating slide.
Guys, am I the only one who thinks it's weird talking about Joe cheating on Bonnie in front of their baby?
Well, how do you think I felt when I found out you slept with that French guy, huh?
In my defense, it is my experience that I am generally correct about most things.
And I got earplugs so I could put up with that horrible voice of yours.
Does the Swanson divorce mean that I have to go live with Grandma and Grandpa?
Boy, I never would have seen this day coming when we first met. Africa by Toto was playing.
So I figure, all we got to do is find a way to recreate the magic of that night.
Thanks for inviting me to lunch, Lois, but why are we eating at a strip club?
Well, one of the dancers was dancing with a guy and saying, You're my favorite, you're my favorite, but now she's dancing with another guy.
Ross' wife was with him, and in fact, they invited us all over for dinner tonight.
But I'm gonna stare at his wife's boobs so hard that when they both go into the kitchen together, it will be discussed.
Yeah, I just got home from work, put down the lawyer's briefcase, and put on the chef's hat.
I mean, no offense, but it doesn't look like your family would be up to the task.
Yeah, we should call Ross and tell him, This is the hospital, and your mom's dead.
And we'll be like, Saint Up Yours, and then... and then that's, like, two jokes.
I-It's just, that guy really got to me, and I wanted to stick it to him.
Tell him I'm a pathological liar and that I've been under a lot of stress because of the child rape charges I'm facing.
You think I liked sitting there pretending to be polite to those people while they talked down to us like that?
Okay, gang, once we arrive in Nepal, we'll get all the supplies we need for the trip up Everest.
So when they walk up to you, quickly stuff a dollar bill in their mouth.
Okay, now, we got to make sure we've got all the provisions before we head up to base camp.
Okay, let's split up and meet in an hour in front of The Yak Shack.
And my mom is pounding on the door, and I'm like, Mom, don't come in here.
Lois, this is probably a terrible time to remember this, but I think I might have left the weed whacker on.
Hey, listen, on a scale of one to ten, how bad is the bathroom situation up here?
Like, ten is a suite at the Four Seasons, and one is a tied-up raincoat sleeve at a party in your honor.
Yeah, in fact, not only are we gonna climb it, we are gonna beat you guys to the top.
We are gonna beat you so bad, you'll think you gave Chris Brown an STD.
Getting to the top ahead of you is gonna be one of the greatest moments of my life.
Okay, the Fishmans are heading up the North Face, but I've been studying this map and I think we've got a better chance of beating them if we go up the South Face.
It's okay! There's a huge pile of dead bodies down here that cushioned my fall!
Hey, you know, I heard, when you drink at high altitude, it hits you even faster.
All right, everyone get into a hilarious pose, so when they dig out our bodies, they'll have a good laugh.
Yeah, but by that I thought you meant a set list of totally awesome tunes, which I do have.
Oh, great. Not only are we caught in this blizzard, but there's some maniac up here freezing people to death.
Look, if we don't eat something soon, we're all gonna pass out from exhaustion and freeze to death just like him.
Sir, this is just a piece of paper with the word south written on it.
Well, my gut tells me he'll be squeezing himself out of a crevice very soon.
I say we leave her behind and marry that hot new assistant from my work.
But we just let Ross and Pam walk back up there, probably to their deaths.
Plus, if we don't rescue the Fishmans, their Jewish god is just gonna sit there and make us feel guilty.
Now, few people realize that until 1928 there were no hoses, and you actually had to fight fires with your bare hands.
I want to see if there's a response to all those fan letters I've been writing.
You were a big deal in one thing, but you were wearing a mask for most of it.
Hey, there's something here from the Nielsen Company. Dear Griffin family, You have been specially selected from amongst millions of American households to be a Nielsen family, and as such, to have your TV viewing habits monitored in order to measure television ratings.
Well, Meg, it sounds like they want us to be part of a select group of people that helps determine what's on TV.
Now, this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
Um... this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
Is there any way you can describe that to me using colorful puppets of some sort?
And now the mug's so old that the P has been worn off so it just says B.S.
Yeah, can you end each show by trying to pull-start a very cold chain saw?
And as per the wishes of my moustache, his ashes were sprinkled off the coast of Acapulco where he was born.
If he did the news with a family of prairie dogs, and whenever he said something sad, they'd pop their heads up, all concerned.
People rely on the local news to provide them with several stories a year on how saltwater taffy is made.
Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family, it seems like you should maybe be a little more thoughtful with your choices.
Chilling news from Long Island Sound, as a four-passenger prop plane on its way to East Hampton spun into the surf off Montauk Point.
I guess that means I'll never get to see an episode of Superman where Clark Kent and Lois Lane finally get together.
Lois, I love you, and I want there to be no more secrets between us.
Just thought I'd stop by and make sure your equipment is working properly and see if you have any questions.
Well, I'm just gonna change out the card on your unit real quick and I'll be on my way.
Listen, did I catch you at a good time, or are you and the critics busy sucking each other's butts?
I like Dateline, but I really hate waiting two hours to find out who the killer is.
I knew it was the ex-boyfriend. Sleep tight, truck. Sleep tight, firefly. Sleep tight, chair.
He sneaks up and scares the girls while they're starting businesses or getting their fat waxed.
You put a real cougar on Cougar Town, and now that cougar's dead because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws!
Oh. Well, you've got a lot of nerve coming in here after what you did to television.
Tune in tomorrow when we will look at John Kennedy Toole's unheralded early work, The Neon Bible.
I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me?
Maybe you can use that power to help restore TV to the way it was.
Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows, that'll help get things back to the way they were.
Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today because you are the creators of what television used to be before I ruined it.
J.J. Abrams, you take wonder and complexity and present it in a way that no one can possibly understand.
I've got an alien that goes back in time and encounters a koala bear in an Eastern European town.
When Peter told me to make a workplace comedy where people talk to the camera, I thought...
Wonder if I can pull off one of those can you believe what I have to put up with looks to the camera.
Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible, unforgiveable things to each other for embarrassingly small sums of money?
Yeah, and these are the best seats in the house for catching home run balls.
Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah!
Your dad fought in World War II, and you can't even pee in a urinal?
And now it's time for the Channel Five Sports Report brought to you by Kia.
A big day at Fenway today, as the Red Sox bested the Yankees seven to six.
But what really has everyone talking is the fan who lost his toupee at the game.
Comments ranged from sympathy all the way to racial slurs directed at others who chose to comment.
I'm just letting all these hot-rodders know that this is a neighborhood, not a speedway track.
You notice now that he's bald, whenever he thinks about something, he scratches his wrist?
I was planning on looking at pictures of birds later, and I don't want to be all fuzzy-headed for that.
Yeah, now you're always either preparing for a colonoscopy or just coming back from a colonoscopy.
Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me the last couple weeks. Hey, no problem.
Listen, I was at the hospital earlier, and I heard something I wish I hadn't.
Oh, please do not tell me it was a sexist remark, because... because that is not okay.
You know, those nurses are busting their asses, weighing people and seeing how tall they are.
Although I'm not sure what the Spanish word no means, because it doesn't seem to mean the same thing as it does here.
And then we have a chocolate, chocolate cake that's infused with chocolate served with chocolate ice cream and a molten chocolate topping.
Listen, I have something I need to tell you, but... it might be difficult for you to hear.
I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer... and that he has two weeks to live.
Yeah, I feel really horrible for you, and I hate to do this, but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie, and it's, like, 4:40 now, and, so, if I'm going to make it,
I've been trying to call my parents all day, and I can't get ahold of them.
I'll tell ya, this obituary came out great. Carter Pewterschmidt died today of the disease cancer. In lieu of flowers, please send carnival rides to Peter Griffin at 31 Spooner Street.
If we get just one ride out of this, it will have been a success.
Last night, Carter was on his deathbed, and now he looks better than he ever did.
You know, that uncle that sit around in the house all day in his underdrawers, saying he between jobs.
To be between jobs, you had to have had a job in the first place!
Stewie, this is going to sound crazy, but I have a theory about what's going on with Carter.
If Carter Pewterschmidt, the dynamic chairman of Pewterschmidt Industries, were to fall ill or even die, the stock price would plummet.
I don't want you to think I'm not listening, but when's Christmas? Not for a while.
But what I'm saying is, I think Carter is sick or possibly even dead, and that the man we saw today was an imposter brought in to keep
Boy, you are just going to keep on talking with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth, aren't you?
Okay, if this guy is an imposter, he's going to have to do everything Carter normally does.
No, that's just a myth we started so we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs.
Wow. You certainly look a lot better than that walking corpse I saw last week.
Because there's far more money to be made in treating a disease than in curing it.
Why cure someone of cancer in a day if we can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step along the way?
Carter, what you're doing here is criminal, and I'm going to tell the whole world about it.
Jerry, I'm going to let you in on something, and it can't leave this room.
I swear, I felt like I was waiting for Lois to get off the phone.
Lois, your father has a cure for cancer, but he won't release it because it's not profitable.
Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt released a statement announcing the launch of a deodorant for the developmentally disabled called Slow Stick.
He'll just do a magazine cover with a wink to who he is, and all will be forgiven.
Yeah, and these are the best seats in the house for catching home run balls.
Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah!
Your dad fought in World War II, and you can't even pee in a urinal?

I-I have a six-CD changer, so you can pretty much fill the tray and create a world.
HERBERT MORRISON: The frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast! Oh, the humanity!
And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, there's a dog having sex with a woman!
Oh, I know I said, Oh, the humanity! before, but seriously, oh, the humanity even more right now!
Hey, why does your time machine have a sticker that says property of Stewie Griffin?
All right, to be completely honest, and because we've already had sex, it's not mine.
Well, I think someone has a Barnes & Noble gift card coming for their silence.
Brian, I want you to tell me exactly what you did to my time machine.
Well, I didn't want you to find out I'd been using it, so I tried turning the chronological gauge backward.
I don't know what the hell you did with all your messing around, Brian, but somehow my machine seems to have reversed the direction of time.
Well, clearly, when you attempted to reverse the gauge on my time machine, you somehow released a quantum shock wave powerful enough to push the flow of time in the opposite direction.
I can only surmise that you and I were isolated from its effects because we were inside the machine at the moment of temporal inversion.
Well, it's gonna take a while to rebuild the machine, and even longer to recalibrate it for normal time, but I've taken on bigger challenges before.
(squeaking) Your trash barrels were a little close to our driveway. Joe. P.S. Please close the windows when you're giving piano lessons.
I don't really want to be friends with him, but he knows a lot of chicks.
In reverse time, the Republicans make outrageous statements and then the host asks an unrelated question.
Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago, yet we only just recently entered reverse time.
Well, it suggests that time may not simply be flowing backwards; it may, in fact, be accelerating.
Time dilation, in forward time, is a phenomenon caused by a variety of factors in which time moves more slowly.
In reverse time, it stands to reason that the same phenomenon would cause time to accelerate.
Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time is beginning to affect us as well.
Oh, God, it's not gonna be coming out of us; it's gonna be going... (vomit noise)
Now all I've got to do is isolate the cause of the acceleration curve and see if I can duplicate the shock wave.
Oh, my God, it's the greased-up deaf guy running backwards toward that grease truck explosion.
That's all I have to do, right, is duplicate the circumstances, but do it the opposite way.
All right, I was standing right here, the machine was on, I broke the glass... and I turned the gauge backward.
I didn't think you were gonna be able to pull it off, but you did it.
This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby The Shirt Briggs, notorious for always wearing shirts while committing his crimes, has finally been caught after 15 years on the lam.
You always told us you fell off a roof during a fight with the Grinch.
I lied because I was ashamed of the real story: that I let a vicious criminal get away.
Briggs was one of the biggest heroin dealers east of Providence, which is mostly just open water, but still, I'd been undercover, tracking his operation for six months and had finally gained his confidence.
I had almost gathered enough evidence to put Briggsaway for good, but I knew a taped confession would make the case a slam dunk.
Then get ready to spend the rest of your life as a lame gimp with an annoying-voiced wife.
I like that you can tell me a story starting at the Clam and ending on a Ferris wheel.
Yeah, people are starving in Africa, and I'm at a carnival with my best buddies on a beautiful night.
Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.
Yeah, but first, you have to agree there's a huge difference between bisexual men and homosexual men.
Well, Chief, I'm here because I want you to put me on the Briggs case.
I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it because they're so far from the case, they don't care about it at all.
Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down about this Briggs thing, and that kind of bums me out, so I got you this Cookie Puss.
I just don't think I could live with Briggs on the lam for another 15 years.
Joe, if they don't find this guy, it's gonna eat you alive for the rest of your life.
Well, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna need someone who's very good at disguise.
All right, if we're gonna go after Briggs, this might be a good place to start.
Joe, your 25-year-old son and your baby daughter share a room just so you can keep a weirdo Beautiful Mind room?
And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls so they couldn't be traced back to us.
Briggs' FBI profile says the only relationship he's maintained over the years is with a stripper named Tanya.
Boy, it'll be satisfying to finally slap the cuffs on Briggs once and for all.
Hey, you ever just drive through a town and wonder, Who the hell lives here? All the time.
I'm telling you, the Founding Fathers would be very disappointed in where their country ended up.
And so I say unto you, sons of liberty, no longer will free men live under the yoke of giant predatory birds.
And you're a fat nobody, and I'm  Spider-Man, so how do you think I feel?
That's one of the corrupt cops who helped harbor Briggs while he was on the lam for 15 years.
Well, I don't know if it helps, but I found this number next to the phone in his kitchen.
I was saving it 'cause I was going to make a scrapbook of the trip for you guys.
Or we could visit the Pershing House where John Pershing took control of the Eighth Army Brigade in 1914.
Do you have any idea what it's like to have to lift yourself into a wheelchair every morning?
Oh, it's nice of you to remember, Brian, but, frankly, I'd rather let this one slip by.
You keep so busy with your kids, time just seems to slip away, and then you turn around one day and...
You know, Peter, I know Lois is downplaying it, but I think she might actually appreciate it if we threw her a party.
Oh, my God, I hope the guys at Sears portrait studio will be able to retouch this.
You know, she's got like a cute tomboy thing where you feel like you could play softball with her, and then later on, give her the old sau-seege.
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. All right, you guys, that was Lois. She's gonna be here in ten minutes.
We thought it would be better if you heard it from chemicals in an egg.
Oh, and get this: I brought him home today, and coincidentally this is the day
What were once two firm, impressive mountain peaks have become a barren, strip-mined, muddy landslide that droops ever downward.
What were once pink and succulent rose petals now take the form of the shredded, raggedy, blown-out endpiece of a practical joker's exploding cigar.
Lois, you may not be the young filly you were when I met you, but you're still my reliable old plow horse who's there each day to pull the plow, to help around the barn, and let the husband horse-slap a batch at her now and then.
And I have a lovely gift of the batchslapping variety waiting for you when I'm just the right amount of drunk.
Peter, she was already feeling insecure about her age, and then you went and gave her that horrible speech!
Come on, dudes! Who wants to hop in my wheels and head to the beach for some ultimate Frisbee?
No, that's great actually, because now anyone walking behind you will know that you had $60.
Okay, now, I'm an excellent night nurse, so you two get some much-deserved sleep and don't worry about a thing.
And when you wake up, well-rested, your precious little baby will be smiling as bright as the sun.
I can only imagine Madeline would say, Take me out of this disgusting French hospital and find me some real parents.
Look, Peter, you do what you want to do, but I'm going to that party.
So if you don't want to run with the wild horses, then go back to the barn and go to bed.
I don't know what she's trying to prove, Brian, but I can't take it anymore.
The city of Quahog has been stricken with a case of Bieber Fever tonight, as teen idol and fake black guy Justin Bieber is in town for a sold-out show at the Quahog Civic Center.
Tom, I'm standing here at the Quahog Civic Center, awash in a pool of prepubescent sexual moisture.
If I'm the one who made her feel this way, then I'm the one who's got to fix it.
Rupert, the man from the newspaper would like a quote from you about my dancing abilities.
No, Peter. I don't want to act my age, and you don't want that either.
I mean, every guy who's been married a while thinks he wants a hot, young chick, but after you spend an hour with one of them, you want to blow your brains out.
Look, Lois, I'll always treasure the wild, little hottie I met when I was young.
She's taped photographs of Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry on the inside cover, as if she's some sort of hip hybrid of those two things.
Let's, uh, let's just get into this, huh? Dear Diary, got down to 152 today.
Hey, look at this. Kent is so incredibly sexy. He said 'hi' to me today, and I almost died. Also, I learned a funny lesson today in my pursuit of Kent: anal bleaching is better left to professionals. LOL.
Meg, are you asking, in this day and age, when the CEO of Xerox is a woman, when the president of Brazil is a woman, even Rosie O'Donnell is a woman, whether it's appropriate for a girl to ask a boy out on a date?
It's also sad and desperate and I would never do it, but you're not me, are you, sweetie?
I'm sorry, Meg. I think you're great, and I love hanging out with you, but there's something you should know.
I mean, it won't matter once I explain to him what's going on with us.
And it's-it's just in that I don't want to give it to a friend stage, you know?
I've been going to high school with him for three years, and I always assumed he was straight.
Sure. I sleep for, like, six hours every day after school, but other than that, I'm pretty open.
And you only use hello as a greeting, not as a way to outdo some imaginary antagonist in conversation.
Yeah, that's... that's not supposed to be there, so she should probably always wear a hat.
Oh, no, it doesn't have to be awkward, not if we don't make it awkward.
I feel like if I could just know what it's like to be with him, just-just once,
Well, if Kent hooks up with your brother, you could just have Chris describe every last detail to you.
Um, remember that free hug coupon you gave me for my ninth birthday that I never used?
You know, I wish I were secure enough to throw on any old thing and call it an outfit.
Yeah, I know, but I asked someone to do me a favor, and they're not too keen on doing it.
All right, I talked to Chris, and he totally wants to hook up with you, too.
It's just that he's not as comfortable with his sexuality as you are yet, so he's gonna need to pretend to be asleep while it's happening.
I know you've been having a hard time lately, so I wanted to give you something that means a lot to me.
You taught me how to hunt squirrels with poisoned cheese, and then you took me to the hospital when the squirrels tricked me into eating the cheese.
You just need to get back out there, and someday, maybe you'll find the right guy.
At Northwest Airlines, thousands of employees are dedicated to delaying and cancelling flights so you won't get home for the holidays.
I can only imagine what it must have been like for them on that very first Christmas.
Now, gather around, everybody, and hear the awe-inspiring tale that's caused millions and millions of deaths.
Many years ago there was a hardworking young carpenter named Joseph, and one day, Joseph and his friend Robby were hanging...
You know, there's a beautiful spot outside of town where they dump all the foreskins.
Oh, great, and maybe we could slaughter a lamb and light it on fire so that it rains.
I've got to go sit in a circle with the other women and stare off into the fields.
Not just because Mary was a virgin, but because baseball would not be invented for 1,800 years and nobody knew what the hell he was talking about.
It was back when they were like, Drown all the girls, and then they were like, Don't drown all the girls, but she was born on a drowning week, so, you know.
Yeah, I know that girl-- that's Donna Magdalene, and her sister's a bigger slut than she is.
Yeah, let those eggheads in Rome do the brain work, we Jews will do the brawn work.
Oh, I just thought I'd take a break from pooping in the open street to come see you.
I'll come by around that part of the day when the sun goes away and we're all terrified it will never come back.
I hear an oracle from Greece is sending a funny message and I want to be there when it arrives.
I's been sent to bring you the message that tonight you's gonna be getting pregnant with the Son of God.
Yeah, and it's gonna be here soon, so you might want to spruce yourself up.
Oh, and he probably don't want me to tell you this, but be ready 'cause he might give you a little bit of a donkey punch.
Well, if it his will, then his will be done, and I am but his humble servant.
Ah, right. Now everybody listen up while I stuff the rest of this rhetoric down your throats.
Yeah, hey, so tell me one more time how it is that God got you pregnant.
But then when I tell the guys at work, they poke all kinds of holes in it.
And as Mary and Joseph made their way to Bethlehem, three wise men were preparing for a journey of their own.
Hey, you guys, this says a King of Kings will be born in Bethlehem, and we are to go and pay tribute.
People will always want to live next to big Middle Eastern houses with gold and marble.
No, I'm not. Would a guy who feels threatened make sure all his advisors are shorter than him?
We won't leave the light on for you, because what, do I work for the electric company?
Cleveland's got a cousin who had eight girlfriends get pregnant, and he says he's not responsible for a single one.
Looks like all those years fighting off my own father's advances have finally paid off.
And that's why you're allowed to eat as much mozzarella as you want in any church.
And I brought you a breast pump, which in these times is just a guy.
Hey, if you're a virgin, how come I shot out of there like a greased-up cannonball?
Greetings! I have come to see the newborn king, but sadly, I bring no gift.
Also, I'm gonna start dieting and working out so I'm like crazy lean for the, you know, for, for, for the thing.
Oh, my God! I just realized that's the same Jesus as the Jesus from church!
That's a beautiful story, Peter, about people coming together to form something greater than themselves.
Couple of freaking scumbags working some scam, saying how they want to use our phone.
Okay, Mrs. Donovan. Following Mrs. Donovan by Chris Griffin. The first thing that Mrs. Donovan does when she gets home from school is put on sweatpants. Then she eats a whole tube of cookie dough, but she must be allergic to it because there are tears coming out of her eyes and she always throws up right after. Then she puts paper doll clothes on a picture of a sonogram.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I called you in today because your son, Chris, has been getting in quite a bit of trouble lately.
In fact, just yesterday, he tried to pass this drawing off as his Advanced Art project.
Why doesn't Chris come in, and we can treat him like one of the cats?
I mean, when Chris grows up, will he even be able to get a job or take care of himself?
I just wanted to listen to you guys have sex, but you were saying mean things about me.
Oh, by the way, there's a baby in my preschool with HIV, and my teacher gave you something to sign to get him kicked out.
You know, Lois, if Chris is having confidence issues, they have camps for kids like him.
Well, they take kids who struggle in school and help them gain self-confidence in a nurturing environment.
Well, regardless, on the way back, we're stopping at that Down syndrome camp we passed.
Well, we always keep one spacecraft flight-ready in the event a satellite needs service, there's a space station emergency or an Italian guy needs to overexaggerate.
That's a sensory deprivation room that prepares our astronauts for the terrifying emptiness of space.
Oh, and hey, if you get sent off on a space mission, um, don't be the black guy, 'cause you'll die.
Security is launching a full-scale investigation into the genealogy records of every single one of our employees.
By the time you leave Space Camp, you will all be familiar with every device on board this craft.
I went to me barber at the shop, and I come out, I'm looking like this.
If you all saw Apollo 13, you know they had to fix an air scrubber with just the tools in the capsule.
We spent thousands of dollars to send you here and made two trips to Florida in four days.
Listen, just so there are no surprises, don't be scared-- my stuff looks like someone spilled an apple pie in my lap.
Look at this, Lois. a week ago, we call him stupid, and now he's giving tours of the space shuttle.
Well, I don't know what most of these buttons do, but I know this big red one is the one you press to launch.
Oh, God, what if we have to live up here for the rest of our lives?
Yes, I'd like the chopped salad, please, and could I get no onions on that?
If there's one onion on that salad, you can forget the $1.80 tip you need to live.
I know you all must be pretty terrified right now, but we're doing everything in our power to get you safely back to earth.
We just need some time to figure out your coordinates, and calculate the reentry plan.
Our top story, an accidental space shuttle launch that has sent a Rhode Island family into orbit.
You know, this is our one chance to experience the awe-inspiring wonders of space firsthand.
If radio deejays have taught me anything about radio, it's that you got to do two things.
If we don't get this shuttle out of orbit soon, we're gonna run out of oxygen and die.
All right, come on, everyone, we got to put our heads together and try to find a solution.
All right, come on, if mission control thought we could help get the shuttle out of orbit, it can't be that hard.
Oh, Meg, all your suicide threats over the years, and you're just as chicken  as the rest of us.
If we use them now, the ship might slow down enough for gravity to pull us out of orbit.
Well, thanks to no gravity in space, my spine stretched and I am now a confident six, three, so, Lois, I will be leaving you for a hotter woman.
I can't believe we're going to the theater the same day Chris drowned a mouse in a puddle.
You know, I was, uh... kind of one of those theater kids in high school.
It's hard to believe he's the same dog who barked at a pineapple for four hours.
They didn't put masking tape over a seat for Tom Tucker and he's in there pitching a fit.
Mom, am I going to fit in the seat or is this going to be like last time?
Oh, here it is. Here's hoping A Passing Fancy is actually a staying fancy. The highest praise goes to playwright Brian Griffin for his hilarious and insightful look into modern relationships. If you see only one play as an adult,
Mr. Beaker, it is my unfortunate task to inform you that your services will no longer be required by this company.
Well, if you must know, it's because we've noticed large quantities of benzene, ephedrine and everyday Epsom salt have gone missing.
And I've got a pretty good idea who you've been selling it to as well.
Aw, boy, I wish I could hang out, but it has just gotten so crazy.
I mean, they're squeezing every last drop they can out of me, like a bottle of ketchup.
What we do know, though, is that the end result in both cases is joy.
Do whatever you have to do, Brian, but never let him know he's got talent.
Yeah, I mean, I know you through our mutual friend Greg, but sure, I'd say we're friends now.
Yeah, I was planning to submit it to the Roundabout Theater Company in New York.
He just pays me to watch him sleep and rub this knife across my face while I do it.
Well, that's interesting, Brian, because I found this buried in the backyard next to your soup bone.
Just like I knew your play was a mediocre patchwork of hackneyed ideas and tired clichés.
You have no idea how hard it was to sit in that theater with all those braying hyenas.
Couldn't you tell something was up when Chris and the fat man could follow the plot?
May every person that laughs at your sophomoric effort be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity and pierce your heart like a knife.
Hey, I need you to take me to New York for the opening night of my play.
Listen, I just want to say what an inspiration Glengarry Glen Ross was to me when I was writing my own play.
Boy, it's just so weird to be in a room where every single person in the room is a playwright.
We have this thing where we go to the worst regional theater we can find and laugh ourselves sick.
I was fine being an okay writer, until I discovered I was living in a house with a brilliant one.
I know we don't talk about doggy years a lot, but I-I just wish you could have waited to find out how talented you were until I was gone.
Listen, me and the other playwrights are going out to have drinks with Woody Allen and his daughter-wife.
I pulled over some punk Harvard kid who gave me a bunch of lip, so I took his I.D.
Hey, you know, we should drive up there and use that card to eat for free.
And just think, this is where Helen Keller used to eat when she went here.
Hey, sometimes when daddies drive home drunk, they come from far away places, but it's okay because they didn't get arrested and they're still kind of drunk so they-they think it's okay.
By the way, I need you to call my pimp and tell him I quit.
This is just what I've always wanted: to settle down, find a husband and live the married life.
And it looks like I signed one of the witness lines and Peter partially signed the other.
I've learned the difference between true love and doing the entire bowling team of a pizza restaurant on a box spring by a brook.
Sorry, Quagmire, but the only way around the law is if the woman consents to a divorce.
I bet she's what happens if you put a Hooters girl in the microwave on high.
Let her suck it up-- she's the expert. Sorry, keep going. ...and at least try to make things work with Charmese.
This year, in addition to the Hunger Games, we're going to do the Special Hunger Games.
So, Doc, I figured if Charmese and I are gonna live as man and wife,
But I was thinking, maybe this afternoon you'd like to borrow my credit card and buy yourself a new wardrobe.
I haven't gone two weeks without sex since I was in a coma for six weeks.
I was gonna make you breakfast maybe once a week, and give you stuff to do right when you walk through the door after work.
And I would've loved that, Charmese, if I just weren't so super duper double gay.
I told Charmese I was gay, and now she's gonna consent to a no-fault divorce.
If you're really gay and you want that divorce, all you got to do is one thing.
Teacher says every time a bell rings, some gay guy's gonna have sex with another gay guy.
And the Yew Nork Nankees bave heaten the Oltimore Borioles nive to foo here at Yamden Cards.
The Borioles now lace a fong toad rip where they'll face the Sed Rox, the Revil Days and the Jue Blays.
I mean, it's, like, the biggest thing a guy could ever ask his friend to do.
I would never ask you to do this if I had any other choice and if what were at stake was anything less than my entire way of life.
Charmese won't give me a divorce because she doesn't believe I'm gay, so I need you to have sex with me while she watches.
Yes, and I cannot wait to intertwine our bodies and make each other's fingers smell terrible.
I see that now, and the truth is, if you're willing to go this far to get a divorce, then maybe we shouldn't be married after all.
You were real nice to me, Glenn, nicer than any other guy's been, but I wanted to be somebody's wife, not somebody's burden.
Hey, you know, there's not too many guys in the world who would be willing to do something like that for their pal.
Um, yeah, I'm just glad I didn't die from the weird sleep-breathing thing I have.
Yeah, I totally hit it off with this great guy in the Internet, and we're finally going to meet.
Well, how would you like to spend four hours desperately trying to give me a muscular soldier?
I thought why not go back in time to that summer of love in the '60s that everyone's always talking about.
Rupert, I must bring her back to the present and raise her to be my wife.
Oh, hey, um, I just came to say, um... you know, in a couple of years something's going to come along called Sesame Street.
And I know the name makes it sounds Asian, but it's not, and it's going to blow your mind.
You can crawl around on the floor while I drink, smoke, and drive us home.
By the way, did you know you had a tiny conjoined twin attached to your hip?
I'd love to talk to him, but I just don't know what I would say.
Do you know the boy you were coming here to meet tonight is only 13 years old?
This is the universe giving me what I deserve for being such a pig all the time!
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Despite our best efforts, the Texas School Book Depository Awareness Council has failed in its mission to generate public awareness of the Texas School Book Depository.
So at the end of the day, we'll be shutting down operations and laying everyone off.
Look, I've been thinking about your situation with women, and I believe I've come up with a way to get to the source of the problem. Follow me.
Ladies, as you may have guessed, you are here because you have all dated this great guy.
Well, I don't know if I can make eight, but I can certainly do six.
And now I want you to go and take a picture of yourself because it will be your last day alone.
By the way, my attendance at home is gonna be spotty over the next few weeks.
And, well, prize pumpkin from the county fair, that's why I'm naming you my Chief of Police.
Hey-ey, Carol. I almost didn't recognize you without my special sauce all over your face.
Now, I know I'm not much to look at, and ever since I got banned from the arcade,
Also, if I gave you a sandwich, do you think you could get Chris to fart on it?
What? Shut up for ten minutes and pretend we're in the back behind the speakers.
This must be what it's like for you when you're buying potatoes or scraping your heels or smushing on makeup for a sad night out.
This portion of the Channel 5 News at 6:00 is brought to you buy condoms.
I'll pour some wine, rub in some feces, and, to top it off, some mustard mixed with feces.
To think Canada's got her, and we have Kelly Clarkson going to town at a Waffle House.
Just a bunch of cards that say, I farted on your car, with his insurance info.
Geez, it's so weird that Mom and Dad would leave the house without their purse and wallet.
Will you please borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet, and bring it back here?
How about, I won't tell Mom and Dad about the money if you promise to do whatever I say.
I'm only one step above those people who really like dive bars and really need you to know it.
At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card.
Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me.
And I'm sure Buzz Lightyear would have enjoyed it if he had bothered to show up.
Planned Parenthood for 36 hours and here are the pictures of every girl in your class who went in.
Like, I'm part of a group that kind of trashes Anne Frank's house every year.
I'll just go tell Mom and Dad about the money and they'll ground your ass for a year.
Well, I suppose it's about trying new things; sampling the sweet and the savory; not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
But then you oil it up, work your fingers around in there a little, and pretty soon you're pitching and catching.
Yeah, the woman in the song is trying to cope with getting older and she feels trapped because she knows she can't do anything about it.
It's about being trapped in a bad relationship and having the guts to get out of it.
No, no. See, what I hear, is that the woman is starting to hate life.
And then, to make things worse, the snowbird comes around every year, bringing the snow, or death, to remind her that no matter what she does, her fate's already written.
I've never even heard of most of these. Jeffrey at the Park. Mikey's Scoliosis Exam. Nephew Somersault Compilation.
Uh, first of all, I just want to tell you what a huge fan I am.
So, Miss Murray, the reason we came is that we have a question about Snowbird.
Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what Snowbird was about.
As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters.
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
It is. I'm fond of the series, and I wanted the local birds to be aware of that.
Maybe we can get the birds to act out the Benson where a scheduling snafu forces the governor to decide between meeting the president or going to Katie's school play!
Unfortunately for you, that man is very, very Jewish and is suing you for everything you've got.
Oh, thank God. Thought I was gonna have to go back to being on Live with Kelly and Peter.
I haven't had an interview in a while, and I want to make sure it's formatted correctly.
I could be one of those famous voice-over artists you hear on TV or in the movies.
Maybe she could be one of those annoying voices that goes, Ah, ah, ah, not that product.
Which of these leading brands of canned soup has less than a hundred grams of sodium?
Peter, I've had a long day at work, and right now, sex is the last thing I want to think about.
They call me that 'cause I got a big twist at the end of my thing.
Listen, um, I've had such a good time talking to you these past few times that I was thinking maybe we could meet.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting Fairy God Quagmire and Fairy God Joe down at the Fairy God Clam.
Joe, Joe, you realize what you're telling me not to do, I'm already not doing!
Guys, I have to see if she's as special in person as she is on the phone.
Hey, Lois, me make drive time to super fun Clam with noble Quagmire and wheel-monster Joe.
It still works, even though it's got a lot of Civil War brains all over it.
Yeah, I mean, I was just goofing around when I first called you, but when I heard your voice,
Doesn't make any sense, but it... it felt like some force in the universe wanted us together.
You-you-you-you is the phone lady, you the phone, you the phone, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady...
I'm starting to think that whole Chicago City business trip was just a bunch of baloney!
I know. It's like our privates were shaking hands after a successful business meeting in a swamp.
I don't know. I might sit out in the front yard with a rake and wave at cars.
Hey, guys, let's try to re-create this feeling for the rest of our lives, with drugs.
All right, it's 4:59. In just a few seconds, all the unreturned library books will be officially late.
The wieners was already drawed in the books when I got 'em. Libra: A strange man will drop into your life. Hmm. Pisces: Be careful at work today.
Yesterday's was, I've never seen a pigeon die from eating food on the ground, so what's the big whoop?
It's like they say, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and gay guys gotta criticize the host of the party behind his back.
Well, Peter, I'm glad you're all right, but I hope this is the end of your skydiving career.
I saw my whole life flash before my eyes, and we did way too much Star Wars crap.
Excuse me. Now that your family is gone, would you mind if we turn on the TV?
I'm Peter. You know, I never seen a hat like that before, so I'm very scared of it.
Well, if you turn on Channel 14, we can probably catch the end of Muslim Looney Tunes.
Look, I'm just saying if pro is the opposite of con, what is the opposite of progress?
But if you'll excuse me, right now I have to go bring great shame to myself by using the restroom.
Yeah, and he's got his cell phone clipped to his belt like he's some kind of big shot on vacation.
I, for one, think it's great that Peter has enough of an open mind to have a Muslim friend.
Irish guys drink a lot, black guys change their shirts while they tell you a story.
It's a chicken that has been yelled at for two hours and then run over by a Mercedes.
You know, Peter, a lot of people are not as accepting of Muslim culture as you are.
I mean, who doesn't want to sit around a table with a bunch of guys and suck on the same thing?
Sweet hat, obedient wife, and I get to shout Admiral Akbar when I do stuff?
Well, Lois, I happen to be a Muslim now, which means I'll be spending a lot of my time in mostly-empty cafes, watching soccer on an eight-inch black-and-white TV.
Well, if you're going to the market, can you pick up some cereal, some butter, and a loaf of bread?
Hey, can you help me with the 20 paper bags of dates I got in the car?
The monkey in the little vest who was selling them happened to be very persuasive.
I'm just gonna assume this will pass, like your everywhere is a racquetball court phase.
So, Mike, now that you've thoroughly kicked my butt all over the court, what do you say we take one quick second to talk about the Wichita account?
And let me assure you, my racquetball game is no indication of how we do business here at J.T. Stern.
Listen, Peter, some friends of mine and I are getting together tonight and we wanted to invite you to join us.
Look at him, he is the perfect man to help us blow up the Quahog Bridge.
Mahmoud says we all need to act like we're fans of American football so we seem less... b-buh... buhspicious.
We have the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, and even that fat guy at the Atlanta Olympics who didn't do it, but he looked mean, so we said he did.
Well, I gotta go down there right now and tell Mahmoud we can't be friends anymore.
If you can find out what they're planning next, we might actually be able to stop an act of terror.
Remember how upset I seemed to get when Lois said she was leaving town with the kids for a few days?
Remember, we'll be in the van listening to everything, so if anything goes wrong, we'll pull you right out of there.
In order to get past the checkpoint at the toll plaza, we will need an American behind the wheel to arouse the least amount of suspicion.
Look, I know you're mad at our government, but you gotta realize, that's only part of America.
We're the land of the free and the home of the sunburnt, freckled fat guy.
We're the proud nation where someone can shoot up their entire workplace with a thing, and then the next day nobody talks about banning that thing.
It's the land that lets people on Twitter spell the word their any way they want.
And where, if you think you can dance, that assertion will be challenged and evaluated.
Thanks to you, 30 terrorists are behind bars, and every middle-class Arab in this town is now under suspicion.
An aide to Mayor Adam West has been found stabbed to death at the mayor's mansion.
Police say the victim was killed by a knife belonging to the mayor, who is considered the prime suspect at this time.
Also found in the mayor's residence was a blackmail note from the victim threatening to expose the mayor in a corruption scandal unless the victim was paid off.
You can put a picture of a note above my shoulder any time now, Tony.
Tom, I'm standing outside the mayor's mansion, where, against the wishes of his attorneys, the mayor has agreed to an impromptu press conference.
And now I will have my normal post-news review from my mom in her car.
I always knew Mayor West was a little crazy, but I never thought he was capable of something like this.
Brian, all I have to do is start fake sneezing around you and you'll spend the rest of your life outside.
Well, I guess you just never know what kind of rage some people have bottled up.
I would consider it a personal favor to me if you found him not guilty.
I remind you that because we are a small town, many of you may have ties with the defendant or the victim.
And don't try to stand between me and your father; it'll just make it worse.
So I's been asked by the judge to be the foreman, and I want y'all to know that we's gonna run a fair jury and a clean jury, so I brought some wet naps for everyone to wipe off their areas.
Joyce will anchor the news, and I don't think anyone wants that to happen again.
Look, I know everyone's in a hurry, but shouldn't we at least go over the evidence once before we vote, just to be fair?
Here's the facts: there was a note from the victim, threatening to expose the mayor in a corruption scandal.
And finally, that lady with the Peter Gallagher eyebrows on the witness stand saw the whole thing.
I mean, there are people who would benefit if he were put away for murder.
It's important to make sure everyone is happy, so I took a lot of polls.
He spits whenever he makes the ch noise, which, in this language, happens a lot.
I'm expected to entertain him and his wife tonight, so if anyone knows a good restaurant in the area...
Sushi or tapas, something where they're always bringing stuff to the table so you have something to talk about.
Yeah, are you trying to suggest that Mayor West's enemy faked a corruption letter and then killed himself?
You know, something bothered me about the stationery that note was on, with the-the decorative M border.
How do you know? Because I once got a note from the Marriott written on the same paper. Dear Brian. You were amazing last night.
I did a dog once, but I was in the Philippines, and I sure as hell didn't write him a letter.
The victim had access to all the Office of the Mayor stationery he could ever want, yet he hand-made a letterhead on stationery from a Marriott?
Look, you guys just say the word and I'll put this ball with cheese in it on the floor.
Okay, look, tempers are starting to get a little heated, so why don't we all go take us a little potty break?
Now you're all gonna have to witness me taking an old-man pill that looks way too big to swallow.
Even if you don't believe the note was legitimate, there was an eyewitness who saw the entire thing.
But still, I don't see how she could look out a window and witness a crime.
Trust me, you're banging eight strangers who responded to a flyer, at some point you're gonna look out a window and question every decision you've ever made.
And we're probably partway into it here, so one of your eyes is stuck shut.
Thanks, it's okay to look the other way when y'all pass me on the street with y'all's wives.
And that places the witness right here, next to the lubricating station and the terrible smelling guest book.
Yeah, let's wrap this up-- I got the director's cut of Raiders of the Lost Ark waiting for me at home.
Okay, the majority of this room now believes that there is reasonable doubt about Mayor West's guilt.
Now I'd really like to hear from the holdouts because a man's life hangs in the bal...
And all I wanted was to fire a missile into a fault line to sink half of Quahog into the ocean and make my real estate waterfront.
Yeah, I mean, it was a pretty intense experience, but the important thing is, in the end, justice was served.
Hi, I don't know who to complain to about this, but I'm still getting XVIII's mail.
Ugh, damn it, I always wake up before I find out if they can understand the baby.
I always wanted to go to Canada, but then South Park went, so we couldn't go.
In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that a Canadian strip club is the most magical place in the world.
But I don't want to get any crap from your wives about me taking you to a strip joint.
We now return to Stabbed in the Butt, the only game show where if you get the answer wrong, you get stabbed in the butt.
Hey, do I give you the third degree every time you go for one of those luxurious mammograms?
They even got a special map that lets you choose who you wan to dump your poop on.
Hang on, you guys; I don't know if I can pull out of this-- giggity!
Still, you know, we saved so much trouble not flying commercial, I think we came out ahead.
Okay, I know you're a pilot and everything, but not everyone likes to talk about planes as much as you, Quagmire.
You guys, I think, for the time being, we're gonna have to start thinking in terms of survival.
So I could have this cool hat and 'cause it felt like heaven when I was doing it.
Hey, do you think there's directions about starting fires in the song We Didn't Start the Fire?
Okay, we still got nothing to eat, so it looks like we're gonna have to hunt animals for food.
Listen, I wish you had a family to take care of you, too, but that's a choice you made.
You guys, we've been out here a couple days now, and I don't think anyone's coming to get us.
Peter, if you don't, the only other option is we sit here and wait to die.
Well, I hate to ask you this, Quagmire, but do you know how to change a diaper?
Listen, why don't we head back to my place, grab a bite to eat and watch the big curling match on TV?
How could Dad turn into some kind of feral creature just from two months in the wilderness?
Well, he was living among wild animals for two months, and you know how impressionable your dad can be.
I guess we're all just gonna have to work together to reintroduce your father to civilized society.
You know, long ago, before this happened, your father did make some videos in case he ever became feral.
If you're listening to this, you've probably become feral, and you're probably thinking of a nice juicy rabbit right now.
Okay, good. So, feral Peter, why don't you put in tape number two and let's get started.
All right, now, I've been trying to figure out something we can do together, and I think I've found it.
We've tried everything to bring the old Peter back, but we can't break through to him.
Hard as it is to admit, it might be time to let Peter be where he belongs.
Peter, we all love you very much, but we think maybe this is where you belong and where you'll be happy.
Whatever adventures lie ahead of you, know that my heart will always be with you.
I love you, Dad, and no matter where you are, you'll always be my father.
And luckily, I don't know many words, so I was able to relearn them all in a day.
But I want you to keep talking to me in that sexy voice while we do it.
You're gonna have to pay a high to if you want to get into this tunnel.
For those of you who turned out to see my stand-up comedy debut at Zany's last night,
But today's breaking news is that the New England Toy and Game Company has issued an immediate recall of all of its stuffed bears, like the one shown here.
Our top story, Channel Five News anchor, Tom Tucker, has a meltdown at a local comedy club.
Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun and the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead-end road.
Ms. Simon, enough years have gone by since you wrote your classic hit, You're So Vain.
Don't you think it's time to tell the world who that song was written about?
This is the first day we're allowed to the end of the driveway, and I intend to take full advantage.
You ever notice how in every photo of P. Diddy, his mouth is hanging open?
My white blood cells attacked the pathogens and created antibodies, and then the pathogens were filtered out by my kidneys into my urine and then expelled from my body, you slut.
I mean, I'm glad you're feeling better, but, boy, that sick voice of yours was hot.
There's Kendra's birthday and the baby shower, and with this move, I-I just cannot get sick right now.
You owe me from when I took you to see Shakespeare in the Park, even though it was the part of the park where the gay guys go to have sex.
I need you to drive me to that toy factory so I can get Rupert back.
Tell you what, you drive me to Middleborough, and I'll teach you my secret to picking up chicks.
So when you guys aren't celebrating a big bowling victory, what do you normally do here?
Also, I get the sense that Kristen Stewart is more of a bath person when she really needs a shower.
Well, here we are. great. Hey, may on the ride home, someone else can tell a story.
This tour will take us deep into the factory, and when the time is right, we'll slip away and find Rupert.
Every once in a while, one of our toys becomes real, and we have to make sure it doesn't get out.
I had to deliver a speech to Britain, and I overcame my stutter through some pretty kooky means.
Hey, Horace, get that wiener out of your hand and give us three more beers over here!
We shot some drug dealer this morning, and he had three Red Sox tickets in his pocket.
You know, if we leave right now, we can probably still get there before the first pitch.
Doctor said I'd be making bland jokes for about a week, then I'd be good as new.
Hey, Horace, why don't you take that wiener out of your hand and get me a beer.
Well, maybe next time you can come with us when we go to Red Sock Field.
Lois, it's one thing to steal my friends, but don't go giving them stupid new nicknames.
Look, Lois, I have my friends, and you have groceries and all those rusty pink razors in the shower.
I mean, it's nice to make new friends, but not if it means losing the best friend I've ever had.
I guess I shouldn't be telling you who you can and can't be friends with.
It's great. You get to see big, husky chicks elbow each other right in the jugs.
Yeah, and I'm bringing my grill so we can eat corn in the parking lot before we go in.
Plus, I'm planning on having my period really hard later, and I want to be in the tub when it happens.
Now remember, we're here to impress the girlfriends of guys we barely know, so when you get the ball, throw it like a cannon.
Yes, you must leave them behind, and they must be in a crumbly mess so that the city clean-up workers have to chase the little bits when the wind blows.
Oh, yeah? Well, speaking of things that are brown and can run, meet our new teammate!
That's right. We got to know each other while I was following him around my store.
Like when you're the only one at the table where the waiter doesn't say, Good order.
It is a spectacular cut, superbly seasoned and the marbling is some of the best I've ever seen.
I'd just like to say that... before today, I didn't know the Munsters were driving around in a funeral car.
And so let us take a look back on his life through this video commemorating all the DUI's that he was responsible for.
No. No, no, I'm just... not used to seeing corpses that big and not in a toilet.
Thanks. You know, I could use some part-time help here preparing the bodies, if you're interested.
I could use the money, and I'm getting kind of tired of my old job.
Only a half a point divides our top two competitors as we enter the last event, the Meg Roll.
I mean, as long as we got a place to drink and a restroom for businessmen to have homosexual encounters.
I just don't think a good way to start a screenplay is, 400 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland.
Yeah, and don't you think it's confusing that every character in the movie is named Movie Guy? Come on, you guys.
What are we doing at the Clam? Look, guys, we tried other bars, we tried drinking at home, we even tried the big end-of-the-year high school party that will change everything.
Sorry, Amanda. By the law of '80s movies, a newly transformed tomboy supersedes your long-standing hotness.
Let's face it-- there's only one drinking spot for us, and it's the Clam. But, Peter, it's closed.
Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you, do you take that as an answer?
Maybe we should just let the Clam go and, I don't know, spend more time with our families.
Hey, uh, remember... remember-remember when... remember when... remember when Quicktime here passed out in this... in this booth... this booth, and we did stuff to him that you do to ladies and we-we promised we'd never tell you.
And don't lie, or I'll tell Jennifer Connelly that you're the one who's been mailing her those dog heads.
Chris, Mr. Dougan's wake is tomorrow, and there's going to be a body in that casket.
Three local men have barricaded themselves inside a Quahog bar, and are currently in a standoff with authorities.
It's where the three of us made that suicide pact that Quagmire and I are gonna back out of at the last minute.
Peter, you get out here right now, or else I'm throwing away all of your Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.
Plus, as a former athlete, it's my responsibility to invest my earnings in a restaurant, bar, or car dealership.
Meg, the family is here for Mr. Dougan's wake, so could you please bring in the body?
My husband had filled out an organ donor card before he passed away, and a woman just lost her face in a freak accident.
I don't know. It's just a German guy listing items and then declaring them good.
Well, I hate to admit it, Lois, but over the last couple of years, this town has changed a lot, a not necessarily for the better.
Yeah, I mean, the other day, I left a doodie right in the middle of a Crate and Barrel.
You know, it's hard for me to take the things you say seriously when I know what's been in that mouth of yours.
Look, I realize Quahog isn't the small town it used to be, but it's still very special to me.
Lois, I know you love this town, but nothing is ever as innocent as it seems.
Okay, the one thing you don't want to do is tell me to take it easy.
We finally went to a restaurant without somebody yelling at us, and then the rest of the place applauding them.
Pretty soon, guys are just gonna be showing their boners to babies and stuff, I bet.
I mean, all I ever wanted was to raise our children in a wholesome place, far away from all the crime and problems of the big city.
Um, I'm looking for a wholesome place for my family to live, so I'd like to buy your farm.
They usually take care of it, and then I just go ahead and do stuff.
Well, that's gonna be very hard to do now that we're living on a farm.
Peter, you went out and bought a farm without even talking to me about it?
Well, Lois, in my defense, I have nothing to back up the beginning of this sentence.
And it's not like it's the first time you made a big family decision without consulting me.
Lois, you were saying yourself how you want our kids to grow up in a wholesome place away from the big city.
And, Chris, you been telling me how you wanted to watch animals humping other animals what might not be okay with it.
Yay! Now I can be one of those filthy teens with sad eyes at a farmer's market!
A farm with big open fields, Brian, where you can just run and run and be free and no one will ever hurt you.
Well, Lois, a big part of owning a farm is crossing a road very slowly with cows.
Look, I know it seems like dirty work, but, Chris, you got to spread that seed until your sack is empty.
And, Meg, you got to clear away all that brush so he can plant it deep where it needs to be.
Okay, we'll keep at it, but I think that hoe is pretty much worn out.
Part of being a farmer is having a best friend named Larry who I spend huge amounts of time with, but never actually talk to.
And meanwhile, you're spending half our money down at the General Store, and the other half at the Specific Store.
And is it true that you've been spending the farm's money on gingham shirts you tie into a knot to expose your belly?
Well, with all this debt and no income, there's no way we're gonna be able to keep up our bank payments.
Farming takes incredible skill and knowledge and the sort of specialized experience that takes generations to acquire.
My point is that maybe I should go to the local state college and take some agriculture courses.
With the proper training, maybe I can actually learn something that will save this farm.
And so, as I look out at your smiling faces filled with hope, all I can think is, you are completely screwed.
The proudest day of a man's life is when his dog goes off to college.
Now, I know you're freaked out, but when you really stop and think about it, this meth lab is our family's best chance to make meth in a lab.
Well, right now, our family needs us to sell illegal drugs to the tank top community.
I'm going to respond violently to outside noises that the rest of you don't hear.
I'm back from agricultural school, and I might have the solution to our farming trouble.
I turn my back for a month, and this place turns into a drug den!
Our top story: Methamphetamine is flooding into Quahog in epidemic amounts, and is believed to be originating from the nearby rural community of Farmton.
Well, if we're dealing so many drugs to Quahog, why is the Quahog envelope so light this week?
First of all, you sat in something green and it's on your butt, so no one's gonna follow you.
And second, no one's gonna leave a place where there are tons of beakers for a place where there are zero beakers.
And the lab inside the house, which is currently producing an incredibly volatile and explosive batch of thermo-reactive chemic...
Well, luckily the value of this place plummeted because this is a meth town now.
You know, I think the lesson here is that if your community has problems, you don't abandon it.
That's right, Lois, 'cause wherever you run to, your problems have a funny way of finding you.
Laura gets home at 7:00, so I figure we can stare at our wine glasses till then.
Well, listen up, everybody, 'cause it's time for our grand prize drawing for those tickets to see Celine Dion live in Las Vegas!
I saw what I look like in a car window, and now I don't want to go.
We now return to Franklin and Bash with Indicators to Show Which One is Franklin and Which One is Bash.
Hey, Stewie, I don't know if you have any interest in this, but I was wondering if you want to go to Vegas with me and see Celine Dion.
Last night, I was thinking to myself, Why fly, when we can get there instantly?
Well, you see, I recently completed construction on a teleportation device, and it occurred to me, this may be the perfect chance to try it out.
Okay, now, the device is powered by kinetic energy, so you've got to dance to make it work.
Well, since the teleportation machine failed to get us to Vegas, I suppose we should just catch our plane.
Take your Juicy sweatpants and your dirty pillow from home, and your bucket of Coke, and get the hell out of my sight.
Plus, the air is clean because they suck up all the cigarette smoke and dump it in the bad hotels.
You know, I know we're switching to a digital world, but I-I think this little guy's still got a place in it.
You know, they always set those things to pay out more so they can lure people into the casino.
Hmm, I do have a Griffin here, but that room was checked into hours ago. What?
They were promised a single millionaire, but it's really just a bunch of horny squirrels in a rich-guy suit.
Well, this sucks. Hey, I'm gonna go try one of those slot machines by the entrance.
They always set those things to pay out more so they can lure people into the casino.
I mean, doesn't it seem weird to you that we have to re-check-in every 20 minutes?
Do you know what it's like to go to the doctor and see your own foot in the garbage can?
Well, I was on my way to get ice cream and I passed a roulette table, and I put it all on 16 because of that Taylor Swift song, Sixteen.
I know. I actually thought I was gonna win big and get that plastic surgery I always wanted.
And-and you are gonna laugh about this, if I know your dark sense of humor, but I may have gambled away our plane tickets.
Honestly, I'm trying to sell my condo, and I need people to come to the open house and talk about how nice it is.
Wow, the price per square foot is quite competitive with similar homes in the area.
Do know how much it hurt my feelings when you paused before introducing me to your parents?
It's like I say, the best thing you can see in Vegas is bar, bar, bar.
I suppose. I just wish we didn't have to borrow money from a loan shark.
I want to pay a Wayne Neon look-alike to beat up a Rita Rudner look-alike.
Stewie, we got to get the hell out of here before that loan shark finds us.
Well, I wasn't gonna tell you till later, but I actually used part of my portion to take care of some personal business.
Don't worry; I'll get that money back no matter what, and for sure I'm not gonna stop first and get some crepes in the lobby.
You bastards think you can just borrow a bunch of money from a loan shark and then waste it on tacky suits?
Sir, we can't give you any money, but if you've got some milk and a bowl, we can give you a pretty healthy way to start your day.
We have no money, no way to get home, and one of the loan shark's goons is probably gonna bust through that door any minute and kill us both.
Even if we could get back there, we'd just be putting the whole family in danger.
Well, not clean for the staff of the hotel, but that's not really gonna be our problem anymore.
I mean, I'm just gonna end up like Chris, only I'll be smart enough to realize how miserable I am.
And you've only got a few good years left anyway, and that's if we even get out of here alive.
You know, the only thing that was holding me back even a little is knowing how much Lois is gonna milk this.
Everyone, I truly want to thank you for your support and remind you that, as far as casseroles go, we're good on pasta, but we could use some more dessert items.
Oh, I miss my baby so much, and I'm more of a chocolate person than a fruit person.
The machine must have created two pairs of us-- one that was teleported to Las Vegas and the other that wasn't.
Oh, well, th-these thugs came to shoot you, and I tried to throw myself in front of the bullet, but it must have gone, like, under my armpit or something
I tried like hell to talk you out of it, but you jumped off a balcony.
People keep coming back every hour because they think it's a regular show, like-like the volcano or the pirate ship thing.
There are tornados in the Midwest, and I like watching poor people scramble to save what little they have.
Yeah, look, I'm guessing there's some kind of soccer match from your home country going on, and I get that, I do.
But, uh, some of us are trying to sleep, and I could almost deal with the noise, but it's the cologne, all right?
Okay, so I know you're a harmonica, but right now you're a 40-year-old woman with a good body in a hotel pool.
Unfortunately, removing it would require a very expensive surgery that's not covered by your T.G.I. Friday's gift card.
What was that? I don't know, but suddenly it smells like John Popper in here.
I pushed a boy behind your car so I could do all this harmonica stuff.
I am gonna make this family proud, and not just you guys, but that old painting of my ancestor in the attic.
I wonder if I can get my old job back painting kids' faces at birthday parties.
Eh, I did all right for a guy who just had his first homosexual experience with his guitar teacher.
I got tired of not being able to find my bags, so I tied a vaguely Hanna-Barbera-looking character to it.
And that means me and the other jocks get to throw you in the pool.
Now, look, Peter, j-just because you're a member now and I'm your guest, that doesn't mean things are gonna change between us, right?
And then I paid a couple of Mexicans to run over him with their car.
And now that I've made you aware of the misunderstanding, you're still continuing with it.
I got a big-ass coat, chair to sit in, chalice cup of wine and a midget, but I ain't going out there with all them monsters out there!
Well, now that you know how it feels, maybe you want to give him an apology.
Look, Peter, I'm sorry for the way I treated you, but is there anything you can do to get me back in the club?
I know it seems unfair, but, hey, there ain't no rules in a tickle fight.
I mean, it's just human nature to suck up to the people above you, crap on those beneath you and undercut your equals.
Well, then we just got to figure out a way to make you fancier than Barrington, so he's got to suck up to you.
Your Majesty, won't you please join me as my personal guests in the Barrington Room?
Yeah, I hear it's even harder to get in there than the University of Arizona.
Really? Yeah, well, he used to be a member here, but he was very annoying.
You know, he got a piece of Jackie Kennedy before she was defiled by that hairy olive-eater.
Well, I wasn't sure about Pewterschmidt, but after hearing you gentlemen talk, maybe I could give him another chance.
Hey, let's get a couple of girls and have seventh-grade-in- the-same-room-make-outs. Carter? Wait a minute.
I thought you were just some suck-up loser, but you have shown me that you've got the mettle to be one of us.
Yes. Now, I believe there is just one last piece of unfinished business to take care of here.
I'm sorry, but the Viscount James Earl Tennis Racquet and Duke of Lacrosse Team already arrived two hours ago.
It's just a fact that, at a certain age, men start to rot from the inside out.
Hey, Lois, what do you say we do what Anderson Cooper tried once before he decided he hated it?
On average, Americans spend upwards of 50,000 hours waiting for shrimp over the course of their lives.
When I heard that, I thought to myself, Why on earth don't these guys just hurry up?
And since you were so well behaved at the dentist, you can order anything you want.
Ah, yes. You see, legend has it that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket hid his fortune in fear of it being taken by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
Okay, I'm gonna go do diarrhea, and then I'll be right back to take your order.
I'm talking about the fact that our son, who you insisted we name after that guy Marty, looks exactly like him!
You think I'm an idiot? That I wouldn't notice that our son is a dead ringer for the guy who fixed us up?
Well, this child's place mat is telling me to dig for buried treasure by the side of the highway.
The Earth neither hates nor loves, but sits, waiting patiently, for people to do famous stuff.
Well, it's not the treasure, but it looks like it's a clue to where the treasure is. Face the circle in the square, you'll see me, I'll show you where.
Okay, well, if there is a treasure out there, we don't want anybody else to know about it.
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker, here with local fortune seeker Peter Griffin, who appears to have found a clue to a hidden treasure.
That's right, Tom, and I sincerely hope that the caption beneath me doesn't say Local Fatty. Let's do something about that caption.
Nurse, write down that clue, and then go out in the waiting room and... maybe start lowering expectations.
I don't know nothin'. Everyone doubted me, so I wanted to rub it in their faces that I was right.
Look, you guys doubted me, mocked me, constantly handled my Eggo despite my clear instructions, and now you want a piece of my treasure?
Look-- there's a plaque! This square shall forever honor the memory of my son, Timmy Musket. Always a chip off the old Block. May he rest in peace.
Wait-- when I played Jane Musket in the school play the last three weekends-- thanks for coming...
I mean, last time we came into some money, he just wasted it on all those diamond pinkie rings for everybody.
What do you mean? Come on! You think the fat man's gonna figure out those clues?
Yes, I mean, he's the guy who put all those little bald men in incubators because he thought they were babies.
So, you walk into a store, you see the hundreds of options for candy, and you choose a Mounds bar?
Uh, I've probably been having a Mounds bar two or three times a day for the last 25 years.
Two friends sailing in the sky in a wicker basket with a strange man holding a cheese plate?
Then you get in there, and you order like you never heard of food before!
Well, I hate to say it, but I guess we're supposed to dig this kid up.
Feels so weird to be looking at a dead kid and not have angry parents nearby.
Hey, look! There's something written inside the lid. You've crossed the miles, you've pawed through clues.
You know, Peter, in the first eight minutes of Meg's play, before I walked out, they said Miles Musket was a horrible drunk and a wife beater.
Or maybe he misspelled it because cursive is hard, and everyone should get off his back.
And cheers and boos might be referring to a bar where he would cheers, and drink his booze. Hits missus, cheers and booze.
All right, let's you put some makeup on and get right down to The Clam!
Here, hold this. Congratulations. You have won The Founding Father Restaurant Treasure Hunt Challenge. Please enjoy one free meal at select Founding Father locations.
I mean, so what we won't be able to pay to fix them veins in your legs.
Yeah, I was driving past there, and we were out of some stuff, so I...
All right, even though we just walked in, and this whole place is one hallway, let's consult the map.
Okay, Lois, I'll be right here, standing uncomfortably close to the unnecessary piano player in the middle of the mall.
There aren't enough verses in any song I could write that would express how much hatred I have in my heart.
Oh, come on. When I was a boy, we always used to go clothes shopping at Sears.
Well, it's an incomplete twin that never developed into a fully-formed person but still exists as a growth feeding off your body.
I'm just gonna give you a little topical anesthetic, and we'll have a closer look.
I like to poke him 'cause it makes him happy, and I feel it a little bit in my nads.
You know, Lois, a lot of times you go into someone's house, and it's just a house, but you can tell this is a home by all the love here.
Go stall 'em for 20 minutes and pray that it's not too damp in here.
Oh, when you're trapped under a layer of fat, a muffled folk song is like manna from Heaven.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking we would just watch Dr. Oz and eat cold cuts off our stomach.
Did you know that the Quahog Museum has an interactive display on the history of the garment district?
You know, just because everything's new to you doesn't mean you have to do it all at once.
And what is this pamphlet I found under your bed called The Boston He Party?
Wow! Is there any better time in the world than 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday?
You already have two days of hard work under your belt, and there's so much more work to come.
I'm using my knowledge of the local food scene to get this woman to go to bed with me.
And this is just the first game of the first round of a three-week tournament?
Keep reading to them every night, and I think we're gonna have a great year.
Listen, Doc, is there any way you can have this thing on my neck removed?
No, the ski boots that was in the back flew up and chopped her head off.
So, uh, you know, Chip, now that you're a free man, this is a chance for you to go out and make a real life for yourself someplace.
And where are the drapes? Chip took them to make play clothes for the children.
What's so great about him? Well, to be honest, the same thing that used to be so great about you.
Just that when you were younger, you were as passionate and full of life as him.
Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'll come up with something.
After all, I'm the guy who invented Choose Your Own Adventure or Have Pie in Bed.
Hey, welcome back to the Mikey Tony Magnanimous Hour, where real people get magnanimous about real things.
This week's real thing-- hey, Native Americans, if I saw you on the street begging,
My family liked me, and-and I didn't feel bad about not ever doing new stuff.
Meg throws away people who come out of her body all the time, nobody says nothing.
If you had only done that while you were here, we wouldn't be in this mess.
The bad news is, we did an X-ray, and your body is full of a spooky skeleton man.
I got so used to watching TV and looking for tiny jean fibers in my nuts,
Well, that sure is nice of you, Peter, but... there's a big old world out there.
I wanna take in and out of my pocket every 30 seconds for the next six years.
You're gonna be like the first guy in the neighborhood to own a Model T.
That's the one Grandma and Grandpa brought Stewie when he was still in the hospital.
Oh, and here's the card they sent me. Three kids on $40,000? Have fun with your crap life.
I-I'm just nervous that somebody else is gonna get pictures of their cat on the Internet first, and then I'll always be known as the second guy to get pictures of his cat on the Internet.
Quagmire, I don't know how to tell you this, but there's already cats on the Internet.
Yes, well, you know I turn to poetry when matters of the heart weigh heavily on me. If you're happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
It's like you took all the colors that exist and said, , here's a new one.
Excuse me. I bought this laptop here yesterday, but when I got home I noticed the apple already had a bite taken out of it!
So, yeah, I was the first woman to ride her bike cross-country with no seat.
Whenever I talk about stuff like this, most people look at me like I'm some kind of disgusting perv.
I don't really remember, but I do feel like I might be down a couple of quarts.
All right, I came up here for a photo shoot and it just got way, way out of hand!
Well, I've always had this fantasy of having sex on the basketball court in front of my high school principal.
Okay, Glenn, now that we've covered ourselves in black ink, let's do it until we've created every character in the Chinese alphabet.
Glenn, remember, the thing we love most about each other is that we push each other way beyond our normal boundaries.
I just hope we can handle it better than blue and yellow did when they split up.
Okay, you know what, let's not... let's not do this in front of the kids.
Yeah, it seems like lately that girlfriend of yours is taking things a little too far.
I know you just got back from Vietnam and you love me, but I'm gonna go run a train with this group of Black Panthers I just met.
I know you came all this way to New York to visit me, but I'm gonna go do blow and have sex with a bunch of stockbrokers.
Well, I got tired of waiting for you to get home, so I thought I'd come to you.
I mean, I understand that no doesn't mean no, but certainly some word has got to mean no.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car and walk a straight line, please.
Well, if you're so smart, why don't you come up here and pick them yourself?
So, why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away.
Right, and if we can't find him in here, he sometimes likes to hang out in between the blades of grass in my lawn.
Oh, I thought he might have been talking about this super kinky woman who's always down here, trying to lure men to her sex slave shed.
The time we met The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, that winter we lived on the sun, and here's my favorite.
I can't believe the guy with the ponytail and the facial tattoo at the front desk would let this happen.
Oh, I swear to God, you get one inch closer to me, and I'm gonna shoot you.
You know, I guess what I realized from all this is that when it comes to relationships,
I been reading this novel about three guys, happen to be pigs, uh, that decide to build their own houses.
Besides, you're always naked, except for when Lois dresses you up in that rain gear.
I also went to the video store and got Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties.
We now return to the Kentucky Derby, where 90% of the audience roots for the horse with the cutest name.
Well, I heard about how Peter's making you see him naked lately, so I thought the only way to get even is for you to see me naked.
Remember that all wagers on Friday's Meg Griffin slaughter must be on my desk by Thursday.
Also, Zack Morris, if you could stop freezing time to talk to the camera, the day would go a lot faster.
Yeah, Meg. You can do it. You're a smart woman, and women can do anything nowadays.
Meg, we've been over this. Just because a Facebook page has over 2,000 likes doesn't mean you have to kill yourself.
Don't you remember how much money your father wasted so he could make grand staircase entrances?
That sex tape I released should be everywhere by now, and then they'll have to kick me out of the school.
Listen, Meg, we decided that maybe it's best if you don't talk to us anymore.
I don't want to get beaten up by a guy unless it's in a limo after prom.
It's one thing if you put your penis inside-out in the safety of your own bedroom, but to have it done in the cafeteria...
To this day, I can't have sex with a woman against her will without thinking about rape.
The only way you're going to end this is if you find a way to even the score.
Are you here to dick around, or you want to do Inside the Actor's Studio?
All right, Meg, the best way for you to focus your rage is if I wear the mask of the person who's bullied you every day of your life.
Well, then what we're about to do may seem strange, but just go with it.
Um, listen, before we start, could you not hit me here because these are pretty sensitive?
A year later, my body reacted to a frozen hot dog, and I died of septic shock.
Well, I can't look at this for three months, so I've come up with a solution.
Our top story: price wars are heating up between all of the major airlines and even a couple of the little crashy ones.
Tom, I'm standing here at Boston's Logan Airport, where some of the same security people who let the terrorists on the plane are still gainfully employed.
With such low fares, even those who never fly are lining up to buy tickets.
Early reports suggest that this could be the most profitable day for airlines in the last two decades.
Now, one thing that makes us more cultured than our European counterparts is high school football.
Well, if I must accept your proposal in order to break the entail and save my family's estate, then yes, I will marry you.
Today was the last day of the low airfares, and I couldn't let the opportunity pass, so...
Uh, uh... tickets for the, um, the grand opening of the biggest water park in all of Rhode Island.
Hmm, well, pardon my skepticism, Lois, but I didn't read about this in the latest issue of Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.
For fear that, um... th-that this new park would put all other water parks out of business.
Okay, everyone, put the sunblock on now, so when we get off the plane, we go right to the park.
If you look out the left side of the airplane, you'll see the very popular Seven Flags Atlantis.
I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the seatbelt sign, so you idiots can all stretch and let the fart festival begin.
Look, kids, this is the Forum, where the ancient Romans used to have their famous political debates.
And this is the Penthouse Forum, where dirtbags write letters about boning in the back of grocery stores.
Well, who wants to see where the ancients established the foundation of our American democracy?
And who wants to hear a story about a girl who moved to New York without any underpants?
Peter, the kids are going to the Italian circus, so I thought it might be romantic if we watched the sunset from St. Peter's Basilica.
You go ahead, I'm gonna stay here and get frustrated with this nonresponsive hotel TV remote.
I can't believe it's too much for you to watch a sunset with your wife in one of the most romantic cities in the world!
Well, what do you expect, Lois? I didn't want to come here he first place. I'd rather be back home.
She'll go out, kill her roommate during a sex game, and then she'll be fine.
I show you all-a the things I do all day that make-a me smell like this.
I thought you were dead. Well, paisan, as long as love is alive in Italy, so am I.
Now, look, buddy, there's a million ways to lose a gal, but there's only one sure way to get her back.
When Lois pulled away on that motorcycle, you laid down on the ground and went to sleep.
Look, Peter, showing up here in that stupid costume isn't going to win me over.
We haven't done it like that since we were engaged but allowed to sleep with other people.
I got-a the most beautiful woman in the world at home, and I no wanna keep her waiting.
Peter, I know you love it here, but riding your bike around town isn't paying the bills, and the kids aren't learning anything at that Italian school.
I mean, you have to give most of what you earn to the mafia that terrorizes this village.
So, you see, Mr. Consulate, all we want to do is get back to our home in America.
Your family must take a citizenship test and go through the immigration process like any other foreigner.
All right, Meg, part of being an American citizen is having an opinion on certain hot-button political issues.
Now, where you listed employment, some of you wrote Family Guy, and others wrote The Family Guy.
All right, now that you've completed your initial application, it will need to be filed by an immigration lawyer at a cost of approximately $5,000 per person.
And assuming that all goes through, you should have your citizenship back in 16 months.
Mr. Miyagi, this is kind of embarrassing, but I'm having a problem with erectile dysfunction.
Well, thanks for showing me and the kids what the rest of the world is like, Lois.
You know, it actually looks like the Native Americans have done all right for themselves.
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I've done this several times today, and your husband just isn't responding.
And here it is, the number one song for the 10,000th week in a row, Huya-Huya-Huya!
But I'm afraid our only hope is that perhaps the alternate Stewie in this universe has created his own time machine that we can use.
Hey, shot in the dark, but, uh, is anyone else in the mood to run really fast in one direction?
I time-traveled ahead to Christmas so I wouldn't have to wait all year for the new toys to come out.
And would you like to come home and clean my toilet, while we're both doing stuff for each other?
God, look at all the perfectly good stuff that people just throw out for no reason.
If you have a twin mattress, aren't you pretty much a failure as a human being?
Well, I suppose I could use a new hobby now that the time machine is gone.
So, when you go to those booths and cast your ballot, remember, Warren G. Harding is way the cutest!
Okay, Brian, I'm just putting this out there, but I'm a baby, and only dicks don't let babies win.
You know, usually, I'd be sitting inside writing, you'd be working on one of your machines.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but Brian's injuries are just too severe for us to save him.
I don't know how much longer he has, but I suggest that you all go in and say your good-byes.
I was gonna be a little better than you, but we were both gonna be good!
I've just got to rebuild the time machine, and then I can go back and save Brian!
I have to track down a titanium capacitor for a high-wattage mainframe I'm going to construct.
I know, but the one guy who made those drew a doodle of Mohammed, so he's not around anymore.
Oh, dear, Rupert, without those capacitors, it'll be completely impossible to build a functioning time machine.
Oh, boy, this is, um... this is probably the worst pain I've ever had to go through, and I've sprained my ankle twice.
He was smart, he was loyal, and I guess what I'm trying to say is he was like a brother to me.
Can we at least get rid of the doggie door so Chris doesn't keep getting stuck in it?
You know, I hate to say it, but I-I'm starting to think the only way to stop missing Brian is to get a new dog.
I know it might take time to find the right dog, but I really feel like it might be the best way for us to move on.
Look, I miss Brian more than any of you, but at least now no one's forcing us to watch those awful PBS documentaries.
So, with the exception of not being able to go out in the sun, you're completely normal?
Maybe sometime you could take me on a ride-along with you, show me the neighborhood.
Did you just speak ill of the man who busts his tail providing for you?
I'm going to tell Vinny so much bad news about Italian-Americans that he goes into cardiac arrest.
Everyone in this family is so damn thrilled with you, they've forgotten all about Brian.
Look, Stewie, I know it doesn't seem like it now, but you're gonna be okay.
It was just him and me in a tiny apartment, and we got pretty tight.
He tried to go to a yoga class, and on the first pose, his ball sack split in half.
I kind of sensed you were all going through the same feelings of loss that I was.
I accidentally made eye contact with a transvestite at a bar, and he followed me home.
So, Quagmire, if you're some kind of big ladies' man, how come I never see you wearing a necklace?
So, as you can see, the fiscal projections for the fourth quarter make this thing a slam dunk.
Okay, what do you got for a lyric? I put a booger on a painting at the museum.
Guys, I'm trying to do something up here that works better if I don't hear men singing!
I'd like a sandwich, but I don't feel like eating two whole loaves of bread.
That was beautiful. And it must be original, because I know every song about money, and I've never heard that one before.
Although, I-I don't have as cavalier an attitude toward my debt as the song suggests.
They could give me five years salary, tax free, and it wouldn't put a dent in my problem.
I even managed Earth, Wind, Fire & Pollen for a little while, but I had to give it up.
Hey, do I have time to get a drink at the water fountain where the water does not crest above the dispenser?
The promoters of the New England Music Festival saw it, and they want to book you!
If you randomly stumble upon an amazing talent, and then someone important sees it by wild coincidence, great things can happen without any hard work.
A singer, huh? You as good as the guys who sing Happy Birthday at Macaroni Grill?
Rupert and I are just having a spritzer and some cheese in advance of the performance.
Anyway, a bunch of us got together and beat him with a grill lid and windshield wipers, and let's just say, uh, he don't do chick stuff no more.
I don't know. Soon thereafter, a girl in the neighborhood married a black guy, so we all kind of turned our attention to that.
And to think, just last week, my only creative outlet was picking hockey fights at work.
Our company's gonna be around for at least three more weeks, and we want to sign you.
Look, I'm sorry for being a jerk, and letting a little fame go to my head.
Yeah. The doorknob was really hot, but I just let go instead of holding onto it.
And there's some ice on the stairs to the basement, so I guess just don't go down there.
You know, the best thing about the Quahog Mall is going into Tiffany's and doing everything possible to make 'em think I might actually buy something.
Oh, and these watches here, if I wanted to get 11 of them for different groomsmen, could they each get engraved individually?
I want something I can wear on the street that a broad can smell on a fire escape.
Turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy who knows a girl, which is weird because they don't usually know nothin', who says the carnival was canceled by the mall's owner, some guy named Carter Pewterschmidt.
Oh! Excuse me, I'm just gonna have to Oh this out until I'm not surprised anymore.
Lois, before I get mad at your dad, h-he isn't the Little Caesars guy, is he?
Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.
The nerve of your dad, takin' the fun out of Christmas, like some kind of gluten-free Santa.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, there's a man here who says he's the guy whose picture is on all the money.
That's right, and this is my own People magazine from home and not from your waiting room just now, and why did you cancel the Christmas Carnival?
I am gonna help you find the Christmas spirit so you bring back the carnival.
My father was drowned to death in a birdbath by an officer of the law.
I mean, I know Stewie was disappointed about the carnival, but he'll get over it.
You know, I know I'm usually all business, but deep down, you know what the thing is that keeps me going more than anything else?
Thought I'd see how you like it when someone breaks into your house and touches all your stuff.
All right, Carter, now, you know what's guaranteed to put you in the holiday mood?
And keep in mind, it's traditional to embellish a little bit to make yourself look better. Peter had a great year, and is now starting quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Yeah, who has the time? Keep reading. Chris refurbished a vintage motorcycle, and Stewie can slam-dunk a basketball from a standing start...
Read what it says about you. Lois's father, Carter Pewterschmidt, bought a small stool for his balls.
Now, everyone knows the best way to get the Christmas spirit is to drink a whole lot of thick, frothy eggnog.
Good, now go down to the hotel lobby and check out with nog all over your face.
You know, I still don't like Christmas, but I kind of like what we just did.
Okay, Carter, a big part of Christmas is masturbating like you would any other day but feeling guilty about it because it's Christmas.
You're next up to see the big guy himself and you look like a piece of spaghetti on the street.
I don't know. I thought having the carnival back would make me happy, but it still feels like something's missing.
She had a look, but when you got up close, she also had a smell.
Hey, whose leg do you gotta gagoosh to get an Amaretto Di Saronno around here?
Yup. Let me read you an expert. You wish you were a millionaire. You want more money. Guess what. You blew it. You wish you could change the neighborhood. You want to be a selectman. You blew it. You wish you could open up a restaurant. You did not want to pay protection money. Knock, knock. Who's there?
Look, I appreciate all this, Vinny, but there's only one Brian, and it's tough for me that he's gone, especially around the holidays.
To the beach, a wedding on the beach, beach graduation, beach funeral, business conference which could be at a beach, a stroll through the park, should that park be adjacent to a beach.
All right, I better get out of these professor clothes before I kick my own ass.
What kid wouldn't want to play with these? Baa. What are you lookin' at? Not much, that's what I'm lookin' at. You want to have a go? I'd watch what I say with that other sheep right behind you.
Course, I had to do it with ashtrays, but I think the sheep is better.
Trust me, I think I know you well enough to know how to distract the other you.
This may sound a little presumptuous of me, but, uh, you ever do any modeling?
You know, my friends ask me, Stewie, why do you throw up after every meal?
The other you is in the back changing into a pair of tap shoes, for some reason.
Excellent. Now all I've got to do is set the coordinates to the moment before Brian got killed and I can save him.
You realize if I save Brian, my family won't get another dog, which means we will never have met.
Okay, Brian, I'm just putting this out there, but I'm a baby and only dicks don't let babies win.
You know, usually, I'd be sitting inside writing, you'd be working on one of your machines.
Yes, but luckily, I ran into another me from the past, so I stole his return pad and came back here.
You know, a whole lot of other families would've just gotten a different dog and moved on.
Now you don't have to ask me if everything is hot before you touch it.
Last night, I heard, uh, the song Pour Some Sugar On Me, and-and this question popped into my head.
Are you-- and please say yes-- are you related-- and even if you're not, please say yes-- are you related to-- and please say yes because I need the attention from my friends-- are you related to Def Leppard?
Well, that and I can work on my verbal sound effects and not feel self-conscious about the ones that aren't quite there yet.
Yeah, Frank retired, and since you're already required to wear a helmet here-- which, by the way, put on your helmet.
I guess this means I can afford to set up this cutaway with a fancy new transition.
You know, I always thought I could chug that, but I never tried 'cause I figured I couldn't lift it.
Now, I know it's picture day, but we can't afford them anymore, so just run behind another kid when they're getting their picture taken.
You know, actually, Peter, there's a lot of job training programs sponsored by the state that could help you get the skills you need for another occupation.
This is the raw material of a picture of life that I'm gonna paint with words.
I don't know, I just thought it would be cool to decide which kids do and don't get hit by a car.
I guess you should; and that'll give me more time to focus on expanding my record collection.
No, Peter, if I'm gonna be out of the house working, you're gonna have to take over for me in the house.
No, I mean, you're gonna need to cook the meals and do laundry and take care of Stewie, like I've been doing.
Oh, yes, we have a wide selection of balls that are way too heavy or have too-small finger holes.
Uh, no, you will not be able to do anything with your wrist for seven days afterward.
Yes, sir, all of the joysticks in the arcade are completely covered in pizza grease, no worries there.
Oh, absolutely, there is always a group of teenagers throwing the ball real hard and scaring everyone.
All right, kids, you are really gonna love these Cornish game hens I cooked for dinner.
Now, I don't want to pat myself on the back, but I worked all day getting 'em just right...
Yeah, well, let's take off our shoes and try to keep it that way, huh?
I barely had time to put on a nice sweater and clasp a cup of tea with two hands.
Well, look at it this way, Peter: without sex, you'll have more time to do the things you've always wanted to do.
All right, Peter, now, when it comes to curing impotence, sometimes you have to get creative.
Well, basically, some dirtbag from Boston yells at your junk to scare it into working again.
And he did some serious time for throwing a turkey off a bridge into a car.
Hold on, Peter. You didn't start having trouble in the bedroom until you lost your job, right?
Nice try, but I'm not the one who drove a forklift into a conference room and sent two people to the hospital.
And I could stand here and give you a big speech about second chances and promise to work harder than ever before.
And I could remind you that one day you might be in my shoes and maybe you'll need a second chance.
I'm gonna cash in this coupon you gave me last Valentine's Day. One Redo For Being Fired For Gross Negligence. And One Hug.
Those three guys broke in, beat up the father with a croquet mallet, and then stole the baby, and nobody knows where the baby is now?
You know, if you could spin straw into gold or-or maybe meth, I wouldn't need a job.
Look, le-let's just admit we both kind of got our wires crossed, and commit to being clearer in the future.
Like when you were supposed to be babysitting Georgie Porgie and his sleazy brother Rick Porgie.
I knew you'd be mad, so I've asked the band Heart to explain these beans in a way you can dreamily digest.
I-I was hoping they'd change a few more words to pertain to our situation, but I-I-I'm just happy they did this.
Tomorrow I want you to go back out there and look for a job that pays actual money.
Ah, damn it! I need to see that so I can make curds and whey.
It's odd that you would speak gibberish of your own choosing and not make it rhyme.
So, the lesson there is if you steal, you better be ready to murder, too.
So I got out of the car to take a leak, because I'd been drinking, and I didn't know it was next to a children's park.
Well, she was my ex-girlfriend, and I believed I was due an explanation about why she was such a  whore.
All right, well, I'm off to my grandmother's, but before I go, I better take a deep-woods dump.
You know, I'm not sure if that's our hero or just a lunatic going house to house murdering people.
A long time ago, in a magical, faraway land, several women lived together and, surprise, surprise, they didn't exactly get along.
You just keep scrubbing that poo spot so I can come back and poo on that spot again.
Well, I don't, I don't know what that was, but th-the first one has a parchment from the Charmings.
Oh, you know, I-I have an eye for fashion, and I'm pretty good with my hands.
Cinderella, I am your fairy godmother. Fairy in the magical sense, not about kissing guys.
All these royal types are inbreeding, walleyed, bucktooth monsters who have to be wheeled around under a blanket.
These are my daughters, and they will do anything to be your princess, right, girls?
And so the prince searched all over the kingdom for the foot that fit the glass slipper.
He skipped the, uh, south side of town, which, uh, even in fairy tale times, was, um... let's just say loud.
I can't wait to make love to you a hundred years before the invention of toilet paper.
And so, two people who danced together one time entered into an ill-advised, long-term relationship.
And they lived happily ever after for seven months and then separated with the goal of fixing themselves and getting back together.
Yeah, I mean, it's just too bad that all the-the animals are so spread out, you know?
I mean, wouldn't it be awesome if-if they were all grouped together, like in a cafeteria, and you could just go in there with a trench coat and just waste them?
Well, maybe I can stir up some quail or pheasant with my patented bird calls.
A writer who inherits a magic typewriter that writes for him, but then it turns out the typewriter is... racist?
The last thing he needs is a father who's, you know, sometimes there, sometimes not.
Hey, if I click ignore, will he know that I'm sending him to voice mail?
I know we haven't talked in a while, but I'm calling because I'm on my way to Quahog.
And I haven't seen him in years, and at this point, I-I just don't see what could possibly be gained from me getting together with him.
In entertainment news, Hollywood comes to Quahog in the form of a new Disney Channel show called Parent Boppers, about a group of teen detectives.
The show, set and filmed right here in Rhode Island, stars local teen and Irish trash Dylan Flannigan.
It's-it's almost like the universe is trying to I don't know, make us work together or something, I don't know.
I want to stick my head through a circle at the beginning of movies and roar.
We now return to Saving Private Ryan, brought to you without commercial interruption by Mazda.
Jerome, can you tell that to  get the hell out of here before I kick him in the face?
Joe, I got a deck of cards you can put in your wheels to look cool.
You made me dribble on my Bruno Maglis turning to see who's calling my name!
Tell my assistant I fell asleep with a condom on again, and to bring scissors to my trailer.
But would a good friend not return a leaf blower for four months during the leafy season?
I'm sorry, Peter, it's just that Quagmire's been there for me in some pretty dark days.
Hold on, other kids. Maybe they just recognize that nothing can protect us from the tedium of our mundane lives.
Dad, believe me, I want you to work here with me, but you can't keep doing things like that.
Oh, hey, by the way, are we all getting those backpacks with the name of the show on them?
It's-it's like Dylan just held a mirror up to me, and I could finally see how poorly I'd been treating him.
I guess I didn't realize how lucky I was to have Dylan back in my life until I lost him all over again.
Yeah, you know, you probably would've had a better shot if you hadn't yelled For this!
Well, okay, but that means you're in charge of getting Mr. Devlin to admit that after 30 years, he still loves Mrs. Devlin very much.
Hey, Lois, if I was gonna kill myself, do I slit my wrists this way or this way?
In this scene, DJ Slopes is thinking of quitting the detective agency, and you're like, No way.
Listen, Tevin, I think I just need more time to focus on my snowboarding and Web series about energy drinks.
It's like you held a mirror up to him and he could finally see how poorly he'd been treating you.
Stay on me, camera one. ...to have you back in his life, and now he feels like he's lost you all over again.
You know, I don't know where any of that came from, but I liked it.
I need you to shoot me in the arm so we can be friends again.
No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture.
But-but just the fact that I would make the offer is so meaningful to you.
The only thing that means anything to me is a bullet in your arm. Now give me that!
Look, I was trying to do the decent thing, like you'd see in a movie!
See, they took all these colors and they're making 'em all live together in a beach house.
So, as you can see, our quarterly output is up one and a half percent.
And now, 23 minutes of silence for the 23 workers who drowned in the vats this year.
This was supposed to be and there's kind of a lot of conversation going on.
I'm sure you also heard that someone walked into my office while I was sucking on my own toes.
I understand I've made hundreds of deadly enemies by shouting racial taunts up at the jailhouse windows.
All right, well, I'm gonna go confuse everyone on Facebook with a, So sad, terrible day status and nothing more.
And I can't believe this funeral home has a skylight with a sinister clown staring down at us.
My mother always hoped to be buried with her pet cat, Mittens, so I'd like to thank the Quahog Veterinary Society for putting Mittens down so quickly.
Yeah... a-and maybe she can be my new mom, you know, just like Greg Evigan and Paul Reiser were briefly my two dads.
Geez, you know, I gotta say, it's weird to see you so worked up about this.
So that side of the building was donated by someone named, Get Out of Our Town?
No, I-I-I think that was the work of some shaved-headed gentleman, but, but we're here to talk about Judaism.
I think your whole religion is a sham, just so you can get extra holidays off from work.
Buddhism is an Asian religion that also has a significant following of annoying white people.
See, these guys believe that after you die, you're reincarnated and you come back as a pig or a cow or a rooster.
But they also don't believe in demonstrating emotions either way, so they're the worst people to buy birthday gifts for.
I know you've been having trouble getting around, so I bought you a new Lexus.
Now, the Catholics believe that as long as you accept Jesus before you die, anyone can get into Heaven.
Peter, thank you so much for your help in making this cake, but don't you think it would be easier if you stood on the floor?
I-I asked that guy over there, but he just told me a bunch of rhyming nonsense.
Yeah, sure, just let me just go check my room full of gold and jewels.
Well, I just think it's pretty clear that we're all just bags of bones and flesh that eventually break down and decay into worm food.
There were still crumbs in the corners of her mouth from that Nilla Wafer she had at lunch.
I mean, this wouldn't be the first time you thought someone was hitting on you.
While he's getting all the glory, John Q. Taxpayer is left to clean up the crumbs.
No, Evelyn, I trusted you, and all this funny business keeps happening, and I don't think it's your medicine at all.
You said it yourself, when we die, there's nothing! We just rot in the ground!
Look, Stewie, I know you're worried, but you can't live your life being scared of death.
Nobody knows what comes next, so all we can do is pack the most we can into each day we've got.
You know, ever since you turned into a rock with your name on it, your friend's been really inappropriate with me.
It's just that since my beloved Walter died, you're the first man who's paid any attention to me, and I guess I took advantage of that.
I missed my mom so much, and I guess maybe I sort of used you as a replacement.
Lois, I know how many beers I can drink and still be able to drive.
Okay, my Great-Uncle-wears a-ski-hat-all-the-time Griffin will be followed by Nick Nolte's handkerchief, followed by Japanese Abe Lincoln, and then monkey rabbi.
Now, I see some elements of Red Rover with a little bit of spud mixed in.
And it looks like Williams is pulling up his shirt and having a little fun with his tummy!
With a five-point lead and only ten seconds left, all the Patriots have to do is kneel down with the ball, and the game is... Oh, my God, it's a fumble!
Yeah, like that one where I walk into the bank, and I ain't got no clothes on.
We now return to Turner Classic Movies' presentation of John Wayne's final Western, Big Bill Doyle.
John Wayne only ate beef and coffee for every meal, so the director had to shoot around the fact that he was on the toilet all the time.
Well, we just gelled as a team today, and was fortunate to come away with the win.
I'd like to thank God and a jury of my peers, who are both responsible for me being able to play today.
Come on, don't you notice that whenever the Patriots lose, the other team always thanks God?
How many times is God gonna ruin our Sunday with both church and bad football?
It's time someone told God to stay where He belongs-- in our schools, and-and telling people where they can stick their wieners.
Peter, the idea of God, let alone that he'd care anything about football, is absurd.
Well, it's absurd to think that my hand scratching on the couch is some kind of animal, but you do.
Okay, this is God's house, so we'll just go in there, talk to Him, and take care of this whole thing.
Hey, in that song, Jesus, Take the Wheel, was that, like, the real Jesus, or was it just some Mexican guy?
Look, you guys, I don't know who you are, but I have to go perform.
All right, look, maybe I'm not like other football fans, but I don't have a fulfilling career and a rich family life.
I don't know where they're getting all this weed. In Greece, it was commonly held that one could speak to the gods from the top of Mount Olympus.
All right, what better place to find God than the birthplace of all of Western civilization's great religions and one really mean one.
Yeah, plus I left my Jacuzzi on the whole time, came home to a boiled raccoon.
Look, God, the reason we're here is we wanted to tell you to stop messing with the Patriots!
You really think I'd get involved with football games when there's people dying in Africa?
You don't, like, pay attention to how much each individual tips at each meal, right?
But they live to watch football, many of them still on Zenith or Sylvania television sets.
And your mommy said that she'll be able to Skype at 8:30 if drinks don't turn into dinner.
And if there's one thing that always gets me to smile, it's a child's laughter.
So, I found this kid in the parking lot, and I'm gonna make him laugh for you.
All right, Coach, now one thing that's always funny is when I dub my voice over animal footage and introduce human foibles into their situations.
Look, you guys have been following me around all day making fools out of yourselves.
Our friend Joe here has to have his fluids changed every 72 hours, or else he swells up and his eyes turn yellow.
Last week, the handicapped seat on the bus was taken, so they put me on the front, like a bicycle.
After I injured my legs, my doctor said I'd be walking again in two weeks.
Aw, man, this is my biggest accomplishment since my 1920s solo flight across the Atlantic.
All right, we got to put toilets in these things if we're gonna be in 'em for more than two hours.
Well, Peter, I'm glad you're home, and I'm happy you guys found what you were looking for.
Yeah, and this trip made me realize that 98% of the world is just making each other blankets.
Every time we go to Disney World, he thinks Mickey Mouse just happened to be there that day.
But, Peter, I still don't understand why you would go to all that trouble to find God and only ask about the Patriots.
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Peter, you know, i-it might help Chris to be able to spend some time with his father.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
I can't go. I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
It is true that I did not step away, but I did not lean in.
I can't sleep, I-I just have to lie here and wait for my stupid leg to heal.
Wow, he's really fast. Hey, I got an idea, let's put in two different orders and have 'em race!
You know, if you're not gonna show up to rehearsal, we'll find someone else who will, all right?
Now, let's play I Fell in the Shower, So Maybe We Do Need That Bar.
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal. Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
I have decided to change my will, and name my grandson Chris the sole heir to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
I know it's strange, but in the end it's his money, so who really cares?
Of course not, Lois, but even you can't deny it was always gonna be a huge perk.
Yeah, I thought so, but then it just sounded kind of weird when I said it.
So if you ask me, we got to start sucking up to Chris right away.
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
I don't know. I-I just kind of felt like this is what cool people wear.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay. Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub, fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
MAN (on TV): We now return to the director's cut of Mission: Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
I am gonna show you a film comedy from my youth that won't hold up.
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Ugh, I am. I've been busting my ass for the last week trying to suck up to Chris.
You know what? I say, good for Chris and whatever lucky girl he ends up marrying.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, I want to take this to the next level.
No, no, no, that's just all of human history except for the last five months.
It's time to settle down and simplify things, like maybe having one ATM card and one bank account.
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
It's a petition to force that hot mom to wear something appropriate at PTA meetings.
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
Excellent. Do you have a table for the couple that barely made it through the weekend without breaking up?
Absolutely. Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Sure. And maybe they could go next to the vastly-underdressed cousin who thinks the world revolves around him?
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever, Stars And Stripes Forever by John Philip Sousa.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
It was nice of the guests at the cat funeral to stay for our wedding.
Welcome, friends, loved ones, and people who are waiting for the 3:00 check-in time with nothing better to do.
New England scumbags like me know: Robert Frost. Two roads diverged in a wood, and I...
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
Wait, so you mean to tell me, if I ever want to get out of something, all I got to do is take a smoke break?
You put them in there, and they swim like hell for, like, 30 seconds, and then they go to sleep.
I can't believe I'm moving tomorrow, and I won't get to see how this works out.
The intruder has tracked in a red clay, which can only be found near London's homosexual bathhouse.
You know, Peter, it's so nice that after all these years we've been together, we can still... Smoke break!
I just need a couple every hour or so, so I don't go completely insane.
You know, I feel like these waffles could use a little fresh air. Come on, boys.
I know it's technically not illegal, but it seemed wrong when your music teacher wrapped a trash bag around his waist so he could change pants.
Well, you know, at first it was a way to get out of work, but then I discovered it's a delightful habit that has lots of benefits. Yeah? Like what?
First off, we have a new rule: no more asking the gym teachers if they went to college.
I guess we should go to the Stop Smoking Clinic and then maybe get a couple bottles of wine.
The good news is, I've taught you everything you need to know to fend for yourself.
There is one catch: if you're gonna be our spokesman, you have to keep smoking.
Hey, Peter, now that you're a celebrity, could I get a picture of you to put on the wall?
I'll put you up next to these black celebrities who are just confusing strangers to you.
Oh, hey, uh, you know, I don't know if you're the guy to talk to about this, but when I went to my trailer this morning, there was a hairy naked guy in it.
Come on. Let's go kidnap my neighbor's dog and tell them we don't have it.
First of all, I don't care what the courts say, let's thank the Christian god together.
You were being bullied day in and day out, so I tried to help you.
And now an opening statement from our second candidate, the King of the Zingers, Chris Griffin.
Well, I may no longer be on your back, but I'll always be on your side.
Yeah, Lois is right. As bad as you look, the damage you've done to your heart and your lungs is, no doubt, exponentially worse. What?!
He, like, threw me down and he said, I hope your puppeteer has big hands, because I'm not using lube.
You know, Lois, physicists believe there are two alternate universes: one in which I don't open the box and one in which I do.
Wow, I haven't felt this powerful since I got to decide which ant lives and which ant dies.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up that Peter has a whip, because, well, you know, given your racial heritage, it seems like something you might want to keep an eye out for.
I know this is very risky, but the upside is so good, I'm taking it.
Well, it's an ancient ritual where two friends intermingle their blood, thus sealing a bond even deeper than friendship.
I am going to be the cutest fire hydrant in the whole... Aah! What are you doing?!
Hey, are-are you blood brothers with Meg because you ate her tampon out of the trash?
Uh, hey, listen, this is, uh, a little awkward, but, uh, you guys are sitting in our booth.
That's right, we see you losers anywhere near this booth, and we'll bust your kneecap.
All right, I was hoping it wouldn't have to come to this, but... you fellas are in big trouble.
All right, bitches, either you tuck your little wangs between your legs and waddle out of here or we're gonna beat the crap out of you.
Yeah, but, you know, I mean, isn't the worst thing about herpes just the stigma?
You know, my uncle was in the Army, and he got genital boppo from a Saigon whore...
So, I was thinking, I know they're kind of overused lately... but your colors should be, like, yellow and gray.
You know, I've always been against destination weddings, but it's nice to finally see Denver.
That's very cute, Stewie, but if I let you dress up like Héctor Elizondo, I have to let everyone.
I bought one of those crippled-guy robot suits from Avatar, so now I can be on top.
I heard about what happened at the Clam, and I'm not interested in having sex with a quarter of a man.
Everybody heard about what happened over at the Clam and how those guys made you their bitch.
Long enough to know you have herpes and do weird stuff with your teddy bear.
Please tell me this isn't still about how you punked out in front of those guys at the Clam.
Peter, I want you to march down to the Clam right now and get your booth back.
And these two barbecue scumbags formed a lifelong friendship until their deaths at the ripe old age of 52 in separate ATV accidents.
Yes, thank you, we'll take the table in the corner, next to the herpes dog.
Wow, you must be such a good person to knowingly go out with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.
If you bastards want our booth, you got to go through us to get it.
If we don't stand up for ourselves now, we'll regret it for the rest of our lives.
All right, guys, I know this looks desperate, but I've got this can of spinach.
So, if you want this booth, you're gonna have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.
I want to drive your Prius to the end of the block all by myself.
I want to go on a date with Neve Campbell so I can give her a nice ladle of Stew.
It was a rotten thing to do, and I promise I will never lie to you again.
Now, you'll be watching Stewie, and I don't want you just to prop him up next to the TV all day.
Oh, my God, it's only been five minutes, and I'm already bored out of my mind.
Oh, I was quite sure it was just one from the size of the car!
Peter, they threw what I thought was a bucket of water on me, but it turns out, it was just a bunch of confetti!
The doctor says it's as if our breasts have been X-rayed five hours a day, every day, for the last three years!
H-Hey, it's hard to hear you over the sound of joyful children in the park.
Hey, what happened to my new friend, that kid who sort of looks like me from behind?
Now, what do you say we all sit down and watch this Weird Al Yankovic documentary?
Peter, I have put up with your nonsense for 20 years, but today you crossed a line.
Griffin, I'm not gonna look over there until you first assure me you've got pants on.
Um, I don't know about any of that, but I think I should eat something.
But that-that other stuff, they all sound like the kind of things I could do to expand my horizons.
I got to wonder-- I'm sure you do, too-- how this thing didn't crack when they were carving out her downstairs business.
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer for every business trip, and see all the great stuff that's out there.
My brain is awash with theorems and profundity and abstractions that I can pontificate upon at length.
This is our new bookshelf, and I think you'll find it has more channels than any TV we've ever owned.
Perhaps you'd like to hear about Jane Eyre, who felt quite the new girl at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.
Well, Lois, some of it came from books, some came from museums, and, honestly, a lot of it just came from travel.
Peter, what gives? Ever since you had all those business trips, you've been acting weird.
All right, if this is to be a smart family, we will have to learn not to giggle at smart things that sound dirty but are not.
And tonight is the night I meet with other members of my form twelve learning mates to celebrate the exactly two groupings of ten years ago.
I need to know how to use these words in sentences by the time Peter gets home.
Oh, that should be easy. Just give me the word, and I'll put it in a sentence for you. Anodyne.
Wait, I thought this was what you always wanted-- for Peter not to be an idiot.
If visiting San Francisco and New York made Peter smart, maybe if we send him to the dumbest city in the whole country, it'll bring back the old Peter.
When you're done with that, can you help me plug the hole in this dike?
And then happy birthday is all blurry, because whoever opens the card is 40 and you want to give them the impression that their eyes are starting to go.
You know, Chris, Usher categorizes his girls into two groups: bitches he's with and bitches he's gonna get with.
I-I figured the day you came home with a girl, we'd have to back her through the garage.
Now, let's go see your mom's done listing all the black people she's ever seen on television.
Look, I think if you got to know us better, you wouldn't have any problem with your daughter dating one of us.
Look, why don't you and Pam come over tomorrow night, a-and you'll see that white people are even better than black people.
Jerome, you have done a wonderful job raising Pam to be a lovely young woman.
Sounds like you're saying a single black man can't raise a child on his own.
You know, before I speak, I like to ask myself, Would Dr. King approve of what I'm about to say?
Yeah, I was just trying to say we all appreciate having you in our home.
White guys don't want a relationship with black women-- they just want a notch on their belt.
Look, Jerome, I-I know you think we're all terrible, but white people have done a lot of good things for the world.
Straight up. You ain't swervin' with him, you ain't gonna shump-a-jump, you're not hollerin' at him, you ain't his shorty or his boo.
Okay, but all I know about sex is from Internet porn, so I'm very excited to try buffering.
Then I'll leave you alone to get undressed and under the covers, and I'll be right back.
Pam, this may come as a surprise to you, but I am not an experienced lover.
I own a business, I pay my taxes, and yet I got to deal with this crap every time I step outside my house.
I don't mind having you in my bar, man, but it's different when it's your baby girl.
Forgive me for being a protective father, but white people have exploited and mistreated blacks for centuries, and I'm not gonna let that happen to Pam.
I realize he's a good man who has reason to be a little suspicious of Whitey.
Jerome is right. White is white, black is black-- got to keep the races completely separate.
Just 'cause I've experienced some hard times doesn't mean this generation can't teach us a thing or two.
All right, if these kids want to date, then I guess that's okay with me.
Welcome, all, to James Woods High's annual college fair, where each year, our seniors gather to decide where they will go in the fall to get HPV.
That is tough, but once you're in there, you'd be surprised how much you like it.
I always thought she was gonna be one of those ladies who wears a jean jacket and hangs out at the bar in a chain restaurant.
Yeah, she's a solid B student and that's quite an accomplishment, considering none of her teachers are willing to sleep with her.
Anyway, I was able to get Meg an interview this weekend at Green Mountain College in Vermont.
Yes, you do. You have that wicker basket in the laundry room with the frayed bath mat in it.
I-I'll tell you where there definitely aren't any meatball subs-- the side pocket of my golf bag.
No! I was so cold. And you have no idea how many terrifying things there are out here in the dark.
It's not his fault. He was a great gumball machine-- they just shouldn't have promoted him.
From you. Dad, I've been hearing that song in the backseat of your car since I was a little kid.
Thanks to you, Dr. Griffin, my bunion is healed and I can walk without pain.
Boy, after all this food, we're gonna have a couple of night moves back at the motel later, huh, Dad?
Uh, Night Moves, Like a Rock, Shakedown, The Fire Down Below. Against the Wind was him poopin' out of a car.
Um, I think we all know the answer to this, but should I get tested?
By the way, if a girl named Rachel calls, it's a wrong number, but do tell me that she called.
Meg, I'm glad you're having a good time with your father, but don't let him distract you from your priorities.
Awesome. Come on, let's go next door and get your mom a funny refrigerator magnet.
Meg, you've probably wondered from time to time how on earth I pay for all my shenanigans.
But a part of growing up is learning how to handle a tough situation on your own, like getting into college or breaking up with your father.
You see, living in the wild, I-I've realized that all the pain I've ever had in my life has-has come from me always trying to be something I'm not.
A few months back, I got really drunk and was playing around with an elastic band.
I wrapped it around my thigh and forgot about it for a week or two and uh, yeah, so, that's my left foot now.
You know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show.
I think a lot of times you only say things because they make you sound good.
You know, Cleveland, it must be weird for you guys to move and not 'cause of a hurricane.
Now Peter will have something to do besides flushing the toilet to Foghat's Slow Ride.
Turns out this old house is lacking in storage space, so I gotta make some tough decisions.
Uh, please take the potty seat off the toilet, don't try to pee through it.
There's juice boxes in the fridge and if you get hungry, there's plenty of Goldfish in the couch.
And the kids will be down here first thing in the morning to antagonize the dogs.
Oh, and everyone here has pinkeye. ...And that was the moment I stopped being Dwayne Johnson and started being The Rock.
I was playing with Rallo and I broke a vase and then she gave me a spanking!
And then you pushed real hard and the poo came through the rib eye hole?
What I do is throw a shot put into a crowd and make it look like an accident.
The only thing kids learn from spanking is adults don't have the patience to teach them.
From now on, I don't want our families having anything to do with each other!
Well, Cleveland, looks like these two little alley cats have scrapped it out. I'll see you tomorrow.
No, our wives got in a big fight and banned us from seeing each other.
Why you thought it was appropriate to show up here, Cheryl, I have no idea.
I just figured a plane is a safe place where you and I can hang out and not be seen by our wives.
Hey, Cleveland, this is just so we can talk without getting spotted by Lois and Donna.
When Clinton was in the White House, all you needed to vote was a piece of duct tape and a...
The other day, my wife asked me if her ass looked fat in her jeans.
I mean, I'm the guy who figured out how much eye contact a band should make during a guitar solo.
All right, Cleveland, nothing bonds women together like having to take care of invalid husbands in the hospital.
Well, women will always band together to stop an offensive art exhibit from coming to town.
So I've arranged for all my photos of baby wieners to be put on display.
And they're time-stamped as far back as 1998, which is way before we had this idea!
And I'm telling you, Cleveland and I have won every three-legged race in Quahog except that time those two one-legged guys formed the perfect running person.
And if we're gonna be neighbors, we're gonna have to learn to set aside our differences.
You know, Cleveland, I got to say, it's great having the old gang back together again.
Being born into it was clearly some sort of cosmic mistake, so I'm going back in time to prevent that mistake.
I'm going to break up Lois and the fat man before they can conceive me.
Look, Stewie, I know you're angry about last night, but you're talking about erasing your existence.
Oh, and by the way, thanks for asking me if I wanted something from Subway, too.
Karen Washington from the Rhode Island Zoo and some rejected toys you're not gonna believe.
All right, Rupert, time to break up Lois and the fat man before they can conceive me by pressing butts together.
None of my attempts to break them up has worked thus far, so I had to up our game.
So I've got to tell you one thing: you know that song I wrote you for Valentine's Day?
Ooh, I wonder if I'll have one of those pug-nosed British dogs that licks its own snot all day.
This is your valet, your gardener, your cook, your gamekeeper, your butler, your housekeeper, your parlor maid, your housemaid, your scullery maid, your shoe de-graveler and one superfluous employee who I am not in a gay relationship with.
This will be our last physical contact until I give you a firm handshake on your 18th birthday.
My heavens, my father is the Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire,
Dean of Physics at Oxford, and he was pre-approved for a Capital One No-Hassle Card.
Jaden was first form in his sixth levels and he's chief scrum-flanker on his varsity boogling team, which, as far as we know, makes us terribly proud.
Stewart, I think your mouth is better at taking things in than spewing them out.
Well, I did at first, but then he's got the tea vouching for him, doesn't he?
All right, Rupert, I left the fat man's entire porn collection on the curb for Goodwill to pick up.
You successfully prevented your own birth, and instead you were born into an alternate family.
You're right! And if I know her, she'll be heading to the fridge for her angry afternoon Chardonnay.
With smooth lips, I will finally be able to be a mayor who kisses babies with confidence!
Oh, yeah, I knew them two was hummus the minute they walked in the door.
I call my comic For Pete's Sake, because it points out things that make you shake your head and say, For Pete's sake.
Hey, how about one where you draw a sock, and it says Sock it to me, or-or maybe draw Lois taking a hot-tub dump, and she just says whatever?
We're talking to Peter Griffin, the artist behind For Pete's Sake, which has caused outrage with a misogynistic comic.
Mr. Griffin, do you really think this is an appropriate cartoon to run on Gloria Steinem's half-birthday?
I just want to turn in my last For Pete's Sake. going out on top amid a flurry of gambling rumors.
For this leg of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash.
Although, I got to say, you never get to see somebody else driving your car.
I come from a country where the words for sewage and beverage are the same.
But if you want to save us a little time, you can start tracing his body with chalk.
Yeah, all right, well, with no contribution, your report goes right into the circular file.
I don't usually check this file, so it might be a while until we find that car of yours.
I love that! Is that a popular expression, like what the deuce? Probably more popular.
He doesn't need lasers or time machines, just gum balls and marbles and balls of string.
Why, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that...
Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?
So, you know, um, I'm only wearing this diaper as a dare, you know-- it's not, like, an everyday thing.
All right, Peter, if we're gonna find your car, we got to think like a car.
It was okay, but it would be a shame to waste such great butcher's arms on a musical instrument.
Okay, Santa's Little Helper got all tuckered out from his playdate, so he went out back to take a nap under that tree where nobody knows quite where it is.
Didn't find the car, Lois, but I found a good time with a good pal.
It may have been inspired by Duff, but I-I like to think it goes in a different direction.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I-I used to love Duff when I was younger, but I-I haven't even had it in, like, 13 years.
I represent the Duff Brewery, and you, sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement.
Your Honor, citizens of Springfield and visitors from Quahog, my client, the Duff Brewery, is the victim of flagrant intellectual theft.
Several other Duff variations, packages and design elements have been similarly infringed, resulting again and again in pale imitations, chp coes, clumsy counterfeits and weak substitutions.
Well, the Pawtucket Brewery will be shut down, so I guess we got to go back to Quahog and find Peter a new job.
Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice to meet you and your family, even though you kind of screwed us over.
And, hey, next time you stay with a family, maybe you can wear a bra some of the time.
Hey, uh, Marge, uh, listen, there's something difficult that I've been trying to figure out how to tell you, and, um... it's about, uh, Santa's Little Helper.
The inside of my hat smells so bad I'm not allowed in most restaurants... Hey, hey!
I know Apu's not your enemy, but I just wanted to say, I took Apu.
But now, I think I speak for all of us when I say, I am over the Simpsons!
And remember, kids, TV violence is fine as long as you don't show a nipple.
It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury...
Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore, but you are a local hero for defending our beer, and apparently, that's more important than hating women.
We lost a court case. Yes, we lost, but how are they gonna enforce it?
He was lame. If you ask me, he kind of sounded like a girl. Really?
He's obviously cleaning his feet in the pool without making it look like he's cleaning his feet in the pool.
I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great!
I've been working on this book for nine years, but I've been too afraid to show it to anybody.
It's about a handicapped squirrel who has to learn to overcome his disabilities so he can survive in the wild.
Hey, uh, you wouldn't maybe want to grab a bite to eat sometime, would you?
I am currently seeking online companionship as a short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman.
And I would love to attempt to convert my heavily embellished Internet profile and carefully airbrushed, out-of-date photo, into a night of physical intimacy with you...!
So there's gonna be a real live book out there with your name on it?
I was just thinking, since it's so nice out, we could go out for a run and then eat.
Uh, anyway, this is The Hopeful Squirrel. There once was a handicapped squirrel who could not climb trees to get food.
Okay, next page. The squirrel-- the same squirrel from the first page-- hoped that the other animals would share their food with him. 'Please,' said the Hopeful Squirrel. 'If you could all spare just one nut,
Mommy, I don't like the wheel man. But none of the other animals would share with the Hopeful Squirrel.
Joe, quick, give me the book. And so, the squirrel decided to climb for his own nuts. 'I don't need legs when I've got a positive attitude and arm strength.' 'I'm sorry that we mistreated you,' said Buddy the Badger. 'Could you find it in your heart to share your nuts with us?' 'Of course I'll share with you all,' said the squirrel. 'For if I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped.'
Listen, Joe, how would you feel about your friend getting more involved? What do you mean?
Well, you would write the books, and your friend, Peter, would be the public face of The Hopeful Squirrel.
Hot Rod asked for Mr. Chicago. Give me all your money. I have a gun?
I need to know that you're gonna take this seriously and honor the message of the book.
You know, I'd see these crippled kids limping down the sidewalk on my way to work, and I would just laugh and laugh, and I thought, Hey! Put that in a book!
But in the book, I'm drawn smooth down there, so it's not a bad question.
We invite you to stay tuned through the credits so you can see where I buy my clothes.
Okay. I'll mush some up and put it on the floor next to the trash, if you get hungry.
Uh... Captain, this uh... this is a little embarrassing, but, uh, you know, I've never noticed, uh, the little lever I've been pushing, it's... it's only about two-thirds of the way up.
I mean, think of how many crises we've been in where the issue was how fast we could go.
At the funeral, I literally said the words to his wife, I was giving her all she's got.
And besides, I'm the only one of the two of us who can do a squirrel voice.
I want nothing to do with the book, and I want nothing to do with you!
And on the same week when my sister and I are having such a big fight, too.
Like, if he's seeing something kooky, he could be like, Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!
Hey, how many of y'all bitches like to read? Chapter One. It was winter in the forest, so the squirrel was happy he'd built that hot tub. But little did he know, a strain of super gonorrhea was gonna hit him so fierce he'd wish he was still paralyzed from the waist down. On top of that, some son of a bitch killed his brother. The monkey's kick-ass buzz saw hand 'His brains, his brains-- they're everywhere!' the little girl yelled. 'Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!' ...exclaimed Billy the Bullfrog. The woodchuck mom and her baby finished their cocoa and then tucked in for another cozy night.
But then... 'Nothing but cops on the take and hookers on the make,' said Randy the Raccoon. 'What's a hooker?' asked the bunny, who was gay. 'That and a bag of crank is my Saturday night!' spat Randy.
Me trying to write a book is like CeeLo trying to find a pair of pants.
I know how much this meant to you, and I... I should've just stayed out of it.
I never would have had the confidence to get my book published in the first place.
Even though it might be a little bug digging away down there, just nagging and itching and...
We now return to Hotel TV, the station that makes you feel like you're at a hotel when you're not at a hotel.
Or you can watch the big game at Chopper's Bar and Grill, where they'll be pouring till 2:00 a.m.
And you won't have to, 'cause Chopper's is open, where they're pouring till 2:00 a.m.
Tragedy stuck Haiti today as the island nation was rocked by a major earthquake, leaving thousands dead and injured.
I've always talked about wanting to help in these situations, but I never follow through.
It's called Apathetic George. George used to be a curious monkey, but after a month in captivity, all he did was wait for food. The zoo people wanted him to mate, but he lost interest in that, too. 20 years and millions of dollars in zoo revenue later, he died.
If anybody needs me, I'll be poolside next to my weirdly hot girlfriend with dark teeth.
Peter, knock it off. Just give some blood, get your cookie and be done with it.
Well, I already ate two wedding cakes, but I guess I could go for a cookie.
Thanks, Lois, but you got to promise you'll warn me before they stick that needle in me.
Yeah, I found one of my grandmother's old recipes, so I thought I'd make a special batch for the blood drive.
Coming this fall to every network, your favorite sitcom lines preceded by the word uh.
I mean, I've seen that guy get punched in the face a thousand times, and now he's making science stuff.
Who'd think that idiot would still be walking around and Muhammad Ali can't even talk anymore?
All right! Now, let's turn up the TV real loud so the kids can't hear us having sex.
I mean, I had that job creating ads for the North Dakota board of tourism.
Imagine coming here and having Cool Dude or Yay Jews or Boo Jews, depending on where you stand on Jews.
You know, I've got to tell you, this stuff you gave me was a lifesaver last night.
And, you know, normally, I'm up five or six times to scream and defecate. But you know what?
Oh, Brian's all serious. Oh, I don't... I don't drink in the morning because I've got to land a plane.
You know, I've got all the papers for the loan officer, but, I got to admit, I'm a little nervous.
And if you get nervous, just do what I always do, picture your audience naked.
I'll be your loan officer, so why don't you have a seat and tell me about your business.
I've made a series of small poops in my bath, and I need you to scoop them out with this fishnet.
In fact, the only thing that would make me happier is... would... is... would be if this tub was filled with yawgurt.
All right. Well, we have got work to do, so let's roll up our sleeves and get right to it.
There's a lot to do, so we can't be afraid to just roll up our sleeves and get the job done.
Just roll up those sleeves and address the task at hand, whatever it may be, not shying away from the dirty work, but just rolling up our sleeves and having at it.
What, Mom? You promised I could get a cookie if I finished all my surgery.
It's that lady who comes in, tries a sample, and then whispers about how bad she is. Hey.
But at least I know I'm bad, so that makes me a little less bad.
I mean, if it doesn't pick up soon, we're not gonna stay in business very long.
We just got to think outside the box, like the makers of Dreyer's ice cream.
When people go to the supermarket, they need something to look at before they choose Haagen-Dazs.
I spend $600 a month on scented candles at the farmer's market just because there's a hot chick selling them.
This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.
I told her ten minutes ago to put another batch of oatmeal in the oven.
I know we made a few changes, but this store should still be about selling cookies.
I don't know why I ever let you talk me into this... this... whatever this is now.
I'll go first. Stewie, I remember the day you were born. I thought to myself, here's a kid who's got a white, empty canvas stretched out in front of him.
After you left, I ate cookie dough off the stomach of a 20-year-old, and then I vomited and all the girls laughed at me, and then it came out that they all think I'm fat and old.
Oh, back at the store, I, uh, tucked my boner into the waistband of my pants and now it's sitting weird.
I really liked having a store with you, and I'm... I'm sorry I messed it up.
Yeah, I know. It'd be better to put in that movie about the two girls who meet Nixon.
But if you also put in Edward Furlong's movie, Pecker, you got Pecker and Dick in the Glory hole, and you got a tight squeeze, but it-it ought to fit.
We got boat parts on the wall, so you know the crab comes from the ocean.
I thought I wanted to make that trade, but I don't want to make that trade.
No, Brian. The stupidest thing I ever did was turn the bubbles off in a hot tub.
Now, remember, Brian's probably very self-conscious about how he looks, so let's try to be supportive.
Brian, we can try to make you feel a little less repulsive, but we're not spending human money on a deformed animal.
Wow, this is the craziest meal I've had since I had lunch at Tommy Sullivan's house.
You may argue that this is a waste of energy, but to me, it's worth the comfort because, let's face it, the world is an abrasive place.
That is the best cosmetic surgery in this family since Lois got her boob job.
Now, I am obligated to disclose that the previous owners were murdered in this house.
Hello, Doctor? I need a new pair of eyes because clearly mine aren't seeing straight.
Is this the guy who wanted his pulse checked because he died and went to heaven?
The only thing is, anyone can sell a nice house, but a real star is someone who can sell a dump.
The one thing they're pretty firm about at the office is you don't take the inside deals and give them to your friends.
Come live in the kind of place a Persian guy would say is a little much.
But as your friend, I wanted to let you know early because there's another buyer who's about to snap it up.
Say what you want, but he's got an eye for real estate. Let me just give him a call and let him know he's gonna get the place.
Why don't we go through the profit-loss statement line by line from the past six quarters, which will offer us a good cost analysis comparison that I think we'll be able to utilize as we move forward - Aah! into the next fiscal year.
It's probably nothing, but there's a stain on the rug in the shape of a little kid.
I don't know if you want this now, but I bought you a mini cactus.
You can drink from these and then put 'em on your head to be a clown from an Italian opera.
Look, i-if you're not happy with your current property, we could roll your money over into something in Sinkhole Estates.
You know, when you were poor, you were always a douche, but at least you came by it honestly.
And you're the only guy in town who's ever called me out on my crap.
You know, I used to hate you for it, but... now I think you're the only person who was trying to be my friend.
Even though I know you never liked me, you still helped me when I really needed it.
First of all, I didn't have any clean underwear this morning, so I had to wear a bathing suit.
Then I missed the bus, of course. Then it looked like it was gonna start to rain. Luckily, it didn't.
She had a stroke that killed the part of her brain that says Jack Robinson.
All right, Brian, first order of business-- we have to decide who gets to ride in the cart and who has to push it.
We've been to every grocery store in town with no luck. are these little packets of weird vitamins that vaguely suggest they help you in the bedroom. Performance and stamina, for men.
I know. And now we're so far from home, none of your stations even work.
Well, the fat man's never going to get back in time, and with him gone, that makes you the man of the house.
I'm just saying, without Peter here, you're going to have to be the host of Thanksgiving.
You mean, like, fall asleep on the toilet and have a big red ring on my bum for a week?
No, at this hospital we obtain the sample using beloved British comic strip roustabout Andy Capp.
Oh, that is the nicest thing anyone's done for me since my kids gave me that Father's Day gift.
Nickelodeon-- casually ask your daughter what that girl's name is, then take your laptop into the bathroom.
Yeah, but can we just talk for a second about how brave I was when we walked past that cemetery?
You drove my car into a lake, you almost let me drown, you got us thrown off a bus, you broke our bike, and now you've gotten our turkey stolen and Thanksgiving is ruined and we don't have any transportation and we're still miles from home!
Well, if I'm so stupid, then how did I manage to frame you for eating the turkey?
I just posed you like that because I didn't want to take all the blame.
I can throw you off a bridge, and as long as I don't hit a person on a boat, it's okay.
Too bad, because your recently divorced mom has a crush on her trainer, and he eats like this, so now you have to, too.
Almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves-- just like PB and J, but with more of your mom railing this guy.
We stopped being a team when you framed me for eating that turkey with you.
Brian, maybe you should be a little less mad at me and a little more mad at the guys growing mustaches for this month.
And I hope it's not awkward that she's a little person and they viciously fight all the time.
As the oldest guy here, it's my duty to take an open mouth nap in the middle of the room.
I thought we could all take turns telling a long story about how things aren't the way they used to be.
You go to the ballpark, get your bag of Bulls-eyes and watch Hack Wilson round the bases in a big wool shirt.
Hey, buddy, you want to come to my house so my wife can cook you wrong?
But, hey, we cut the legs off him and dye him brown, we got ourselves a turkey, right?
Up on the right are the people with the awesome trampoline, but they don't let me on it no more,
Now, I wasn't planning on doing this today, but when I look around at all of these open, loving faces or friends and family,
I wish you didn't have to die, but a bunch of white people put on sweaters.
I know you wanted the perfect Thanksgiving, and I know I screwed that all up for you, but when you think about it, isn't this holiday about being with people you love?
You can always tell which fathers are disappointed in their sons because they eat lunch with their coats still on.
Yeah, you got anything for a poor fat person who wants to look like a rich fat person?
Now, I'll mostly be hitting on waitresses who are too young and thin to ever be interested in me.
And although I will never get over the pain of what you did to my son, I forgive you, because I believe you are sick and in need of help.
Hey, you want me to pick anything up on the way over or no, you're good?
Yeah, I know it's nothing fancy, but, you know, I'm not really into material possessions.
And besides, my dad always spends Christmas at his time-share in Coral Gables with his girlfriend.
You guys, I don't care what we do for my birthday, as long as it lasts the whole week and is very expensive and inconvenient for all my friends.
Oh, and I'm gonna dress like a slut and be rude to everyone for no reason.
I don't care that your dad's dying, we're all going to Montreal for the week.
Well, in high school, my best friend was this hot prostitute, and I just kind of got into the friend zone.
Just some random slut to maul in a bar back where the payphones used to be.
All right, Jesus, these speed date nights are the best way to meet a lot of chicks fast.
A-Are you okay with someone who wanders the desert, lecturing people on how to act?
I think it's time I had a little talk with him so he knows what a woman really wants.
Jesus, I asked you to lunch because I think you've been getting bad advice about finding a special someone.
Well, Peter's been doing his best, but lately he seems more focused on marketing his erotic Advent calendar.
You just have to be yourself and let a sweet girl see that side of you.
You're sensitive, you died for our sins and ascended into Heaven, and you got nice skin.
Don't be afraid to be honest with a girl and show her who you are.
I just tell folks to go down to the Happy Handy Smile Massage and get it over with.
Maybe we can both stop these Hollywood Jew writers from wrecking my marriage and your religion.
I just know Lois would make my first experience as special and memorable as it should be.
Clearly, there's been a lot of cheating on both sides, but the point is where do we go from here?
Well, I guess it is kind of an honor that out of all the people in the world,
You're an atheist, and the one guy you don't believe in is getting to bang the woman of your dreams.
Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie, he'd give me back the use of my legs?
Guys! I think I might've made a terrible mistake with this whole Lois and Jesus thing!
I always thought it was sort of a strange choice to let Jesus have relations with your wife.
Yeah, Jesus did the same thing to my wife Christmas before last and my buddy's wife the year before that.
Nah, he just acts lonely and lies about being a virgin so he can get with guys' wives.
But I seen our Lord and Savior bring a lady in there for a Christmas rodgering, I did.
He put actual strawberries in a glass of champagne, which was about the classiest, sexiest thing I'd ever seen.
Oh, you know, uh... that, uh, this holiest of days is about, uh, appreciating... our loved ones and, uh, resisting... temptation.
You are watching Amazon Prime, the network that brought you your sunscreen in two days.
Bet it's from a girl in the lunchroom who wants a taste of corn dog.
I guess your father and I will have to talk to the principal and figure out how to handle this.
Chris seems to be struggling in his classes, and often when kids have trouble in school, it's because something is going on at home.
I-I always knew Chris wasn't a great student, but I had no idea the situation was so dire.
All right, I'm gonna need three coffins-- mahogany with brass handles-- three new daddies for the dead astronauts' kids, and a black suit for me.
Sam Cooke didn't know much about history, and he got shot in a hotel wearing nothing but a sports coat and a shoe.
All right, we'll just tell Chris he's dreaming, because I don't want him to know about my time machine.
We're gonna take you on a special dream trip to help you pass your history test.
All right, I've got the return pad, and the time machine is powering up right now.
Oh, hey, come on, guys. Who built what is not a question on the history final, right?
All right, Chris, I reviewed your textbook, and I've programmed a tour of the various historical events that you'll need to know for your exam.
This bar is where famous American writers, like Ernest Hemingway, would go for a drink.
I mean, God, if only we could get rid of these damn arms and attach the pen directly to the heart, right?
Hey, Family Guy, you're lucky I got a manicotti in the oven, or I'd bash your face into a bolognese.
Did you ever consider-- the reason you're having trouble passing ninth grade is that you're incapable of anything else?!
Come on, Stewie, we got to find Chris and the return pad before it's too late.
I'll go search in first class, you go down to steerage and wade through the gross Irish and Italians.
Also, I gave the string quartet the sheet music for Highway to the Danger Zone.
I did-- he wasn't in the Turkish bath, the veranda café or the Bloody Handkerchief Ball.
I'm gonna go ahead and bet he's the guy with the whole chicken stuck on his head.
Besides, saving this ship would mean talking to, like, 80 people, and I-I'm just not in that kind of mood right now.
Look, Chris, just give us that thing you took so we can all get home.
And the parts I need to fix the return pad certainly aren't on this ship.
I am Lady Antonia Tyler Carrington, the Duchess of Lancashire, the heir to the Earl of Portsmouth, and the cousin of the Countess of Wessex.
Hey, here's a reminder-- as you exit the boat, don't forget to give us your extra snacks because as you know, we work for peanuts!
Um, what if one of us were to turn this big ship into a tug boat?
I'm not someone who often makes mistakes, but, well, I was wrong earlier when I called you a moron.
Look, you may not be book smart or history smart, but you're throw people off the boat smart.
I just hope that Chris killing one extra man on the Titanic didn't alter anything in the present.
Hallmark Original Pictures presents an instant family classic: Summers With My Slow Brother, starring a cast of people who make you say Oh, because you didn't think they were still acting.
Remember what happened the last time I had to choose between you and the TV.
I haven't been doing well on these practice tests, and I need to improve my score to get into a good college.
The SATs are this weekend, and there's no way I'm gonna get a good score.
You know, Meg, maybe you should get someone super smart to take it for you.
I'm just saying, find someone really smart to take the SAT for you in exchange for money.
Listen, is there any chance you'd be willing to take the SAT for me this weekend?
I don't know what you've been doing to this thing, Neil, but you see this gunk?
All right, I'm gonna go eat a sandwich with one hand and fill out the invoice with the other.
There's got to be someone else who'd be willing to take that test for you.
Uh, Mr. Jordan, you're gonna have to take your seat and stop asking people about their underwear.
That's the acronym I use for Faster Than the Speed of Love, because I mention it so much.
Anyway, I was just rereading my favorite passage the other day. The weight of the gun in Jason's hand surprised him.
But a wise book once said, With the heart at stake, right and wrong is a stake through the heart.
I've got a whistle, a cloth helmet, a key to a call box, a soft rubber truncheon, and a map of the city. Please hurry!
I was afraid I'd stick out, like the one guy in Lincoln's cabinet who didn't have a beard.
All right, cell phones away, eyes on your own paper, and before we start, who's giving me a ride home?
You don't got to worry about nothing, you don't got to read books, and you never die.
By the way, a huge part of being an idiot is constantly accusing people of thinking they're better than you.
Hey, yo, Stew. My boy Peter and I are watching the Sandler movie That's My Boy.
No, I mean it. How could one bad test score transform you into a complete moron?
Well, keeping in mind the recent behavioral changes you've described, I did a CAT scan...
There's only one thing to do: shrink down to microscopic size, enter Brian's brain, and destroy the tumor from within.
So, Doc, w... um, how much Jamba Juice do I have to drink to cure this? Um...
Dr. Hartman, do you think the brain tumor might explain why Brian's been acting so odd lately?
Hmm, well, I haven't heard of brains being linked to behavior, but I suppose anything is possible.
Well, since Brian's tumor poses no immediate threat, we can schedule surgery to remove it, and he'll be back to his old self in no time.
Well, I say we get that tumor out of him right away before he gets any dumber. No way.
My point is, Brian could have the surgery and be smart again, or he could skip the surgery and stay dumb like this.
Hey, um, I was told there would be a lollipop at the end of this?
This is the opera. I'm hoping that re-exposing you to high culture will remind you of the joys of a refined mind.
And after we get done with this, you're going to talk a lot about being present and grounded.
We're here to have a nice civilized dinner and to show you that you don't have to eat all your meals in your car.
Hey, cram it, skinny. Give me free food or I'm gonna tell people on Yelp there was a pube in my salad.
Write something bad. It was the last day of summer and the first day of the rest of her life.
Hey, Brian, I started the car in the garage and it's all foggy in there.
Hey, Brian, you want to go see Dr. Hartman and get that procedure where you get two wieners?
That way, when I watch Black Swan, I can aim one at Natalie Portman and aim the other at...
I-I feel like the main character of As I Lay Dying as he or she lay dying.
I mean, I was having fun, making new friends, getting laid all the time, sleeping like a rock, but you made the call.
You unilaterally decided I was better off a bitter alcoholic failure who can only hang out with a baby.
Big moment? Come on, Lois, he's moving from the green room to the purple room.
And just last month, we had to come here when he went into the green room from the yellow room.
Wow, look at that! This must be how the Tin Man felt when he finally got his heart.
And as for you, Tin Man, a 19-year-old kid in Cincinnati was struck by a drunk driver last night.
You know, it's kind of hitting me now that maybe I was thinking more metaphorically.
Which means there's a father of three in Nebraska who now has a very little chance of receiving one within the next 24 hours.
Now, who wanted the brain? And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
You just happen to be the offspring of a generation that celebrates their kids for nothing.
Actually, I met a photographer at Stewie's school yesterday, and he wants me to model for him.
I believe they're defective. Oh, my God, Peter, did you just rip your own ears off?
You know, Brian, I gave some thought to what you said the other day, and I realized you're right.
I asked Peter to read my manuscript, and he said he had to take you to dialysis.
I've spent my entire life in that ivory tower, learning from pop-up books and animal sound machines, instead of actually experiencing the world.
I'm gonna take a year off, hit the open road and live life to the fullest.
All right, I have $50 for the first person with a paper clip and rouge in their purse.
All right, Meg, while we take these, we can either play Freeze Frame or She Works Hard for the Money.
Well, Meg, the thing is-- my name's Evan, by the way-- a lot of people will pay good money for pictures of sexy feet.
I want to put 'em both in my mouth and then make a slapping sound on my bald head with 'em.
Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.
Now, tell us fast about your nonsense, so I can plow your mother on the staircase.
Did they take a picture of you eating a whole pizza pie next to an astonished chef?
Grab a pair of dirty socks and meet me by the tub of dead mice.
I've been thinking about this, and I'm not sure being a foot-fetish model is for me.
Sometimes people just need a little encouragement to succeed, like Jason Biggs got from his grandfather.
I'm tired of living my life in a tiny little box, like some sort of claustrophobic turtle.
Okay, Brian, the key to these things is to find a good position to sit on the ground.
Bring it, use it once, then put it back in the trunk for the rest of your life.
Uh, I don't know. Four different bands said we've been a great crowd, so you tell me.
Well, I'll tell you this, she's got to be the second most amazing girl here, because I've met the most amazing girl.
Meg, we know you've been doing foot porn, and that is going to stop right now.
Are you kidding? All you've done is make fun of anybody possibly thinking I could be a model.
We got to find out where that party is and get Meg out of there!
Just mash Brian's pill in there and smear it on the grass, he's good to go.
Now, Stewie, would you like your food served to you as an airplane or a magic bus?
We told you to take a dive in the third round, and you just kept popping back up.
I'm sorry your life was so screwed up that you almost had a three-way with a dog and a baby, but your life was not without meaning.
I left the comfort of the classroom to experience a world beyond books, and thanks to you, I did.
Also, I loaned you $40 for that Lumineers T-shirt, and you said you'd pay me back, so I'm gonna take your bra.
We're protecting our little girl from a lot of guys who I oddly recognize from Best Buy.
Well, Brian, thanks for going on that little adventure with me, but I think I've learned quite enough from the real world for now.
Yes, I was wondering, where is the room where I can roll around nude with my money?
How about Justin takes his shirt off, and we can get some photos of you on Justin's belly?
It was tough, 'cause I had to move all my O.A.R. stuff to fit the Guster stuff.
I like to have it on my person at all times, in case I need a quick inspo sesh.
It's like the rest of the world just shuts off, and all that matters is you and Lady Blue.
We've got all the awesome evidence we need. Hello, my name is Glenn Quagmire. I am a neighbor of yours on Spooner Street.
It turns out that girl I took home from Peter's party last night is in high school.
Well, in retrospect, she did ask a lot of questions about To Kill a Mockingbird.
My only hope for leniency is to bring in character witnesses and show the court I'm not the monster they say I am.
And as we know, according to Game of Thrones, if the girl has had her blood, she is good to go.
Mr. Griffin, do you have any evidence that is not based on film or television?
Well, it's when you urinate in a condom, and tie it off, freeze it, and then the woman, um, pretends it's a man.
The only way I learned my ABC's was by learning the names of all the guys my mom slept with.
How about I plow her in the limo and have her home in 20 minutes?
All I'm asking is that you give me the break that my childhood never did.
Your Honor, I have renounced my sinful past, and have been washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I have seen the righteous path of our Savior, and ask that you not sentence my son to jail, but instead release him to my custody so that I, with God's guidance, can rehabilitate him.
I know this is a hard time for you, but you need to seek forgiveness.
Oh, he's gonna be kneeling in front of a lot of guys, but I doubt he'll catch their names.
And maybe through our shared relationship with the Lord, we can begin to build a bond as mother and son. Mother and son?!
No, no, Peter, it-- and I cannot stress this enough-- it is not a throwing watch.
Hmm. I can't help but think this selfish attitude is part of what got you here.
I'll just have four to five beers to stop the shaking, and then I'll go outside.
You couldn't have been here for three hours on this, the hottest day of the year, or the ice cubes in your pitcher would have melted.
Boy, when you find a baby's tricycle, it feels like there's nothing you can't do.
You go home and tell your mother she's supposed to be a parent, not a friend.
This milk crate will be my chair, this overturned rain barrel will be my desk, and this DNA evidence centrifuge and fingerprint scanner will be my coatrack.
They're gonna think we're a bunch of old, bald geezers. Big Hairy Dicks for Kids.
So, you say this gumball machine took your dime and didn't give you a gumball?
But I'm telling you, it's gonna be a bigger waste of time than writing tough-guy dialogue for a Jet Li movie.
Just a weird life-sized lady doll made out of all the stuff that got stolen.
Maybe it's our fault Chris has such a screwed-up idea about what a relationship is.
Oh, boy, is this 'cause of the time I pushed off of you after sex and bruised your boob?
No, I-I mean, when was the last time you bought me flowers, or-or we had a date night?
Just last week, I let you watch me complain after eating too many hot wings.
Um, she doesn't think it's healthy for you to be spending all your time with a homemade sex doll.
And look, if you really want to learn how to bang that thing, there's no better teacher than your old dad.
After all, I'm the guy who taught old Asian people how to get on the subway.
So we're gonna go inside and get some sexy shots of you doing fireman stuff.
The truth is, I don't care if we never take it to the next level, physically.
I'm gonna have to write to somebody about this. Dear Penthouse, I used to think these letters were fake until my taped-together, soccer-ball-headed girlfriend fell in my lap.
I think Heather will be eating breakfast standing up this morning, if you know what I mean.
He slept with it, and now he'll slowly grow to hate it over the next 20 years.
She's perfect, because she's only sort of hot, so there won't be this crazy disconnect of her face on your body, which would totally take me out of it.
Oh. Well, tomorrow, Heather and I are going to the park to picnic and fly kites.
And on Saturday, she's hosting her book club, so I have to drop by, say something funny, and then stay upstairs.
Chris, when you go on your picnic tomorrow, c-can your father and I come with you?
I know. But I just want Peter to see what a thoughtful man looks like for one afternoon.
Yeah. Will you hold this beer bottle while I try to kick the top off it?
I don't know, but sometimes when life's got you down, you-you got to stand up for a second.
I took your doll because it's not a natural or healthy thing for a boy your age to have.
I was kind of jealous of it, so I guess I went a little crazy.
But I just want you to know, if you ever treat a real woman the way you treat that doll, you're gonna make her very happy.
Let's go to Whole Foods and buy a bunch of stuff from that weird aisle nobody else goes down.
Don't answer. It's just that Brian's been so distant lately, and we used to be inseparable-- like Jack and Jill.
Oh, so then Jack takes these two pails of water and trips and totally falls down the hill.
Jill had a tooth fall out, and she swallowed it, and then we had to root through her feces to find it.
And we did. And then we took it to the dentist, and he put it back in her mouth.
Some sad news this morning as 38 schoolchildren drowned when their-- excuse me-- when their school bus hit a patch of ice and drove off a loc-- what is wrong with me today?-- and drove off a local bridge.
All right, well, a U.S. convoy was ambushed in Kabul this morning, so now we're going to have a moment of silence in remembrance...
I thought, while we filmed, we'd just keep all of our stuff on your lap.
But I thought you and I could hang out and maybe watch Lois shush Peter while they watch Nashville.
Wait a minute-- Joe and Bonnie never used to spend time together until they had Susie.
I'm gonna lay it all out for Brian why we should have a baby together.
It'll just take a second. I-I normally wouldn't do this, but I was already kind of in the middle of something, and I just need to quickly respond, and there I am finiiished.
If we're going to fix this relationship, we need a baby and we need it now.
I'm just going to take a little bit of his DNA, and soon we'll be proud parents, like Ron Livingston's parents.
This will impregnate me with the child that will bring Brian and me back together!
First, I add Brian's hair and saliva, and some preschool applications, because we are already way behind.
There. Now I just have to get into the machine, and then the machine does whatever it has to do to me in order to successfully impregnate me.
Simple. I took your DNA and inserted it into my temporary uterus through my fertilization device.
People are gonna think I had sex with a male baby and then got him pregnant!
Stewie, you have to get rid of it. Get rid of it? You know, why don't you just say it?
Why not? Why am I always apologizing for how good-looking I am? I'm sick of it.
If you ever lay a finger on me again, I'll burn you in your bed.
I got a viral Internet video that's gonna go straight to the top of the charts.
Hi, I'm Joe Swanson, and this is 30 impressions in 30 seconds. Show me the money. Oh, behave. Good morning, Vietnam. Wait until they get a load of me, said the Joker.
I'm not really sure. Two days, six months... there's a certain amount of guesswork involved in this.
Oh, and while I'm pregnant, I'm going to need you to change the cat litter. We don't have a cat.
Now, before we begin, I want you to know the record is just past my watch.
Could you do that thing where you take some fluid and tell me if it's going to be an imbecile or a cretin?
How old are you? You look like you're 40, which means whatever you've got in there is 100% brain-damaged.
Okay, now people really love that viral video of a monkey forcin' that sex act on a frog at the zoo.
It's a divorced woman who knows about lady parts and cheers you on. Let's go!
Well, maybe you should look at the part of me where there's a baby coming out!
Oh, I caught two of them trying to eat each other, so that's something we need to watch out for.
You know, I was actually thinking, this could be a chance for you to finally make things right.
That sucks. And I worked really hard on taking a picture of myself every day for a year and then setting the photos to an emotional song.
I just feel like once I get them on a schedule, everything will be fine.
I don't know why anyone would want to be a parent, especially to four children.
Hey! Are you a big, fat bastard who loves eating at Outback Steakhouse, but thinks the portions are too small?
And why don't you wash it down with 40 ounces of malt liquor and ranch dressing, you fat!
The best thing about going there is you get to fly over the Pacific Ocean.
Everyone knows that, pound for pound, the Atlantic is the best ocean. Pound for pound?
Just a little something I learned volunteering as a youth counselor down at my church.
I mean, it's not like you've found a job since you moved back here anyway.
That's how I can always tell which guys in the Wrangler Jeans commercials beat their wives.
I strive for these things, and I get them, but at the end of the day, I still don't feel fulfilled.
She didn't say good morning to me, so I put an orange dot on her boarding pass, which means they're going to search her anus.
You see, the whole thing we're going for here at the TSA is a sort of bored fascism.
The worst thing a passenger can do is approach your podium before you tell them to.
Well, I was doing the dishes for a while, but they were inexperienced, so I ended up having to rub one out.
Where in the hell did you get the idea that that's what I meant by doing the dishes?
Why would I talk to Cleveland? He's a therapist now, and he's really great at helping people with their problems.
You want me to tell your best friend my complaints about you so he can back you up.
All right, since you're a patient, we're gonna talk about you like you're not here.
Cleveland helped me see that our entire relationship has been you doing whatever you want and me cleaning up the mess.
Well, you put the wet clothes in the dryer, you close the door and you wait.
If it goes around 30 times in five minutes, you get to have a Diet Coke!
Well, I'm doing security at the roller rink if you want to come watch me. Sure!
He's got Lois making me help around the house and spend more time with her.
He said I've gotta be more open and receptive to what Bonnie wants to do in the bedroom.
Or... remember when Cleveland wore briefs under his boxers and we found out and he told us not to say anything?
And you gotta tell her you were wrong and put things back the way they were.
Look, if you don't change what you're saying, we're gonna tell Donna you slept with that stripper at your bachelor party.
We now return to Major League Baseball with one distractingly ugly guy behind home plate.
It's two to two in the bottom of the sixth, and I just can't get my eyes off that man with the tall head.
Yup. And the longer I watch him, the more I wonder if he's there by himself.
Cleveland didn't show up to my therapy session earlier, and Donna says she hasn't seen him for two days.
Are there any steps leading to that alley or is it just a series of gentle ramps?
And since he eats, like, nine candy bars a day, if we wait here at the convenience store, he's bound to show up.
Yeah. I was thinking maybe our best bet is to just drive around town and see if we can spot him.
I-I thought we were gonna meet at the Tumi store and see who buys luggage at the airport.
Oh, my God! The ones we have a zillion of but are somehow never there when people need them?
And with people like you stealing tubs, how are we ever going to catch Abu Nazir?
Dammit, if only there was some kind of clue as to where he might be.
'Cause that'd mean I'd have to talk to Donna, and that's... that's just, like, ugh.
And, you know, even though therapy might not be your thing, you've got a job.
No, Meg. I'm your father, and I'm interested in what my daughter did this week.
But I-I feel like you're drawing this out, so when you do make fun of me, it'll hurt more.
Then by all means. I-- It's just upsetting when you thumb your nose at the family.
But I love you, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to say.
Okay, well, you two are clearly in love, but I could also go for some pudding.
I just remember CBS Outdoor Advertising on the bottom and three pigeons sitting on top.
Ordinarily I'd say no, but that adult kickball league is coming in for drinks, so let's get out of here.
Big talk for a guy who looks like a dad at a Dave Matthews' concert.
Peter, stay put. I'll call this in, and we'll get a crew out here to help you both down.
Now don't forget to water the plants every other day and change the cat's litter.
I wanted to see if a billboard had real pudding in it, so I climbed up there and came out a hero.
It's just like Gandhi always said, eat as much as you want and do whatever, and don't be afraid to hit each other.
Peter, that thing you said about not thinking and just doing stuff, did you mean that?
You know, not only did he quit his job, he's moved out and gotten his own apartment.
Maybe next time go straight to a medical professional and skip the horses and illiterate servants.
Well, that is the last time I drink and masturbate on top of a high wall.
I'm talking like this because I'm being very careful not to upset you, and for some reason this is the voice people use to do that.
I got to be honest, Joe, we came over here because we were worried about you, but these candies tell me you're doing great.
I mean, I ain't seen anyone this happy since the invention of the penny-farthing bicycle.
I expressly said no rakes allowed on the street when I am riding my futuristic machine.
I love being super pumped for 15 minutes and then bored out of my mind for eight hours.
It's great to just stand there and let Mother Nature spray it all over your face.
I want to kiss that cow, but I don't want it to be my idea.
I stopped listening to him back at the drive-thru when he leaned out the window and ordered a fur burger.
Well, not for nothing, but you could've taken us all to Disney World and shot yourself in the room.
Look, you guys, what we really need to do is bring him back to Quahog where we can get him some help.
Yeah. Yeah, you know, seeing the natural beauty of this place is actually making me feel much better.
You know, I spent the whole time trying to kill myself, but it took seeing you guys almost die to realize that life really is worth living.
All right, okay, don't anyone sing anything else until we get home. We got to record this.
I hired some guys to come to the house on Tuesday and assault her, and I'll come in and save her, and she'll be so grateful, she'll have to take me back.
Well, we do have these pills that may correct the enzyme imbalance in your liver. Yeah, that one.
Now, you'll need to administer these pills, because no dog ever voluntarily takes a suppository.
I got to say, it feels kind of weird having someone join me for lunch.
Let's see. Smoked whitefish, herring in cream sauce, smoked sable-- that's a different kind of whitefish-- and for dessert, the only bad cookie in the world.
It's good. I know everyone back there, so they let me drink their corn water.
All right, Brian, it's time for you to take one of these pills from the vet.
Oh, yeah, right. Can we do what we normally do, where you roll it up in a piece of cheese like you're fooling me? Yeah, I guess, but then you're gonna have cheese in your ass.
Look, I know it sounds a little rough, but why don't we start with a gentle massage of the area and see how you feel?
I should probably watch that old episode of Lassie where Timmy has to give her a suppository.
So from now on, anytime you got to cut one, you pull your pants down and you do it through this fart hole.
As soon as Brian does it, I'm gonna be on the other side, and I'll stick the suppository in.
Well, thank you. Yes, it is my liver, and I don't want to take that pill.
You're damn right I did! And I'll do it again if you don't stay the hell away from my ass!
I don't know, dear. By the way, we're the couple who lives a few blocks away.
So, Peter, I assume if you're watching TV, that means you already did all my chores?
I scared off the mailman, threatened Quagmire's cat, and I even took your bath for you.
All right, I need you to buy a birthday present for my friend Jeff-- he likes the Packers and surfing.
First thing tomorrow, I'm taking Brian to obedience school so we can get him back under control.
I'm supposed to meet the R.A. for coffee later in the common room, but until then,
I'm just gonna walk around with my shower caddy and see what people wrote on their whiteboards.
Look, I'd love to stay and talk, Neil, but I have homework, and there was no toilet paper in the girls' bathroom.
Well, while you freshen up, maybe I could help you get a head start on that homework.
Wait, Neil, I thought you and I were gonna go find unlocked cars and pretend we're driving them.
All right, first of all, it seems like you have a lot of opinions about a lot of comedians.
My sitting with you at lunch was part of a carefully laid-out plan to get close to your sister.
It's actually the first time I've been on a date since I got the nickname Gutterball.
Forgive me for speaking out of turn, sir, but you sent me to that school to change me.
I don't own any cassettes, so I just have to play whatever's on the radio.
Look, Chris, I-I'm sorry I lied to you, but I'd still like to be friends, and I hope...
Hey, Lois, you noticed ever since Brian came back from obedience school that things have been weird?
Well, he just lets me order him around, and he-he never wants to do fun stuff together like before.
I mean, the thing I always loved about Brian was that he wasn't just a pet.
You mean like a slice of turkey, or like a short section of one musical recording that's been digitally repurposed to be part of a new song?
In honor of Sammy, on the bus ride over here, we all sat in the back.
Ladies and gentlemen and people who have wandered in from the Chinese wedding next door, welcome to the roast of Peter Griffin, with your roast master Glenn Quagmire.
Joe, I'd tell you to take your seat, but I'd be about 15 years too late.
You know, Peter's challenging the stereotype of Irish guys being fat, drunk and stupid by throwing a little gay in there, too.
But I got to say, the worst part of being Peter's friend is knowing that eventually you're gonna have to be the fat-ass's pallbearer.
But seriously, everyone, let's have a big round of applause for the real hero tonight: Peter's chair.
This just in... is what Peter had to say to his wife on their wedding night, so she knew it was actually happening.
Peter's so ugly, he couldn't get raped in our holding cell down at the station.
For those of you who don't know, we have a real serious problem with people getting raped in our holding cell down at the station.
Peter, you're loud, you can't hold down a job, and you got high blood pressure.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, now that we've had our fun, it's time to give our man of the hour a chance to have his say.
Yeah, but I thought they'd stick to material about how I'm too handsome to work at a brewery, or-or how I have tiny little baby sneezes.
I just think you're a really cool island, and I'd like to get to know...
Hey, it's cool you got the keys to the school, and we can hang out when no one else is here.
Yeah, but I'm talking about the kind of friend that doesn't bark at horses when I'm watching a movie.
All right, I'm gonna go get some more coffee and maybe a gross microwaved sandwich.
We were just debating if Jamie should hook up with this guy she met a few nights ago.
Wow, you know, I know I just met you guys, but I've kind of been looking for a new group of friends.
Ugh, yeah, but don't talk to me about anything until I've had my morning coffee,
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd love to have you in our group of girlfriends.
Hey, isn't it funny that you guys came over for a dinner party, and all we're doing is standing in the kitchen, drinking wine?
Yeah, and then I realized I'm not good at making fettuccine Alfredo, but I am good at making reservations.
Karen's the one with the mommy blog, so if you think you know her from somewhere, that's where.
Lois tried to give CPR to a kid at a wedding once, and when she knelt down, she accidentally high-heeled her own stink hole.
You should be defending her, not talking trash and gossiping behind her back like some kind of Midwestern teenager.
She let Alan Ackerman smack her in the back with his tallywhacker behind the snack shack.
Look, the thing is, me and my new girlfriends, we've kind of been talking trash about you and laughing behind your back.
Well, I'm not thrilled, but I understand what it's like to be friends with women.
I guarantee you that as soon as you leave the room, they tear you to shreds.
Next time there's a sandwich in the fridge with somebody's name on it, don't eat it, scumbag!
Um, I'm maybe gonna go use the restroom and let you guys talk about whatever you're gonna talk about.
Hey, man, just a heads-up: instead of howling at the moon tonight, we're all gonna yell cock-a-doodle-doo!
I'd been mulling over for years, and when Family Guy gave me the opportunity to shoot it,
I knew there was only one actor who could portray Phil the Wolf: Glenn Quagmire.
I don't even remember, there was such a long cutaway, but I know it was really mean.
I don't... I've been... I've been watching this the same exact amount of time you have, Lois.
The whole family's dream is that she gets a spot on the U.S. Olympic Team.
Because men might punch you in the gut and call you a fat idiot, but at least they do it to your face and own it.
Hey, guys. I got something for you, an invitation for each of you to Quagfest.
Quagfest? What's that? You and a guest are cordially invited to witness Glenn Quagmire's at Quagfest, a three-day festival celebrating the three F's: food, fun, and...
It's gonna be like a block party but with way more weirdos grinding up against your wives.
There hasn't been that kind of excitement on our street since we had that big Dumpster in our front yard.
His new project is reportedly an historical epic, in which Mr. Neeson stars as a vengeance-crazed Albert Einstein.
Channel Five News has this exclusive first look that I taped off my VCR from Entertainment Tonight.
Yeah, every time you get a couple of beers in you, we have to hear all about how you can beat up Liam Neeson.
Hey, you know this old woman who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn't know what to do?
I noticed that you're one of the moms who hasn't yet signed up to be a classroom volunteer.
Oh, I-I just assumed after that incident in the parking lot with that bitch in the Lexus, you wouldn't want me to.
I don't bother you when you're sitting on the washing machine, screaming Aaron Eckhart's name.
Aw, did you spill juice on yourself, sweetheart? Sweetheart? Slow your roll there, Cougar Town.
Yeah, except I got molested in the House of Mirrors by either one man or 100 identical men.
I mean, we just had a great day of fun and rides and finger-sniffing, and all you can talk about is fighting some guy you've never even met!
To meet Loretta at a McDonald's parking lot to pick up my son, Cleveland, Jr.
I'm sorry. Can we do a happy yell again to get the taste out of my mouth? All right!
We just got to get you on that set, so you can kick his ass.
Hello, sir. We're here to see Liam Neeson, the guy who wears the same long jacket in all his movies.
Peter, you're never gonna get close enough to Liam Neeson to throw a punch at the guy.
That's why I'm dressing up as the one woman no Irishman can resist: Mrs. Potato Head.
Okay, guys, there's no better way to draw out an Irishman than setting up a confession booth.
The best way to kill wolves is to kill their leader, wear his skin, kiss some of the wolves, then kill them.
Miss Tammy's in her car yelling at her boyfriend on the phone again, so it looks like I'm doing lunch.
Okay, Landon, time to sabotage you with the most dangerous thing in the world for a toddler: a whole, uncut grape.
Mom, Dad, I've done a lot of thinking, and I've decided I don't want to go into the family business.
How much disease could a woodchuck doctor cure if a woodchuck doctor could cure disease?
Next time, if you have an idea, run it through the test before you embarrass yourself.
That's right. I hear you've been all over town saying you could kick my arse.
Stay tuned for the thrilling conclusion of this story, and the just-regular conclusion of the other story.
But one slip-up, and you'll be deader than the first man to die in the Battle of the Boyne.
All right, Landon, let's see how you like it when someone moves in on your territory.
Um, first, I've been summoned to be a potential juror, but I don't want to go, so I need you to report in my name.
Um, I would try to be fair, but, uh, I am on record, you know, very famously, as having released a kraken.
I want you to take over my Twitter feed and tweet back to my fans.
Peter, I was at an outdoor mall today, and there was a kiosk selling little remote control cars.
It was very funny and enjoyable, so what I need you to do is to go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
Go to the gym, kneel down in the shower, and ask strange men to pee in your cupped hands.
Oh, Bonnie won't let me spend any more money on Peter because he's not very nice to me.
And besides, my week as a helper mommy is done now, so when you come home today, you'll have me all to yourself.
I acted like such a big man, and I didn't want to admit I was a coward.
Now, Peter, I'm out of crackers, and I'm gluten-free, so what I need you to do is go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
No, we all just booked a vacation together to a private resort in the Bahamas.
Well, that's a lot of my money, but I used to have sex with you, so that's the trade-off.
Yeah, it'll be awesome to nail a hotel masseuse and then watch Nanny McPhee in the room.
Yes, very. He even bought some sort of language tapes, although I don't think he's using them properly.
Oh, she wanted to be here, but she got hired to be the stuffy old woman who slowly comes around to it in a rap video.
All right, I know most of you haven't traveled with me, but get ready to see a lot of airport elevators you didn't know existed.
Hey, guys. Say, Lois, I-I know you said this trip was couples only, but great news.
This is Kimmie. I met her in a pop-up window on the Internet. She was in my area.
All right, well, I suppose I could look into adding you two to the reservation.
Geez, I haven't seen you this excited since you got that letter sent by carrier owl.
Sorry, I'm being told this would be very expensive to animate, so instead, here's some stock footage of an old plane trying to take off.
We have a special beach barbecue planned for you tonight, but in the meantime, please enjoy all our amenities.
We will. Come on, girls, let's go wear big floppy sun hats in the pool and then be mad when they get wet.
Damn it, I tried two things that all kids love: coffee and old seed packets.
And all any of you can do is stare at those Game Boy machines! I'm sick of it!
I'm gonna show you kids how to have fun the old-fashioned way, like I did when I was a kid.
I thought we could go down to the old swimmin' hole and swim in a hole.
All right, our first counseling exercise will be speaking to each other with I feel statements.
Okay, last night I did some personality assessments based on yesterday's session, and what I found was none of you couples are compatible with each other at all.
Well, back when I was your age, there was nothing better than knocking on doors and throwing paper bags full of flour at people.
It's the best thing! We used it to keep Italians from going to the polls.
Hey, Kimmie, I'll pay you a thousand dollars for one whole handful of your butt.
Do you think me throwing full sodas into the garbage had anything to do with this?
Oh, boy, I haven't had this much fun since I played with that Bublé wrap.
Lois, when we got captured, I said, You rebel scum, and Kimmie didn't get it.
Stuffing your slob faces, taking video you'll never watch, and asking if I'm the Captain Phillips guy.
Yes, sorry to deceive you all, but we find that when couples don't respond to traditional counseling, the stress of extreme danger reminds them of what matters most in their lives-- their love for each other.
All right, Lois, let's just leave our bags here and wonder where our clothes are for the next two days.
Yes, he's been a little difficult to deal with, and on page two of three in the How To Be a Teacher manual, it says that any child who's being difficult should be medicated.
Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me when I was telling you about Kevin trying to hang himself with an extension cord.
Ah, yes. So you're telling me your baby won't sit still in a way that's convenient for his teacher?
Well, as a young man, I found that a great meal was the quickest way to a woman's heart.
The old one burned off his eyebrows, and was just too weird to look at.
Well, the school said he had an attention problem, so Dr. Hartman gave him a prescription.
Cedar plank salmon with a maple glaze and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes on a bed of mesclun greens.
Now, the ingredients of a mince pie are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought back
I had house-sat for her Aah! while she was visiting her aunt in Vernon Oh, God. and she wanted to thank me.
Instead of embracing their mental gifts, their first reaction is to shoot them up with hard-core drugs until they're mindless sheeple.
All the better to send off to Kuwait and feed the Halliburton oil machine, right?!
Yeah. And college kids take it all the time so they can focus on their studies and drinking alcohol with their butts.
Okay, well, Stewie, these babies can help the garbage disposal focus because that's where they're going.
And as I'm walking you through the steps, watch your screen for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips: helpful hints and food factoids to make your meal a success.
And in that bag, we'll combine one large, finely-chopped garlic clove; one tablespoon of grated, peeled fresh ginger; two teaspoons of five-spice powder; a teaspoon of salt; and a half teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.
Then you're gonna want to add the duck breasts, seal the bag, and refrigerate that for at least one hour, or up to 24 hours, if you want to prepare this ahead of time.
Listen, I saw what happened, but you should know, we at the station would hate to lose you.
I'm not asking you to. In fact, we'd like to offer you your own cooking show.
Well, Peter, since the DUIs happened so close together, we don't really have much wiggle room here.
And I just figured, the hell with it, why not build a scale model and record voices for all the characters? Watch.
Oh, really? Then why do I already have a restaurant in Orlando's largest indoor water park?
Okay, Joe, Peter and I are going head-to-head in that cooking competition, and they're letting us each use an assistant.
There's a book fair at the convention center, and George R. R. Martin will be there.
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker, and we have a fantastic cooking competition for you today with two fantastic chefs.
God, he must be the coolest fat guy in a train conductor's cap in the world!
Mr. Martin, I'm Brian Griffin, and I've got a pitch that's gonna blow you away.
You just took a lot of pills, mashed together a bunch of sci-fi and fantasy clichés and crapped out a 2,000-page turd.
Oh, sure. But that stuff doesn't make you write well, it just makes you write a lot.
Yesterday, I watched Chris shower for half an hour just because I thought it was the TV.
Joe, grab my recipe book and find a dish where I can substitute olive oil with butter.
Well, that's it. If Chef Quagmire has prepared a dish of any kind, he wins this competition.
A warm packet of tartar sauce brought in from somewhere else. When are you gonna use that? Bonnie said.
I've met Cleveland's dad, and my dog slept with Quagmire's dad, but I don't know anything about your dad.
Yeah, is he still with us, or is he living in Heaven with Jesus Christ?
My dad's a stinking drunk who lives in Ireland, but you got a perfectly good dad.
He should be with his dad on Father's Day, and we're gonna track him down.
Oh, and now that I'm inside the barrel, he gave you and your sister HPV.
It's Dasher, he's been complaining, and he is the one who has to look at it all night.
I found Joe's dad on the Internet, and he just e-mailed me to say he's coming tomorrow.
Well, I got the results of your ultrasound, and I got some news for you.
Just get him one of them Father's Day cards what plays a song. Dad to the Bone. I'm Dad.
No, it's just that ever since I was a little kid, he was constantly making fun of handicapped people.
Wow, then it must have been hard for him to accept when you were paralyzed.
You guys got to get in touch with him and tell him not to come.
I know you're trying to be rude, but I am gonna do that, because I find it enjoyable.
Sorry, I've made a decision to go for that shirt, and when that happens, it is on.
Let me ask you, doesn't it bother you being an adult man who's that short?
You spend the day with me, you'll see how great it is to be short.
I put this pair of pants on the front legs of this horse and strapped Joe to the front with his legs tied behind the horse's neck.
And then we put Cinnamon's head up the back of Joe's shirt and simply hid the rest of the horse behind this curtain.
And to induce movement, I'm gonna snap the horse's balls with this dampened kitchen towel.
Let's see how long it takes them to get Gumby over there into the car.
We spent the whole day together, and he showed me there's a lot of advantages to being short.
Now, come on, Brian, I guess we should try to make it over to Meg's birthday party.
I just found out I'm actually going to be tall, so I'm no longer comfortable hanging out with someone whose teeth are bigger than their fingers.
Oh, and remember, Joe, if Lois is feeling frisky at night, it's index finger around and clockwise.
I'm thinking that I've had two dads and neither one cared for me as much as Bud does.
Nothing's stopping you from going over there and telling him the truth: that his son is a paraplegic who's stuck in a wheelchair.
If you think you're getting away from me, you've got a crazy laugh coming, friend.
I spend one afternoon with the guy, and it's like I signed an eight-year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child.
Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise has better things to do than follow you around.
You know, it's times like this where I think, if I didn't talk and you were a normal baby, we wouldn't have any of these problems.
He's creepier than that guy at the gym who just does karate in the mirror.
See, a guy like that should just stay inside so we don't have to look at him.
I guess I could never stand the thought of something like that happening to me.
Well, Dad, I can tell you from experience it's only when your worst fears come true that you get to find out how strong you really are.
Hey, Joe, uh, just one question: why do you have all those Wizard of Oz plates?
Well, that's about as much HBO as we're gonna get before they play something homosexual.
I've got 10,000 followers. I feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides.
Just keep reading. Hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look.
Just give me the phone. No, no. I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
Was it a re-run on basic cable, because sometimes they edit those a lot and that could be why you were confused?
Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie, but I-I think I'm gonna put together a real act for real people.
I'm almost done doing the 45 minutes of stuff a woman my age needs to do right before bed.
All right, fine, but I'm not gonna brush my teeth and I'm gonna fart super hot.
We act like we didn't take a lot from The Simpsons, but we took a lot from The Simpsons.
Because, uh, I have a slide of the Capitol building that I'd like projected behind me.
There was... there was supposed to be an upside-down picture of the Capitol behind me.
Hey, so, um... you know, maybe it's me, but I kind of feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides.
Yeah, and... and... and hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look.
Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there, but I want you to try it one more time, like this: Duh!
Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries before I go to sleep.
Well, it seems good, but I won't know for sure until I have my evening tug.
So I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long, until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad.
I am willing to take the old Nestea plunge, if you know what I mean.
When we're done, I'll grab you by the ankles and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag.
This mattress was expensive, and I'd like to keep it nice for a little while.
All right, Lyle, one thing buddies do together is go to the movies and talk about it afterwards.
Now I can do fun things like get on your shoulders and wear a trench coat and be tall enough to ride roller coasters.
I am clearly above the minimum height requirement and shall now ride your roller coaster, for which you are an attendant.
Yes, and I will operate this roller coaster, as I am an adult who is licensed to do so.
You get out of here, you kids who are just kids and not an adult like me!
As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in The Prophet, I am the bow from which the arrow of you was launched.
I moved the van over to the other gas pump, and the gas cap was still on the wrong side.
No, no, it's 'cause we got this new mattress, and Lois doesn't want to mess it up.
I hope you did your homework, because you're gonna spend a third of your life on that thing.
If Lois won't sleep with you on the new mattress, we just got to get your old mattress back.
Man, I haven't been this desperate to find something since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac.
Lyle, we finally got a thank you note from Bella for that birthday party present.
Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time for a friend of your simple ways.
Yeah, you got any brain-dead women in there you let people have sex with for a few bucks?
Well, Peter, I don't think you can go any farther down the ladder than porno people.
We did get another one yesterday, but some fat-ass blew out half the springs, so we put lunch on it.
You may not want me back as a friend, but you deserve better than those robots.
I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight after they see how many slaps it takes to give me a stutter.
Is this one of those theaters where they bring your beef stew right to your seat?
Hey, you know how we always dreamed about having a house that comes out of our butts?
It's just that when you've read as many books as I have, it-it takes a toll, you know?
He lowers the average lifespan of humans to 65, but there are many exceptions based on genetics and diet.
If we want to write a scary movie, we need to do it somewhere scary.
So far, this has been a bigger waste of time than an acceptance speech at the Asperger's Awards.
I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met, in the order that I met them, last name first, and if anyone interrupts me, I'll have to start over.
You know, I like them horror movies where you got a couple of teenagers getting busy in their car at Makeout Point, but there's a killer on the loose.
And besides, Richie, aren't you worried about what the man on the radio is saying right now?
Oh, what, you mean the big, rabid, slobbery cat what's been scratching people to death?
We should write one of them zombie movies where a guy wakes up in a comfortable cotton hospital gown with the back open so there's a nice breeze on your behind, and he's like, This ain't bad.
I-I don't know, I-I was thinking we'd write a movie where something that's not supposed to be scary becomes scary.
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa, are you enjoying that new soap I bought you from that mysterious Chinese man whose store was weirdly not there the next day?
Guys, do the words dead by dawn scrawled in feces over there mean we're in trouble?
Darling, I was running to the Empire State Building to see you, but I got hit by a car.
So just relax, take your glasses off, take a nice, dry sauna-- no glasses in the sauna-- just leave those puppies in the locker.
ANNOUNCER: This Family Guy joke was written by Jimmy Sullivan, age nine, of Decatur, Georgia.
Hey, hey, when you were a cop, when you were going to a crime scene, did you go chung Chung, like Law & Order?
Oh, hey, check it out, man, when you were a cop, did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs when you were getting kinky with your girl?
Oh, hey, by the way, a bunch of us are gonna kill you in the shower later.
Okay, I am really on edge and this thing we're doin', I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist's book.
I want to stay here and see what you're seeing, because you're saying things that I think are somethin' totally different than what they are.
Well, probably, but good luck with that whole you three and not me killed a guy thing.
But once you throw it in there, how you gonna get the dirt back on top?
Yeah, I guess writing a movie isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes it look.
Plus, you know, when people find that box, they won't know that, like, for some of them magazines,
Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's.
What if we break into my old house and steal back my big box of pornos?
I want the double cheeseburger, but I'm gonna go healthy and get the fish and chips.
You guys have been sitting in front of my house for the last five hours trying on Obama masks.
This guy used to live in your house and a box of his old porn is still hidden in there.
And I was gonna stay with the rental van because it's my name what's on the contract.
By the time you watch this, you'll be grown-up, so I'm sure you're allowed to eat ice cream and pizza for every meal. You know it.
Also, I bet you're a big important doctor like that Doogie Howser kid who's getting so much ass.
I just hope to God you're not stuck in some loser job, like in a brewery, or a toy factory, or a fishing boat. Oh, boy.
Right near the basket, underhanded, effeminate gasp, over the backboard, out of bounds, waddle over to get it, slip on a towel, twist my ankle, go to the emergency room, doctors tell me it's not that bad and I shouldn't have come there,
It's just a teenage loser who didn't realize he had no future in front of him.
I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure that you grow up to be a success.
I don't want him to end up like me-- dead-end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where fat's supposed to be, and fat where skinny's supposed to be.
Okay, now, Chris, if you want to be a success, you gotta look worldly and sophisticated.
And to do that, you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz, with little something from every part of he world pinned on you.
And nothing says, Look at me, I've been places like two lit road flares hanging from your sunglasses.
Well, I been trying to make Chris less of a fat dummy, and nothing seems to be working, so now we're high-stepping around in giant hats.
Peter, I have to ask-- are you pushing Chris so hard because it's what's best for him?
Or are you trying to make up or your own disappointment about how your life turned out?
Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available,
No, no, no, my point is that you need to let Chris find his own path.
Chris, your best chance for success is to be cultured and worldly, like our dog.
I mean, you went to Brown, you're a published author, you can hear it first when Joe falls out of the tub.
Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond out of this lump of coal.
Who knows? Maybe you'll even become one of those mission control leaders who gets all thoughtful while everybody's celebrating.
Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader a couple of years ago and I'm still pissed about it.
And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival and went to a Q and A to ask questions that weren't really questions.
That would've been fine for the old me, but Brian and I have to be going.
Yeah, we're off to see an old movie on temporary screen in a muddy, freezing park.
Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right.
Oh, Peter, I know you miss him, but this is what you wanted, isn't it?
Check it out, Lois-- when Chris notices that World's Greatest Son mug I made, he'll be back on board with his old man in no time.
All right, Chris, now I know you're all sophisticated now, but no man can resist the siren call of mentally impaired supermodel Kate Upton.
Well, I figure I can lure Chris in with this French movie-- Le Rocqué Trois.
You wanted Chris to be a better person with a bright future, and thanks to Brian, that's what he has now.
And of course, in Portnoy's Complaint you've got the guy who's living near the water...
That doesn't sound right. ...and he hated the noise from the local port, so he filed one of the very first port noise complaints in maritime law.
And for those of us who read the complaints, trust me, they were very warranted.
Whoa, Chris, now you're starting to sound like Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens.
I thought you were this worldly, sophisticated guy, but you're just a fraud-- like Moses.
And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment-- Moses gets to be first in line at the buffet.
Look, Chris, you're my kid, and I want what's best for you, but I guess I just don't want you to become too good for your old man.
And the mama panda doesn't do anything about it, because she was blinded to make her more submissive.
Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when talking to a coworker in the bathroom.
Plus, you know, when people find that box, they won't know that, like, for some of them magazines,
Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's.

Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when talking to a coworker in the bathroom.
Monster Energy Drink. What is it? I don't know, but it's free from this truck that stopped outside your work.
Ever bit the beak off a bird? Monster Energy: put it in your body and ask questions later.
Mr. Griffin has shown good faith in appearing here today and will not be subjected to this sort of hostile interrogation.
Wow, Peter. In all the years I've known you, you've never even mentioned a sister.
Besides, she says she's been having Thanksgiving with your mother for the last 20 years.
Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour before the turkey's done, but I made more appetizers.
What just happened was a national tragedy, but it's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Andrea the Giant!
We will never forget what happened yesterday, but you'll also never forget what's gonna happen September 17 at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena!
Yeah, I wasn't here, but I heard her scream, so I came flying in and found her like this.
It's weird. Same cause of death as those three guys in that local public bathroom.
And then, so I'm like, Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?
It's just past all the amazing colors of fall, and before the white of winter.
Look, I-I just want you to know, I feel bad about what happened with you and Aunt Karen the other day.
Oh, you mean when she put me in that no-bottom James Bond chair and assaulted my grundle?
Who would like me to read them a book, or maybe paint their name on a grain of rice?
And maybe if you finally do, she'll stop terrorizing you, and you won't have to take it out on me for the rest of my life.
When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy, the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.
So I arranged for you to get some combat pointers from my old buddy, Steven Seagal.
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat your sister in the ring, you got to get to the root of your fears.
I've wanted to do my whole life: put my sister in her place and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.
And we've got quite a match tonight between Heavy Flo and another woman whose name I've forgotten but I'm sure is a gross pun.
I tell you, this is one for the books, if anyone kept track of this nonsense!
You know, this was the fanciest restaurant in Quahog when I was a kid. The ladies' room has a big space with chairs in it, like a living room, before you get back to where the crappers are.
I'll be back with martinis for Mom and Dad, and for you kids, some martinis.
Sure. But don't forget the butter that looks like decorative bathroom soaps and is impossible to smear.
Oh, Peter, look. You can put your business card in this bowl and maybe win a free lunch.
I'll handle this. All right, here's what you're gonna do: skip the live music. Get yourself a room over at the Wickford Marina. Take her out on a balcony, point to any boat in the harbor, and tell her it's yours.
I call 'em rubbers. Or you could just pull the hose out of the bucket and let it spray free.
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick guy, it's my job to sit on a BMX bike outside the rec center and ask every kid if they're the new kid.
I got to go now. You sure you don't want to come over and pull on my cat's nipples?
Well, the most intimidating people are toothpick guys who work at seafood counters and make people uncomfortable for not knowing about fish.
Damn it! I'm gonna need you to put that large two-handed colander over the toilet.
Lois, we got to drive to Smitty's right now and get one. Now? But we told Chris we'd be there when he wakes up from surgery.
All right, we were able to fix your hernia, but you've got to stop lifting sewer hole covers.
All right, but we already ate dinner, so maybe just an iceberg wedge, a steak, and some sides.
Yeah, but we got to get going. Carter's our babysitter, and if he's with the kids too long, they start sayin' racisms.
You like to play the field, but, deep down, you really wish you had a woman like Lois, don't you?
Long time. And yet we've never discussed mothers' maiden names, the names of old pets, high school mascots, favorite teachers. Heck, I don't even know the last four digits of your Social.
By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage.
Yeah, and if you keep listenin', you can hear a Puerto Rican busboy get fired in the background.
Too big a deal?! The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife!
Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me.
You know what? I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl.
If you act on this, all you'll do is wreck your friendship and cause heartache for everyone involved.
Yeah. Ignore it. Like you do with the ghost of that colonial woman who died falling down our stairs.
How blessed are we to have all them Boyz II Men just floating around in the sky?
I wasn't sure what people like, so I got some with seeds on them and some without.
If he was just home busting one to his buddy's wife, hell, we've all done that.
Look, now that this is settled, maybe you and Glenn can put this behind you.
No way! How am I supposed to be friends with someone who's in love with my wife? Quagmire is dead to me and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.
Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter aren't gonna talk this out, you and I should.
See, this is where Quagmire normally would have told one of his outrageous sex stories.
So I'm bangin' this chick, and she's sayin' to me, I'm worried that Chris won't get into college.
And then I lost my wood, and so we just watched Colbert, and then I took a dump completely nude.
Look, Peter, I'm sorry Quagmire moved away, but you can't just sit around the house and drink all day.
I lost my best friend, my buddies are all fighting, that chick at work is saying stuff that ain't true.
And the truth is, we all have private thoughts we don't act on, and that's okay.
I don't totally disagree with what Kim Jong-un's doing, but you don't see me moving there.
Joe's a little worse than the rest of us, but we all just shove our thoughts deep down, where they can't hurt anybody.
The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise.
Are you a New England dirtbag who wants to run with bulls, but thinks Spain is gay?
You and your friends can run from a bunch live bulls, and lots of times, there's a chick whose boob comes out.
Sure. I'll wheel over to the bar and bring back your beers one by one in my lap.
I got hit by a car in high school, so I don't have to work.
We didn't want to tell you, but we're going to the Seriously Wicked Bull Run.
I think he's bitter because he never got the credit he deserved for killing Osama bin Laden.
As long as he thinks you're our new pet, we can keep fooling around behind his back.
Wow, this could be an even better scam than that claw machine at the arcade.
They have the type of fat white woman here that not even I am interested in.
Check this out-- the way he's sitting, it looks like the dog's watching the news.
Now, which wall would you like to look at for the rest of your life?
And you probably don't want any reminders of Bonnie around the house, so I cleared out all of her underwear.
Okay, I'm just gonna walk 30 feet away, and then panic because I can't see you.
In my day we'd throw him in the army and have him play the bugle.
It's a huge amount of work and we don't have any idea what we're doing.
Yeah, that's why I looked into it, and we've reserved a place for him at the State Home for Mentals and Bastards.
Hey, Joe, you know that movie you told me to watch that you said was your favorite movie of all time, and you said I had to watch it?
Would the French people let their boss walk around in stained underwear trying to stab people if the place wasn't nice?
That's why I'm gonna go stay with my mother in Baltimore and work at her wife's bar.
Well, you remember when the vet knocked you out to take out that rotten tooth?
Heh, I like how you're chained up in a yard and still trying to pretend you're a guy.
Her husband's a maniac and the only reason he hasn't killed me is because he thinks I'm just his pet dog.
Garcia steps off the mound again, virtually guaranteeing that my wife will be asleep when I get home.
The big right-hander kicks a little dirt and tosses the rosin bag as my children grow up without me.
Hey, I don't know if you can hear it, but I'm peeing in my coffee cup right now.
We may or may not have put Joe in a smelly home for the goofy.
Well, we figured you'd say no to us, but not to Vice President Joe Biden!
First, I want to thank you, Vic, for shooting the guy we said was Osama bin Laden.
Dr. Hartman must have dropped his phone in Joe when he was looking at his spine!
Yeah, it turns out Dr. Hartman's cell phone was pressing on my spinal cord, and that's what was causing my total paralysis.
Yeah, sorry we dropped the ball for a while, which is the way we agreed we'd describe what we did to you, which hopefully makes it seem less heinous.
Hey, great idea bringing the couch out here from your den, Peter. Yeah, Lois and I dragged it out here last night for a little hump sesh, so I figured I'd let it dry. Couch. That's one of those words that if you say it over and over it starts to sound silly.
Besides, you can't just go get a gun, you have to be certified in gun safety, go through an extensive background screening process.
All right. Uh... it's kind of too cool for the air-conditioner and too warm for the heater, huh?
There's some weird, big-nose guy hiding in the bushes outside some chick's house. My heart always timidly hides itself behind my mind. I set out to bring down stars from the sky... Ow. Ow. Oh, my God, four men are beating me. My arm. I think it is broken. Who are you guys? Why? Why? I'll give you anything if you would only stop hitting me. Please stop pulling my nose. It is not fake. I think I am dying.
For real. Come on! Let's fool around, or watch a movie, or finally click that Crackle icon on the TV.
It was dark. I-I... I don't know why he didn't just say it was him.
I went to turn it down, and the next thing I know. you shot me!
I was hoping to apologize and collect his deposit for the community watch shirts. I talked to him earlier.
Good evening. Two nights ago there was a shooting right here in our own backyard.
Now, Mr. Brown, I understand you're trying to get the police to reopen the investigation.
That's right, Tom. My family and I believe this shooting was a hate crime, and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin held accountable for his actions.
The cashier at the grocery store told her to push on, and then she snapped her fingers, and now I think she's my new favorite lady in the world.
Come on, let's play some ball. ...and then Peter and his new friends went for ice cream.
Lois, to show I'm in touch with what it's like to be African-American, I am gonna go to the middle of the town square, get naked and paint myself brown.
Cigars. We can smoke 'em together, all happy, like a bunch of douche bags outside a wedding.
I guess me getting transferred by the Xerox Corporation wasn't the worst thing after all.
No, Peter, I'm here to place you under arrest for the attempted murder of Cleveland Junior.
Well, guess I finally have time to learn to reset the clock on the coffee maker.
I'd like to talk to you about these charges that have been brought against you.
But the media's out there making you look like a monster, all for exercising your constitutional rights.
I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit back and let them do this to one of my own.
Look, I'm gonna bail you out of here, set you up with my lawyer, and get these charges dropped.
Not like when I read my JAG fan fiction at the NCIS convention. JAG stood up and yelled, 'Objection, Your Honor, by Navy law.' He then turned to the lady lawyer, the gal from the October Maxim, who still managed to be hot despite her sexless, pageboy haircut.
And I was trying to get back into my house, and my neighbor, Mr. Griffin, shot me.
He said he felt threatened by me, and that hurt even worse than getting shot!
I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.
Yeah, white paper. Check your jacket pocket. I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.
Check your other jacket pocket. Hey, look, I'm just saying it's no surprise that justice isn't colorblind.
Mr. Brown, you testified that you were listening to music at the time of the shooting.
And doesn't he have the lyrics, I put the gun to you. I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up, put ya inside the mattress like drug money?
Your Honor, I'd like to enter into evidence this photo of a badly beaten Rihanna as well as this print ad for the Entourage movie.
You might see, like, the very top of the crack, but that's-that's not what it's about.
I swear, it had nothing to do with the color of his skin, but... I did shoot him.
I'm saying that I, Cleveland Brown, a black man, shot Cleveland Brown, Jr., another black man.
Peter, since this is about racism, why don't we take a slow, hands-clasped-behind- the-back walk together?
His dad-mom sent over some boxes of men's clothes from back before the ol' chippety-choppety.
I'll be on the toilet, wearing a T-shirt that's so long I have to hold it under my chin while I wipe.
I saw an ad in the paper for guys over five-foot-four, and I was the only one who showed up.
Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?
All right, Friedrich, now that World War Two is over, we can get back to making comedies again.
All right, gang, me and the guys are off to Korea to find the last episode of a soap opera Quagmire was in.
But we should probably head out to find the last episode of that Korean soap opera.
Nobody here thinks you look good unless you have big, round eyes and a tiny little nose and chin.
I feel like I want to giggle behind my hand at a lot of things and hold, but not eat, a big ice cream cone.
I heard that American Johnny was back, so I started following you on the new Where American Johnny? app.
What is this, and how can I make the rest of my life about it?
Okay, I'm done with this sweet rice water that has a pine nut floating in it.
Find out after this Korean commercial Ashton Kutcher thought no one in America would ever see.
Have you ever killed a dog while driving drunk, and then been upset that there was no way for your car engine to cook it for you on the rest of the drive home?
Just put the dog in the bag, place it over the engine block, and drive your usual over the speed limit.
Plus, commercial pilots around here can just fly their plane into the ocean if they want.
It's a powerful thing when a woman pays you even the slightest bit of attention.
I know those New York Giants jerseys weren't cheap, but I'm staying here, and that's final.
I can get drunk whenever, sleep with anyone, and just hide in my house and avoid the world if I feel like it.
Let's sit down later and see if we can figure out a plan to get our finances in order.
Hey, Peter, I think I figured out one way we can save money for Stewie's college.
I shall be at the beach looking for valuables and occasionally using a doorless bathroom.
I gotta start eating breakfast at on-the-sand cafes, where I will judge tourists as my skin browns and hardens.
Yeah, some idiot buried, like, a hundred of 'em in this big lawn under these bone cages.
Maybe. Or it could be because of my I'm Gonna Barf on the White House blog.
Peter, did you rob a bunch of people on the beach with your metal detector?
All you're doing is getting into trouble and digging up junk when we really need to be saving for Stewie's college.
But you should know, the day I bought this metal detector was the happiest day of my life.
We saw an ad looking for a toddler to appear in a peanut butter commercial and we thought we'd bring Susie.
You know, because of that one time you got in the trash and ate a whole jar of recalled peanut butter?
Hey. Hey. This is you. I'm Brian. I like garbage peanut butter, and I wear my 'I Voted' sticker for a week and a half.
We're sorry that it's airing during 2 Broke Girls, but we have no control over that.
We haven't had a celebrity in the family since my great-aunt, Queen of Burlesque Griffin.
Yeah, yeah, but, you know, maybe we should keep a little bit out to celebrate.
You know, this is a nice dinner and all, but I thought you guys were going to save this commercial money for Stewie's college fund.
Yeah, and besides, it's been a while since we ate at a place where if you ask for ketchup, they look at you like you're dirt.
I mean... I mean, the world of child acting can be a pretty bad environment for a kid.
Okay, Stewie, you booked the last commercial without even trying, so this one should be a piece of cake.
And you'd have no way of knowing that my son is the Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.
Hi, everybody, we're a little crunched for time, so we're gonna have to audition people right here in the hallway.
Holy Christmas, there were a lot of hot moms in yoga pants in there though.
I haven't seen the fat man this upset since he went to the 9/11 museum.
Lois made us do this, but I wanted to go to the Central Park merry-go-round.
Stewie has another audition tomorrow, and we're not gonna be embarrassed like we were today.
It's one part 5-Hour Energy, and the other three hours are espresso, Scotts Turf Builder, and a tiny, tiny super-small amount of cocaine.
Okay, Stewie, you're just gonna drink this juice, then say, Mmm, and rub your belly.
Stewie booked that orange juice commercial, so we thought we'd make a few upgrades around the house.
I can't make him attack you, Brian, but if I keep printing them, eventually one will go after you.
And for what? So Peter and Lois can spend the money you earned on crap they don't even need?
Oh, I'm just here to look at other people's e-mails who haven't logged out. And how's business?
If you're gonna continue on this path, you need to know what your future holds.
You remember that kid from A Christmas Story who got his tongue stuck to that pole?
They all started out just like you, but eventually they were destroyed by their parents' greed, drugs or perverted Hollywood directors.
Yes, well, if they want to make me into a monster like those people, we'll give 'em a monster.
Okay, Stewie, when Barbara hands you that orange juice, you're gonna drink it and smile.
I-I guess we just got too caught up in your success and forgot that you're just a baby.
Well, the good news is that now he can go back to being a regular kid.
You know, Brian, that acting stuff was a bit much for me, but I did quite enjoy the dancing and the cocaine.
For a while. I might crash when I'm 18, but then I'll just turn to the Lord and working out.
I used to need drugs to feel powerful, but now my power comes from my core strength.
And remember, while we're off getting our massages, you and Daddy are gonna spend the day together here.
Look, I'm sorry, but my mom said he can't be left alone at home anymore.
Man, spending a whole day with him is gonna be worse than eating at a ball park.
Uh, I'll take one terrible beer, filled up way too high, so I spill most of it, and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun.
I can't wait to have diarrhea in the stall with no door while 20 guys wait for me to finish.
I'm just finishing up an e-mail to Delta. I have never not screamed at the top of my lungs during air pressure changes, and I do not intend to stop now.
You want to see a guy in a human-sized hamster ball roll off a mountain?
All he needs is a hundred grand to pay legal fees, and then as soon as he gets his money, I get a million bucks.
Oh, it was fine, though I don't know why they made us face each other during the mother-daughter bikini wax.
Well, come on, Mom, the man was very specific that we need to go put lotion on each other.
Oh, just so you know, I didn't tell Lois where we're going, and I couldn't be touched until I was two.
You know, they say there's some animal species here that haven't even been discovered yet.
That African warlord is brutalizing those innocent people. Yeah, but it's okay, because he's wearing a large cowboy hat and follows everything with hamburger, like that stand-up comic from the '90s.
After 18 hours in the mines, we are going to check your butts for diamonds.
I've got $7.50 left on my Panda Express card if you want to split a three-item combo.
Okay, hold on. Shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I answer this call.
Sir, shoot me if you must, but it is imperative that I look at these pictures.
It is with the money that you sent that we have been able to make many wonderful improvements to our village.
It was your money that paid for the school, a well to provide clean drinking water, our first health clinic, and a Redbox with one movie in it.
Which I, personally, could begin watching at any point in the film and enjoy from there.
Oh, yeah, that's how I feel about that video of Kelsey Grammer fallin' off the stage.
No. You see, no one will actually give money to Africa unless they are tricked into it.
You don't want to be the first white guy to do something bad to Africa.
I have no choice but to write a memoir of my struggles. Chapter One: Harry Potter's aunt and uncle were super mean. 'Spank me harder,' the lady says to Fifty Shades of Grey. 'That's Mr. Fifty Shades of Grey to you, Kate from Ben and Kate.' And then he turned her butt inside out.
Because, sexy. 'Isn't that special,' said the Church Lady, before reporting for her botched surgery. Anyway, I'm here in a prison against my will, and I should be free.
But, in other news, domestic abuse enthusiast Paul Simon has released a new song inspired by a memoir written by Quahog's own Peter Griffin, who has been falsely imprisoned by his father-in-law in an African jail.
I was just saying that because I was worried you'd become popular and not want to be friends with us anymore.
Meg, I'm $18 into this evening, so can you maybe just get out of here?
Even at the speed of light, mean-spirited thoughts from the stars can take thousands or even millions of years to reach the Earth.
Now wait, let me get this straight: none of you guys has ever heard of Bono?
For God's sake, I can't even be left alone in my own house for an afternoon.
You have to drop me off at your house so this fat idiot can babysit me!
Listen, when I get home, I'll transfer enough money so you can rebuild your town.
You know, when they recorded Movin' Out, someone left the studio doors open, and that's why, at the end, you hear that car sound.
Peter, I'm gonna punch you with this beer mug till I'm holding just the handle!
Well, I've got to go to church, but I don't have time to change from the rodeo.
Excuse me, I thought you were helping me find a look that'll let me cling to my youth in my 40s.
Joanne was supposed to drive me to the club, but she's having throat surgery. menthol slims.
For example, I also write restaurant reviews for the newspaper under the name Hugh Cornwallis.
No, I might also hit the treadmill and watch Kelly and Michael on mute with closed captioning.
Well, I just found out about these things called apps, so that's kind of all I do now.
Ugh. I went out of town for a little while, but I made the mistake of using this app called Bear B'n'B.
Just a reminder, we ask that you not use the DVD player, but you can watch any of the VHSs.
The house specialty is a half-chewed trout we yanked out of the river with our teeth.
Yeah. And then you can use the rice to pretend someone wanted to marry you.
She bought feminine products at my dad's pharmacy, so you know she's up and running.
If you want to get a girl's attention, you text her a picture of your penis.
You married me because I play one of the main bad guys in Blue Bloods.
We've got a bit of a situation, which is why I've asked Officer Swanson to join us.
And apparently the girl... Oh, thank God. ...he sent it to doesn't like him back, so she turned him in.
I don't know what to say, but the laws just haven't caught up to how cool kids are now.
Well, I'm not about to make a Batman exit right now, but has that thing always been over there?
Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin, whose name will be omitted here, was caught sending, quote-unquote, graphic selfies of his hog-- not sure where that quote is from-- to another underage student.
When I was your age, boys used to just whip it out on the bus.
Oh, I wish you could, sweetie, but the law says that, as a sex offender, you have to complete a rehabilitation course.
I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork, rum, macadamia nuts, stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf, sentimental military stuff, lava, people who I can't tell are black or Asian, apostrophes, anyone twirling flames, second weddings and linen pants.
All right, before we begin, whoever's driving a windowless van painted like an ice cream truck, your lights are on.
I can't believe we're having an ice cream cake to celebrate Chris graduating from sex offender school.
You can go back to being a normal boy and put all this behind you.
Mr. Quagmire, I completed that sex rehab and I paid my debt to society, but people are still afraid of me, like I'm some kind of creep.
How do I get them to treat me the way they did before all this happened?
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris, but you're just gonna have to accept that from now on, people are gonna see you as a sex-crazed pervert.
Now nobody will have any reason to be afraid of me or think I'm a pervert, and everybody can just treat me like normal again.
Look, Chris, I know you think chemical castration is gonna solve your problems, but you have to stop taking those pills.
I don't have to do anything, besides get to the wind chime store before it closes.
Thanks. You know, I just pretend that tennis ball is Mitch McConnell trying to roll back subsidies on the Affordable Care Act, and I'm like, Nope!
There's a lot of great things about having a sex drive that you're missing out on. Like what?
It's only a matter of time before he shaves one side of his head and swoops the rest of the hair over.
That's spanking it? Yes, Peter. ...I have managed to redirect that energy into my studies.
Not only that, I got the highest score on my Spanish test, and I even joined the debate team.
All right, well, I'm gonna put some flowers in a wagon and walk around town.
Not thinking about sex all the time seems to have allowed Chris to excel in other areas.
I can already see our names in the newsletter, right below the deaths from the previous quarter.
I will drop you to your knees and shove my racket so far down your throat you'll be my grip for a week!
So to find the area of this circle, we're going to need to use pi, whose digits go on forever.
Yeah, he took my phone to look at pictures of my friends, and he found the one you sent.
Well, Chris, you killed that librarian, but we're glad to have you back to your old self.
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.
Black guys put hot sauce on everything, on account of most of us been pepper-sprayed by the time we're two.
I'll give you ten bucks if you drink an entire shot glass of that hot sauce.
If you're anything like me, the number one problem in your life is that you can't masturbate just anywhere.
Our patented process makes it look like you're... holding the remote or sipping a beer.
I got one. I'll give you ten bucks if you wear the same pair of underwear for a month.
So, uh, I guess this means Peter, you're our Joe now, and Joe, you're our Peter.
All right, we're gonna open this fire hydrant and you're gonna drink as much water from it as you can.
But first, the public library suffered damage this evening when an area fat man smashed through the front of the building while attempting a drunken stunt.
In light of events at the library, we now go live to a press conference at the mayor's residence.
And if we can't trust a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly, then I have no choice but to take action.
And if there's one thing the new drinking age law has done, it's let us know that women tell terrible stories.
Joyce, I'm standing here on the streets of Quahog, where citizens are feeling the effects of the city's new drinking law.
I was going to bone my girlfriend, but she told me that if there wasn't vanilla vodka involved, there was no way.
I think we just have to trust our elected officials... and Goldman's Pharmacy is fully stocked on cough syrup, which goes great with ginger ale.
Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I'm actually thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.
And I got to say, it was kind of uncool of Mayor West to call it Peter's Law.
Oh, you know... you know, I just remembered, there's no beer here, l-let's- let's just, let's just go.
The man who made it, Curtis Murder Dog Williams, went on to become one of America's most celebrated vintners.
If we can't buy alcohol in Quahog, we'll just go to the next town over.
Sorry, in this town, you can only buy alcohol if you're dressed head-to-toe in jeans.
I tell you, guys, getting alcohol when you're underage isn't as easy as Obama's daughters make it look.
Brian, I think we can get John Mayer to stop tweeting again, but we all got to work together.
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging out with my main man, Peter. Main man? Hanging out?
It hasn't dawned on you that he only started spending time with you when the drinking age was raised?
Trust me, as soon as you're no longer of use to him, he'll be done with you.
Brian, do you have any idea why Peter was trying to climb in the dishwasher?
I know Lois gets mad about it, but I like using them to point at things.
All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on, so I'm gonna go bite at the water a little bit.
Well, you better tell me who that is or you're in a lot of trouble.
Nah, I'm just gonna stay here until the sun comes up and then be the best at tetherball.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a half a can of hot beer left in this open container I've been driving around with.
Well, I'm not the smartest man in the world, but I can always look back on my life and say I went for it.
Hey, can one of you guys with elbows try to get this truck to honk?
I bet if we worked together we could find a way to change it back.
I've been doing some research, and it says here that in eight months, we can get a non-binding proposition on the ballot as long as we get 4,000 signatures.
And everybody knows the best way to get any law struck down is to get the gays angry about it.
I mean, it's already ruined a friendship with one of the best guys I know!
It helps us forget about our day and tell our children we love 'em with a straight face.
And it gives people the courage to sneak onto their mayor's property and blackmail him and eat all his ripe tomatoes.
Just goes to show, if anybody wants a law changed, they should just go to their mayor's house.
Well, to be honest, Brian, at first I did just want you to buy us beer.
Hey, on your way out, could you put this in my mailbox for the mailman?
Well, Peter, I'm just happy that you and Brian managed to get that law repealed, and that you're finally friends again.
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.
Black guys put hot sauce on everything, on account of most of us been pepper-sprayed by the time we're two.

Thank you all so much for coming this evening to my very fancy dinner party.
Well, thank you. And you're the prettiest of all the women I know whose name is Glenn.
It seems weird that I'd have a joke in my own dream that I don't get. Oh, thank you so...
Like, how does that candle in Beauty and the Beast sing so good? I mean, the teapot I get,
Oh, hey, Brian. Stewie kind of took over our bed, so I'm looking for a place to sleep.
I don't know. Maybe I'll get a job working the night shift at a supermarket.
Oh, hey, Lois. Welcome to the Pete Pad, where the dancing's hot, the drinks are hot...
I was just sitting here on the couch and I had another nightmare about that horrible monster.
Okay, Stewie, I read the review of a dream book on Amazon, so I think I can help you.
So maybe if we make a list of the things you're most afraid of, we can face and conquer these fears together, and then your nightmares'll end.
Hey, I brought construction paper and markers in case you guys want to draw breasts.
Peter Doesn't Have to Take Out the Trash coupon that I got for my anniversary.
That's it. This is our home, not some frat house for you and your friends.
Well, that's what I said, but then he did it, and I was like, Oh, all right, okay, yeah, kind of.
You see, once connected to this device, you will be able to enter my sleeping mind, where you will end these horrible dreams once and for all.
You and I will place these cranial impulse receptor caps on our heads, I shall begin my slumber, and...
And once you're in my dream, your job is to stop these nightmares by finding that monster and killing him.
B, run downhill, or C, stand your ground? ...and just because of the roles I play, people always assume I'm very serious in real life.
Stewie, hey! I'm here to find and kill the monster that's been causing all your nightmares.
I would've been here sooner, but one of my legs is a snake that's very hungry for mice.
Maybe this means that deep down, the thing I'm most afraid of is disappointing you.
You've been more of a father figure to me than the fat man ever has been or ever will be.
Look, I know I'm always busting your balls, but it's just because you're the only person in this house whose judgment actually matters to me.
I mean, you're only a baby, and yet, you're one of the most amazing people I know.
Oh, yeah, no, that one stays locked until the overnight to Vegas with my college a cappella group.
I-I don't know if it got on the dress or not, Lois, but I-I am... I am so sorry.
Sure did. Turned out that monster was nothing more than a manifestation of your subconscious desire not to disappoint me.
You are a good person. Stop complimenting me. Oh, I sure hope the dog approves of who I am.
Thank you all so much for coming this evening to my very fancy dinner party.
Well, thank you. And you're the prettiest of all the women I know whose name is Glenn.

You are a good person. Stop complimenting me. Oh, I sure hope the dog approves of who I am.
Here, we brought you guys an orchid from Trader Joe's, because we don't know or care about any of your interests.
Well, let's break for presents, but after that, I'll show you Susie's birth video, and I'll tell you, she fell out of there like an orange out of an old dress sock.
I wanted to do with my life, but now, I'm 46, and all I've ever done is take care of Joe.
And now you feel like you never had a chance to be your true self.
I mean, I'm happy that Peter found me and gave me a home, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier on my own.
Uh, before I start, are these the normal kids or kind of the dur, dur ones?
It's that time of the year again to fulfill your community service requirement by signing up for volunteer work.
The jobs will be assigned randomly but the cooler and prettier students have the better jobs.
For instance, blonde chick in the third row will wash my car this afternoon while, Little Miss Frumpkin with all the questions, will work in an old folks' home.
Yeah, I figured it was the least we could do, since you pulled up a beheading video on your phone at their party and showed it to everyone.
But the Operation game is out of batteries, so I'll have to make the noise.
Yeah, I me... I mean, there's... there's definitely some kind of connection between us, but...
Okay, here we go, uh, uh, crippled guy... uh, cheating wife... uh, uh, cheating wife of a crippled guy...
Well, I hope your day gets better, Brian, but, uh, I wouldn't count on it.
Boy, it wasn't easy Mrs. Parkhurst, but I think we got the nail that was poking through your slipper.
Well, you strike me as someone who's never going to get married, that's for sure.
I, uh, feel that things have been awkward between us, but just to show you there's no hard feelings, can I buy you a drink?
Hurry, take everything, and be quick or we'll be in bigger trouble than a fat guy at a water park.
All right, now when Joe gets here we're just going to tell him he needs to lighten up on Brian, and then we'll all talk this thing out so we can move past it.
But we think that you're taking this revenge on Brian just a little too far.
Even though Brian's been trying to do my wife for years, and on some level, I hate him for it.
Oh, Brian's a complete dick, we all know that, but I think we're losing sight of the point that Bonnie's a weird slut who's always letting you know she's open for business.
I'm Bonnie's friend, but she could sometimes get the mail in something other than a robe.
Quagmire, I want you to think of a card, but do not tell me what it is.
Can you hand me another nylon that I use as a sock with my huge beige shoe?
And I'd have to give a toast, and say that Bonnie's the best thing that ever happened to him.
You know, she is the best thing that ever happened to him, but don't worry, Joe.
If you could talk with even a little bit of inflection to your voice, so it doesn't sound so much like a power sander.
Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room, and then I'm done with my volunteer hours and we never come back here again.
Listen, we're very sorry we stole from you, but you have it all back now, so we cool, right?
You will spend time with us every afternoon after school, doing jigsaw puzzles, reading us the newspaper, listening to poorly remembered stories that have no point.
See, if I make under 20 grand for 20 years, my film school debt just goes away.
Any time I quiet my mind and clear my heart, it always leads me to you.
Over the years, I probably have become too dependent on you, and I'm sorry if you've had to put your dreams on hold because of me.
I promise I'll spend the rest of my days taking care of you, just the way you've always taken care of me.
So Chris and I learned that just 'cause people are old, that doesn't mean you should steal from them.
Really? Is that the one where they make 'em dress in the little shorts and hats like the guy in AC/DC?
Oh, no, we got to start saving our pennies now that we're sending Stewie to a new school.
Yeah, I'd be happy to get you an interview, and as a white woman, you'd be a minority here, unless you're an alcoholic.
Oh, the post office anticipates that within the next five years at least 200 million men in this country will be ordering and receiving RealDolls.
Asians, blonde Southern girls, blonde Asians capable of performing every possible sexual act, or at least incapable of refusing.
You can put one in your car and drive in the car pool lane with it and then maybe you push her head down, thus defeating the purpose of the car pool lane while fulfilling the purpose of the RealDoll.
Maybe later you ask yourself some tough questions, like, Why is it so important to you to impress and excite truckers?
Another good postal tip is, if you wait to deliver your mail at night, you can smell a lot of really nice dinners.
Oh, it's fine, I suppose, but you probably have even nicer things at your mansion.
Come on, let's go see if the maid brought her son, so we can push him and he can't do anything.
And so I say to you, America, we are going to win this war, we're going to end this depression, and there's no reason to suspect that I cannot walk.
I-It just says Hollywood, U.S.A., and this isn't a stamp, it's the little sticker from an apple.
It's all the stale mail what never got delivered for one reason or the other: incomplete addresses, house at the top of a hill, anyone who uses one of those
You know, you do the uniform proud, like I like to think I-- oh, chili dog got me.
Aw, there was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club got a lot of mail.
Well, then why don't you just deliver the letter and see for yourself who this Gretchen Mercer is?
No, he won't talk about anything serious unless there's a crackling fire to punctuate uncomfortable family revelations.
I've seen the fat man pee through Lois' legs while she's sitting on the toilet.
What I've got to do is find a spectacular house that I can pretend is mine to impress Chadley.
He was just writing to say that he was excited about getting married and that he finally had enough
My mother dipped me into the River Styx and she held me by my heels, so that's the only part that can be injured.
And when it does, I'll be as popular as the first kid in school to get his driver's license.
Yeah, or maybe you and me hop in that car of yours and do some grocery shopping?
You know, the one where you said that you were having doubts about marrying Lois and you still had thoughts about marrying me.
Oh, then I suppose your wife is entitled to know that you were still in love with me just days before your wedding.
Look, Gretchen, I-I know I wrote you that letter, and-and-and I meant it at the time, but... it was 20 years ago!
It's just that when I got this letter, it reminded me how sweet and funny you always were.
Thanks for not making fun of me for ordering a hot chocolate, and go ahead and look into Facebook
Wait, before we say our final good-bye, what do you say we have one last hurrah?
Let me go home with one last good memory, and then I promise, you have heard the last of Gretchen Mercer.
Well, I should probably say no, but I've never been known for my good judgment.
I mean it's not like anybody I know would be at a Ray LaMontagne concert.
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to have finally found a group of peers with whom
Not to be too intimate, but I need to have a bowel movement and I can't go here.
Gretchen wants to kill you, and I have a slip that says we've got a package?
Not a day goes by where I don't thank my lucky stars for picking you.
Well, they didn't like me beating up Gretchen on federal property, and then after your father plugged up that P.O. box, there was a mutual parting of the ways.
Well, Stewie, I guess since Lois lost her job, you're not going to be able to go to that fancy preschool anymore.
Me and the guys were using them to shoot crab apples at Old Man McCratchen's truck.
To try and get my shoes sucked into the escalator so we can sue the mall.
Okay, well, if he's the conductor, why don't he have electrical tape wrapped around him for safety?
Sorry, sorry, my buddy sent me a bunch of Romanian porn, and now every girl I look at I imagine throwing onto a table.
Hey, I bet lots of millionaires come in here and hit on you all the time, huh?
I'd stop, but Catherine Zeta Jones' big hands are on the back of my head.
Say something! ...and I turned around, and I don't know what happened to my wife, and now I'm all alone and I'm just so scared.
Do you want to go look for your wife, or you want me to finish the makeover?
Are you still-- by the way, you have no idea what a helicopter sounds like-- are you still keeping up this charade?
Shelby's already off work, so I'll just grab the ring and we can bring it back before they close.
If you're referring to the ring that I thought was a lug nut, I ate it.
If this train slows to less than 50 miles an hour, then Sandra Bullock has to marry a neo-Nazi and act like she didn't know about it, and then overcompensate by adopting a black kid.
But we begin with breaking news from the Quahog Mall, where a local fat man was stuck overnight on a child's train.
We now go live to the newest member of the Channel Five news team, Dallas Portland.
We had a bottle of wine and a joint at Bonnie's house, and we want to watch Dallas Portland before the buzz wears off.
I'm here in his studio above the Petco to see if I want to nama-stay for the whole class.
I don't know about none of that, but look at that bulge in his shorts.
Well, we got to get that ring out of you, and this is a place where people buy disgusting cereals to help them poop.
Are there any gray-haired lesbian art teachers who can help us select a fiber cereal?
I was just trying to get this guy to poop, but now we're this close to getting sex outlawed in the United States.
Getting out of that wind storm that screwed up my hair and loosened my tie, but also trying to forget how mad I am at Dallas Portland.
Sorry, I still get a little dizzy from the train, but if Dallas Portland's on TV every night, my life's gonna be a living hell.
Without the news, I... I don't know who I am... but what can you do?
But wait a minute, maybe if we work together, we can solve both our problems.
Well, if he's the hot, young thing and everybody loves him, all we got to do is make you hotter and younger and thing-er!
I'm doing this for my mother, who taught me to sing when I was only seven.
She was my biggest inspiration, and she was... taken from me when I was 12... in a fatal car accident.
All right, Tom, if you want to be young these days, you gotta do a wicked awesome GoPro skate video.
Okay, Tom, uh, our top story tonight: a burst water pipe in the pediatric unit of Quahog General results in the tragic drowning deaths of four children and one nurse.
Katie Couric went on TV and stuck a tube up her butt and they threw her a parade.
It's like when you watch Mad Men for that chick you said was like a fat me.
Today on CBS This Morning, we'll be talking about how much sleep you need to not be drunk from the night before.
We'll just have to take a bumpy ride to the mall and hope for a miracle.
You know, Brian, this wouldn't have happened if you were just honest with women and had an ounce of integrity.
Yes, um, I'd like to make a return, please... and maybe take you to dinner?
Before you jump, could you just hand me this microphone, like you're passing me the torch?
Tom was just trying to talk me down, and if there's a news story here, the only one I'm giving it to is Tom Tucker.
This is Tom Tucker atop a roof, where a local crazy person is preparing to end it all.
I'm doing this because I ruined a guy's life... and I feel awful about it.
Well, whoever this guy is, I'm sure he appreciates what you're trying to do for him.
Well, I'm glad your crazy stunt worked out and Tom Tucker is back at Channel Five.
Yeah, apparently, when he interviewed me up on that roof, the ratings were so huge, they made him anchor again.
And as a special treat, I thought I'd deliver them in the rapping style you kids are so enthused about.
Maybe I'll surprise everyone, like when you find out a buttoned-up librarian is actually super sexy.
We got to be at that school tomorrow to help pick up the pieces when he loses.
We're gonna go down to Carver High School and look at that mural of black achievement.
And if you elect me, I will be as good a homecoming king as a touchdown.
Webster's dictionary defines smegma as a sebaceous, cheese-like substance around the head of the penis.
All right, students. The votes have been tabulated, so if you could all look up from your phones for a minute,
I brought a bag of marshmallows and a belt for Chris to bite on during his meltdown.
All right, now it's time for these four poor kids to thank you for subsidizing their lunches.
Well, as king, I shall eat this breakfast on a tray in front of Wheel of Fortune.
The only reason they elected him king is because they're gonna prank him at homecoming.
I don't know, but if they are, we got to get down to that school and talk 'em out of it.
They looked in the wardrobe and discovered that the stylist had only brought non-skinny jeans!
All right, if we want Cleveland to stop spending all his time with Jerome, we got to remind him how much fun we are.
All right, if we want to get Cleveland back, we should just put out his favorite snack: an open can of tuna.
All right, let's find the coolest kids here, and see if they know anything about a prank on Chris.
I don't know my way around the school, so I figured I'd get the deets from a couple of seniors.
Well, we realized you like hanging out with Jerome because he's black, so we wanted you to know we can be black guys, too.
I hang out with Jerome because, unlike some people, he actually takes an interest in my life.
And he would never stick me with the bill by walking out on me at the Clam.
And finally, tonight, a moving story from James Woods High, where the student body has made their homecoming a special event for a very special boy.
That's right. Chris Griffin, a tubby spaz with a heart full of dreams, gets to feel normal for a night, thanks to the kindness of his peers.
I just see him walking around with his hands down his pants all day, and he's just so fat and weird, so we feel bad.
Yeah, last year we did the burnt up kid, so this was a slam dunk.
Oh, my God, they just elected him out of pity, because they think he's mentally challenged.
The only reason Chris is homecoming king is that all the other kids feel sorry for him.
In fact, this whole homecoming king thing seems to have just gone straight to his head.
Peter and the fellas think that you and I only hang out together because we're both black.
I mean, you don't think I hang out with you because of your endless stories about working your remote control or your fat son or how you once made a dog shake its head no?
Well, because they all think you're a, um, you know, groundskeeper at a public institution kind of guy.
Tonight, when they put that crown on my head, it's gonna be the greatest night of my life.
Hanging with Jerome was fun, but my best friends are right here in this room.
Okay, but no stupid-ass shots from the corner, because that's a glitch in the software and...
Amazing. One second of a stranger's voice on a phone and you've got full Bollywood.
Bonnie's out of town, so I have an extra ticket for Tuesday night bingo down at the Allendale Mill.
There's the thrill of the game, people bring snacks, plus you'll hear some pretty unfiltered opinions about those jokers in Washington.
How come over there they just talk on the phone, and over here they're all doctors?
Get out of here. Lois said you're supposed to sit on the potty for one hour straight.
Oh, you just must be cracking up all the time hanging out with this one.
Or-or how about this one? Oh... my God, I want to kill myself right now.
Come on, I think I see a cab with less than nine people in it.
Look, Joe, I'm a little busy right now, so I'm gonna have the Somali pirate from Captain Phillips tell you something.
I'm just going to stand here wearing a shirt that appears to be a jacket.
I'm sorry, Lois, but my people have come to expect a certain degree of pageantry.
Now, you go over there and take him with you, or I don't want you going at all.
And what that is is to indicate our international sales, which peaked, of course,  Oh, yeah. during the last quarter.
Do you take this woman to lecture you about trans fats for as long as you both shall live?
And do you take this man to be a watered-down Bono until death do you part?
I hope they play that one song with the shrieking, nasal, atonal woman over the bongos and tambourines.
Yeah. Well, that, and this is always what it looks like on Homeland right before there's a drone strike.
Family, guests, and monkeys who have wandered in to steal fruit, it is my honor to welcome you to this engagement celebration.
Everyone, you are all so kind to come tonight, and it is so nice to meet you, Dhiraj.
Great, just give me a chance to raise the money, so I can marry your daughter and make her happy.
And second of all, we're about to play a new round, so start taking your pants off,
As a friend, do the right thing and give Joe back the happiness he found here.
Damn it, I didn't want to have to do this, but you've left me no choice!
Trust me, Brian, there are a billion people here, and almost every one of them has a tapeworm.
I originally just came for my junior year, but I fell in love with the place.
Stewie, there's no way I'm sitting here all day watching tapeworms come out of butts.
My father has solved the problem by promising Dhiraj the hand of my younger sister.
Wait a minute, so if, if Dhiraj is marrying your sister, that means we can be together!
Brian, I am deeply touched that you came all this way to find me, but the truth is, you and I have very little in common.
I mean, I mean, there's got to be an old Carmen Sandiego episode on India or something.
Oh, in India it's traditional to do a final musical curtain call over the end credits.
We now return to the extended director's cut of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Huh. This one's dry, but the back of the seat in front of it is wet.
Uch. All they're doing is announcing that they play the kazoo, and then asking if others also play the kazoo.
If you want a song a baby'll like, you've got to get a baby to write it.
I'm gonna go across that river and make it to the city on the other side.
Well, Will Smith's little kid works as a movie star, even though he looks like a wet baby horse.
Well, maybe even my old job as the guy racing through an airport at the end of a romantic comedy.
All right, Brian, I've written a few songs, all about stuff babies actually care about.
Easy. I figured out the perfect way to get the word out to middle-aged moms.
I am just so busy, I-I don't have any time to organize my own life.
Wait a minute, what if you had someone to help keep you organized? Chris is looking for work.
Oh, the birthday boy and I met at Burt Reynolds' acting camp in Jupiter, Florida.
It's about those six children watching and the spazzy kid who's just waiting for the snakes.
Okay, kids, if everyone's done washing their hands from the snakes, we have some fun music for y...
All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt, and here's a song we call Mommy and Daddy's Room.
Your paperwork appears to be in order, but before we get started, do you own a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear if you worked on a fishing boat?
All right, I guess it'll be a light day today, but tomorrow you should come wearing those.
Now, the first thing I need you to do every morning is punch me in the stomach because I'm a bad person.
You know, I talk a lot of smack, but at the end of the day, these guys are pros.
Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs, you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod...
Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like damn you all or what the dude or whatever.
Does it-does it sound through the mic like I'm saying dude? Should it be dude?
I don't know. I'm just saying, after every show, the fans are always petting Brian, and not you.
And would you like to leave your panties in the fishbowl for a chance to win a free lunch?
I'll tell you what my problem is: I'm doing all the work and you're just riding my coattails.
What are you talking about? I'm just as big a part of this group as you are.
And I don't know if you've considered this, but the clock is ticking on Stewie's cuteness.
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up looking like an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.
I could wear a shirt that's both red and blue, and you can do spin art with all the wussy kids who are afraid to go on rides.
If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180.
So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us and go back to the way things were?
Oh, that's Woody Allen's son, but you're right, that other guy behind him is Frank Sinatra, Jr.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that, but it's a shame we can't get good Italian food like this in Quahog.
You're supposed to yell Bella, Bella and grab as much fat ass as you can.
I got to get down to the business center to print out my boarding pass.
Hey, look, I don't know if you guys are really staying here, but you can't get into the pool without a room key.
Okay, Chris, your mom and I want to help you get out some of that aggression, so I thought you and me could huck rotten apples at passing cars.
Well, I'm Coach Doyle, and I head up the baseball team at James Woods High.
Then I realized how stupid that is and I went to the bank for a loan like an adult.
James Woods is winning for now, but y'all never know what might happen in the moments to come.
Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck.
This dad took one look at Chris and thought he'd suck, but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.
You know, I bet there are plenty of other baseball dads who'd also assume Chris stinks.
Our top story tonight, the James Woods High baseball team is headed to the district championship, thanks to their secret weapon, star pitcher Chris Griffin.
Well, there are plenty of guys willing to bet on James Woods High to win, I'll tell you that.
All we got to do is take those bets and get Chris to take a dive!
You may not believe this, but there was a time when Snapple ruled the nation.
What do you think puts the food on our table and the garbage bags on our backs?!
When you get on that field, you try your very best and play to win.
All right, I'm gonna exit while discreetly checking out the hot chick by the door.
I don't know what that means, but let's go rough up a teenager for beer money!
Trust me. I bought the absolute latest issue of Archie comics, and this is what the kids are wearing.
As is the case with many restaurants, you're going to have to pay for your food.
If you need me, I'll be back in Palm Springs, which has been completely taken over by the gays.
Maybe, but first, let's have an unearned end-of-the-series moment where we turn out the lights on our own place.
Quagmire, this is humbling, but it may be time for all of us to talk about hearing aids.
Look, I was wrong to bet on your games, and it's even worse that I told you to lose.
I just feel bad that my arm is broken in so many places and hurts so much.
Well, for the last few weeks, since my right arm's been exhausted from pitching, my left arm's had to, uh, pick up the slack in the bathroom.
The next pitch Chris threw hit his coach in the head, so there was no one to take him out of the game.
But at least I didn't have to pay out all those bets and kiss a guy.
Coming up, why one hello a day to the receptionist at work is the magic number.
Well, if you need insurance that bad, maybe it's time for you to go out and get a job of your own.
Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News in front of the old boob tube.
If it weren't respectable, why would real estate agents go to strip clubs for lunch?
Captain Cockpit, my friend is about to get married, and we were wondering if you'd have sex with her for $500.
N... uh, no, I, uh, uh, w-wanted to know if Quagmire was available tomorrow evening?
Uh, but I'm unable to properly have sex with my wife, so I figured, you know.
I was sweating that pilot strike, but now that I'm a gigolo, I'm making money by the fistful.
Hey, Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice you got some dry cleaning hanging up in the backseat of your car.
One of my tricks drove me here from the Clam, and I didn't have any money for a cab.
I mean, my days are pretty open, and I don't sleep a lot at night 'cause of health stuff.
Hey, maybe you could drive me around and help me out, and I could even pay you a little something for your time.
Maybe from the store, but it's not like things take a day off from needing repairs, am I right?
I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig a shim jamb strap hinge quarter-round soffit two-by-six dowel cherry-picker flim-flam.
You know, Rupert, Brian's douche-iness should infuriate me, but the truth is he seems happy.
I didn't know we'd be doing this pimp thing, but I made a promise to my body.
You can't have my bread, but you can have something of mine that smells like bread.
All right, Rupert, if we're going to teach Brian a lesson, we're going to need some muscle.
Anyone who doesn't enjoy the music of Josh Groban can get out of the (BLEEP) car.
Okay, if you had a friend who worked at Mega Hardware, how would you get him fired?
Okay, is there any idea out there besides killing a guy or getting someone deported?
Well, you just offered to kill a guy, so you're not exactly number one on my roommate list.
I hear on SNL the women are funnier than the guys now, but I don't know, I'll never see it.
We meet Quagmire, a small-town boy with big-city dreams who has fallen deep into the game of prostitution at the Point.
You know, some people ask me, Would you want your son to be a hooker?
I kind of want to see Guardians of the Galaxy, but I also kind of feel like there might be scary parts.
You know what that means? Shopping for groceries is what I say instead of, Do you want to pay me for sex? so I can't get arrested.
Stewie, did you hire three Mexican guys to shake a soda can and give it to my boss?
It says I have to make an incision, retract the hernia sac, and then suture the abdominal lining.
And then hold the incision open with a vise grip, and use the slip-joint pliers to get the muscle back in position.
I've got to say, Brian, it seems like you really did learn something on that job.
I guess I just got caught up in the money and-and assumed you were okay with it because of the sex.
Can you find it in yourself to forgive me, and maybe we can just go back to being friends?
Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.
You might know me from banging your niece on a pile of your brother's pool equipment.
But tonight, I'm here to take you behind the scenes on the set of Family Guy.
For the first time ever, you'll see what a typical production week is like for TV's 11th favorite family.
It's certainly not easy being a family that also happens to star in a sitcom together.
Especially last year, when I discovered those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern on Peter's phone.
But he explained that his phone number was the old number of-of her ex-boyfriend, so... what was it again?
So the photos were on the Cloud, and that the-the Cloud pulled the pictures or...?
I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him, and that's why he has them.
And-and we both called the Apple store, and they said they can't disprove that it doesn't happen, so here we are, still married, still on the show.
A-And it's happened five times since then, and some of the pictures had both Peter and the girl in them.
'Cause what guy doesn't want to go to his office and have his family there?
You know, and then you go home after work and catch up with the family.
Just trying to make it to the weekend, so you can, uh... spend some time with the family.
What they didn't know is that I'd been privately doing jokes about the newspaper for years.
But, you know, it's not just the Griffins who work hard to make Family Guy what it is.
You know, a lot of people don't realize SEAL Team Six actually completed their mission in this puppy.
Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy, and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.
The only reason I stay here is to maintain my profile for my start-up business, DiscreetCrepe.com.
Hi. Are you a straight, adult male who likes to eat crepes without people making unwanted assumptions about your private life?
Now I just need a guy's butt to eat this off of, and I got myself a night.
And here we are... the Family Guy writers' room... where the writers are hard at work with the show's talented cast.
Look, don't get me wrong, guys, I-I think it's hilarious, and-and I totally get that the sex thing is what made me popular, but would it kill us to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?
Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant where he was spying on ladies peeing in the bathroom.
As part of the class-action settlement, he entered rehab, and that's where he found Jesus.
He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set, which is, like, a totally real thing.
And I think someone may have placed an anonymous phone call to the network about it.
Word around the stage is they've decided to finally fire Peter and replace him with another actor.
Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes, so he could shoot that crappy movie... what was it?
It was a remake of Old Yeller where the dog gets the drop on him and kills him first.
I mean, Dad's the only one in the whole production who doesn't know he's being fired.
The table read is where the Family Guy cast reads aloud that week's script to see how the story and the jokes are working.
Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read for this week's episode, entitled, Peter Dies (We're Really Serious, No Joke,
Here, let me show you. Interior, Griffins' living room, day. Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.
My time machine got a virus that causes Dad to die again if it's ever used.
They'd have to bring in someone to replace me. Uncle Ricky, played by sitcom buzzard
Yeah, Peter, we love you, and-and you're still part of the family, just not part of the show.
All right, fine, you bastards can fire me, but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.
Boy, we picked quite a week to document the production of a Family Guy episode.
Given this surprising development, we decided to follow Peter, and see if our cameras could capture his story, as well.
Chateau Marmont Hotel, where I once engaged in the consensual murder of an underaged prostitute.
Yeah, well, I figured if my family doesn't want me on the show, there's no reason I should keep living with them.
I-I mean, there's no hard feelings, um, I just feel like this is best for me, and this is best for those cancerous dicks.
When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?
I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store, and now here I am, stuck eating cereal for dinner with a kid.
Wednesdays are rehearsal days here at Family Guy and the first rehearsal with David Spade appears to be going very well. Uncle Ricky, what are all these strippers doing in our house? Uh... each other?
You know, now that I'm not tied down by the show, it's given me more time to pursue my true passion: weaving sexually explicit tapestries featuring the Minions.
Thursdays at Family Guy are reserved for shooting all those flashbacks and cutaway gags we love so much, and what most people don't know is that all these gags are directed by James Cameron.
You know, many viewers think our cutaways are just whipped together, but they actually go through a rigorous testing process before filming.
This is the planet Jew-piter, and he could say, Next year is my star mitzvah.
Okay, thank you, because, like, yes, I'm greased-up and, yes, I'm deaf, but what else am I?
I believe that's still seasonal, but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid, and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.
Now do you want to leave the regular way, or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?
Well, this seems like a really cheery place, and looks like some guy named Brooks was here, and I think this is gonna work out just great.
Of course I miss my family but everything comes to an end eventually, a-and you just... you just got to keep moving forward.
I-in fact, I was just about to melt some cheese on chips if you want to stay for a sad, single guy dinner.
Friday night is tape night here at Family Guy, but tonight they'll be filming the show without Peter Griffin.
I'm especially going to miss the Fat Man's bit with the audience where he fires the T-shirt cannon at his own head.
And with regard to Peter's replacement, well, as his parents and previous co-stars have learned, a little of David Spade goes a long way.
He has tiny hands but when one of my rings went down the drain, he got it right out.
Meanwhile, Peter has wound up here at the Chinese Theatre, where panhandlers dress up like iconic movie characters and charge tourists for photos.
I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin, but we have specific orders not to let you onto the lot.
Well, I suppose, you could come inside if you had an idea for a show the heads of the network wanted to buy.
Bumblr with a Tumblr eventually aired as Bamblr with a Famblr, which made sense to nobody and is now in its third season.
And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt of Kermit the Frog acting like a hip-hop guy.
I've been a real jerk... to you guys, and to all the union fat asses that I assume do something to keep this thing going.
The fact is, I got too big for my britches, but I know now that I'm nothing without all of you.
Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand, and if you guys can find it in your hearts to take me back, well, then I promise that every day I'll prove to you how much the show, and how much my family, means to me.
Oh, wait, if my character's still alive, that means we don't have a script to shoot.
We just happen to have a whole extra script right here. Pete, Don't Fail Me Now.
Oh, I have a goatee up till the first commercial, and then I'm a teacher.
Every week, Peter becomes a diva so the writers write a fake script, killing him off.
He storms out, then by Friday's taping, comes crawling back, and we shoot the real script.
Of course, he always forgets by Monday, and then he becomes a pain in the ass again.
So, I guess this actually was a very typical week on the set of Family Guy.
I'm James Woods, and we'll close tonight with a supercut of every time in the show's history that Peter got hit in the crotch with a bag of nickels.
Yeah, her husband just died of ALS, so she is ready to get at it.
I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go to the homecoming dance with me?
Probably 'cause everyone calls me names like Big Nips and Fat Nips and Big Fat Nips.
Oh, it's easy. You and I will just make a video about how sad you are and put it online.
If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone, just like you did on New Year's Eve.
All I need to know is: do you have a car, a phone and a face?
Stewie, I didn't want to do all that fancy stuff, so I just did a video of me speaking from the heart.
You know, telling her how much it would mean if a girl like her went to homecoming with a guy like me.
I just saw your video, and I'd love to go to your dance with you.
Our top story tonight, pop star Taylor Swift is coming to Quahog to attend a dance with local high-schooler Chris Griffin.
But first we go to commercial while our sports reporter smiles and spins a football for some reason.
Oh, Rupert, I can't believe Taylor Swift is actually going to be in our house.
I haven't been this excited since I abused those caffeine pills to get ready for the big show.
Quick question: in Shake It Off, you invite us to get down to, quote, this sick beat.
I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure, and you indicate when I should stop.
It was so nice to meet you all, except for the girl and the dog.
All right, we got our popcorn from home, our soda from home, our snacks from home and Braveheart.
I hope you don't mind I made the band pay me a royalty for each of my songs they played.
She even let me grab the part of her body which on others would be a butt.
She gets into relationship with guys, sabotages them, and then writes angry songs about it.
I ruin relationships with nice guys and John Mayer just so I can write songs about heartbreak and moving on.
Well, that'll be even cooler than when I was in that remake of The Princess Bride with Bill Cosby.
Now, one of these has the iocane powder, you see, and one of them makes you go sleepy-bye with your mouth open.
Of course, we were all husking corn back then just to keep the lights on.
Are you willing to risk losing them and jeopardize your career and your art just for us?
You pretend to relate to your fans, but you make your bodyguards carry your purse.
This next song is about my dumb ex-boyfriend, who either mistreated me, cheated on me or went to massage parlors when I was out of town.
No one will ever be close to as good as her, but we'll find you someone.
Well, kids, your father may have gotten beat up, but Uber's still a great job for anyone afraid to sell their blood.
I think we're all sorry about that, Brian, but I'm afraid we are out of time.
Didn't have time for him tonight, but let's see if we can get him back next week when Amanda Peet will be here with stand-up Dom Irrera.
Upon realizing a trip to Africa would be smelly and gross, our crew decided to stay in the office.
Yeah, see, if it was him, he would have said, Like I do every night: upside down.
Now, I don't have anything to control the trigger with, so I put it on a timer.
I need to live like a bat. So I got to be up at night.
Well, as everyone knows, bats watch a ton of Cinemax softcore porn, so that seems like the place to start.
But he went by the Prophet when times were good, or the Law Giver when times were bad.
I moved onto his prayer farm with 45 other members of the Salvation Star Boys, who died in a mass suicide.
Oh, but first, I'm required to have you read this pamphlet about the risks of vaccinations.
God, you are aging so rapidly. Possible side effects: fever, severe allergic reaction, muscle and joint pain?
Wait, and this can't be right: they actually put some of the disease in the shot?
But I don't remember having to read any of this when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.
We were going to get Stewie vaccinated, but now, after our research, we're definitely not.
The only reason they work is that if a critical mass of society gets immunized, then the diseases won't spread.
Look, Brian, I was skeptical, too, but then I did some research and I found some very interesting things from the leader of the anti-vaccination movement,
Don't you realize you're contributing to a potential public health disaster by not vaccinating your child?
Just as soon as I finish gettin' the word out about the one thing more important.
Very serious. Even the tiniest germ could make you very ill and, left untreated, kill you.
Although she did act like a nutcase that time she went shopping right before Thanksgiving.
Parents of Quahog and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch, do you know that the number of childhood vaccines has tripled in the last generation?
Because heartless corporations make billions of dollars by foisting garbage and poison upon our children.
We demand that these vaccines be tested by independent researchers, not by the companies who make them.
Hi, I'm a medical guy, and I'm here to give you the facts about vaccs.
Fact... Vaccinations cause autism, paralysis, and even... death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death.
Speaking of which, do you have any idea the germs you routinely track into this house?
Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog have dropped to an all-time low, fueled by a recent media campaign led by local meddler, Peter Griffin, shown here in the basket of Henry Thomas' bicycle.
Damn it, Peter, thanks to you, nobody in this town is vaccinating their kids anymore!
Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk, so I have jurisdiction over all of you.
Now, hold on, hold on, before we all freak out, it might just be full-body herpes.
I've got to get out of this house, or I'll be in worse shape than John Goodman!
So, yeah, last weekend, Sheila and I took the kids up to the lake, it was great.
So we're all there at the Clam, just kind of making music together, and then Peter, of course, had to join in and clap his hands, and I said, Eh, that's enough of that.
I hope my shoe doesn't fall to make me realize how far the drop is.
I hope you've realized that vaccinations are not a freedom of choice issue, they're a public health issue.
Thanks to them, countless serious diseases, mumps, polio, smallpox, and rubella, have been all but eradicated.
Well, I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy, and only 150 people died, but not anyone we knew personally.
Well, I actually drove my car into this rich guy's house, and he locked me in here until the police come.
Seems like he's on something. He's got crazy eyes and keeps screaming, I don't care.
Anyway, I've got some time to kill before this room is filled with tear gas, so I thought, Why not finally read some of the classics I never read in high school.
It was my first summer staying at the shore, but I had a feeling that I, Nick The Situation Carraway, would fit right in.
He was clearly playing with himself through his pocket, but I pretended not to see.
Um, I hate to break it to you, but that light you've been looking at is a gay gym called The Pump House.
You asked me down to the docks alone, and you're getting a funny vibe from me?
You know, one of the best parts of having an enormous mansion is being able to come out here and get some fresh air.
You know, sometimes I just want to jump off this balcony and into that pool down there.
I've been hearing about your vast newly acquired wealth and your attentions to my wife.
So I thought I would have you over to my equally large and fancy but imperceptibly more classy mansion for an awkward dinner.
I'm saying I invited you over and sat you next to my wife to say, Stay away from my wife!
Let's all drunk-drive into Manhattan and get a hotel room and have the same conversation we're having here.
I don't know what they do up there, but they sure do listen to Def Leppard pretty loud.
But I sure do enjoy driving your car instead of you driving it, even though we came in a different car.
You were standing earlier in the day next to the car that hit my wife.
I would soon return to New York a changed man, because, for me, that will always be the summer that I finally put my head underwater.
Only problem is, I really want to get to that trunk of costumes in the corner.
Hey, I'm your abusive dad, and I've been drinkin' all day from this here jug.
Lord, I'm-a tell ya, being a slave is a much worse job than the temp agency made it sound.
I believe we've been out here a long time, and a man's mind begins to play tricks on him.
But I wasn't gonna tell Huck, 'cause he claimed he didn't see me hook-shot that apple core into the garbage from way far away.
Well, while I'm being booked and processed downtown, we have time for one more classic of American literature.
We're going to open a bed-and-breakfast in the country, and we won't be afraid to let our guests know that we are Steelers fans in this house.
But we'll also have a sign in the front that says, Steelers fan parking only.
Like if they're Jets fans, we'll be all like, Okay, I hope you don't get towed.
Well, three of our guys did just get squished, so we just might. Come on in.
Have we pulled an object off a plant and placed it in a burlap bag?
Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies, and I thought, since you're covered with feces and I barely know you,
'cause I've already been killed twice in the other two stories, and I don't want...
But remember, if there's any trouble, we meet by the big tree on the edge of town.
All right, evidently I have to go to the big tree on the edge of town to take care of something.
I'm sorry, George, I didn't mean to kill the girl, and now the whole town's gonna hang me by a rope.
But while I do that, why don't you face away from me and count the stars.
All right, so the B&B will have a rack of single-gear bikes for every guest, and yes, next to that, of course, is going to be the big, giant rabbit hutch.
Are We Talking About Jake Gyllenhaal or Jared Leto? I am oily-haired with dinner-plate eyes. I was in that one movie about the weirdo. I somehow look both deathly ill and ripped. I am a less successful version of Tobey Maguire.
All right, now that I'm in charge of this brewery, there's gonna be some changes around here.
Effective immediately, you're the guy at the office with a weird ski tan, but you can't talk about it.
You got to constantly tell everybody what a good idea it is, and how important it is, and how wrong they are for having traditional desks.
Maybe it can just be my own personal choice, and-and I'm not judging others for their choices.
Oh, and three times a day you have to say, Sitting is the biggest killer in America.
But sir, if word got out about this, it'd be one of the most notorious developments in beer history, second only to Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach.
Also, some of the brewery workers say very hurtful things if a co-worker wears shorts.
Sir, an anonymous whistleblower in the brewery says you've personally ordered the sourcing of cut-rate, potentially toxic canning materials.
You ever been with a man who's got a prostate the size of a beefsteak tomato?
Yeah. I told her I was leaving her, and she freaked out for no reason.
But first, let's watch a safety video designed to terrorize you into being a responsible motorist.
And I'm impressed with reckless behavior, so I'm going to reward him with my mouth while he's driving.
Hey, careful. I'd hate for you to be unresponsive to my pleasuring while you're driving because of intoxication.
I'm a grizzled, seen-it-all veteran cop, and I'm shaking my head at the senseless waste.
Yup, food's on the table, and if anyone needs some dirty underpants, the vending machine's right over there.
I thought you were supposed to be doing a news story on Carter, not shacking up with him.
The truth is all I ever wanted was to some day have a family of my own.
Yes. A family just like this, in fact, with a fine son just like you, Peter.
A son to whom I could one day give a piece of sour plum candy.
Because, Chris, your idiot father thinks she's his new Tiger Mom, and he's trying to impress her.
On a wacky game show while a beautiful woman beats your scrotum with a reed.
Peter, another way to impress your Asian Tiger Mom is to put on this old-fashioned baseball hat and assist Indiana Jones on his next adventure.
Now, check your gauges with one eye while keeping your other eye on the road.
Well, you're going to think this is silly, but I love it when a man confesses to manufacturing improprieties.
I ordered the brewery to start making beer cans out of toxic, unsafe metal, just to save a few bucks.
I sleep with him to find out, though I'm fairly confident the answer is yes.
Of all the women I've institutionalized Babs over, she's the one who meant the most to me.
It's like, one day she's my Tiger Mom, and the next day she isn't, and the day before that first day, she also wasn't.
That's right, Tom. Tricia's recent exposé on the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery has been nominated for a local Emmy.
You and I will go to the local Emmys, and we'll embarrass Tricia on her big night in front of all her peers.
'Cause people need to know that she's an even bigger fraud than Robert Baden Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts.
Well, what if I said we'd both be wearing shorts and neckerchiefs, and I'd give him little patches for doing what I say?
He tried to Google it on his phone and ended up spilling hot coffee on his balls.
I took him to the ER and he said he'd pass me if I picked him up in an hour.
Maybe if one of us just chuckles for no apparent reason, everyone else will start chuckling.
Okay. All Tricia's got to do now is take one sip and she'll blow it out of all three holes, right here in front of everyone.
Maybe what she did to us was wrong, but sheesh, look what her own life has been like.
You know, I just been thinking, the way you and me fell so fast for this lady, and for no reason?
Hey, Stewie, seriously, thanks for everything you did to help me get my license back.
Too many pansy-ass parents sue the city when their kids sprain a finger or crush their skull on a bumper.
You can't do that! Last time I checked, this is still the United States of Tara.
Yeah, I know. It's just I got roped into going to some stupid office Christmas party with this girl I'm dating.
Really? I thought you just went to an office Christmas party with her last week.
Did you just say couch, but pronounce it strangely so it sounded like a name?
All right, look, I've been crashing office Christmas parties for the free booze and drunk women who don't want to spend the holidays alone.
Now, Chris, you're getting older, so it's time for you to learn the classic pool party game Talk to Somebody's Wife in a Bikini
Let's see what kind of Chinese pressed-board garbage we can get to replace my grandmother's priceless mahogany table.
And then I might just sit in that car in the middle of the mall and cry.
I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you, but it turns out the seasonal Santa we hired has a drinking problem.
Would you mind putting on the suit and playing Santa, just until the shift ends?
I followed you. I had to see for myself just how desperate and pathetic you really are.
And I want a tricycle and a pony and an American Girl doll and a drone with a camera and a gun that fires...
Well, the guy at the mall asked me to stay on till Christmas, and I said yes,
Yes, it's like watching a soap opera, what with all the drunken misbehavior and ill-advised hookups.
All right, now we're gonna go to your home and wait for you to pass it, and then you're gonna eat it again.
Unfortunately, since people only use printers now to print out boarding passes for their grandparents, be laid off as of Monday.
Mr. Redmayne, I don't know who you are, but I've been in charge of this office for 16 years...
I've been trying to reduce our staff costs for months, but just didn't have the guts to do it, much less before Christmas.
You can't go around in that suit pretending you're me and acting like a complete jackass.
So there's, like, no toilet on the sleigh, so you're, you're just, you're just crapping in people's houses, right?
You know, you're not talking to a little kid anymore, so get the hell out of my face, Santa.
So, Dad, now that you made Santa mad, aren't you scared he's gonna do something bad to you?
Well, you sent another text that says, Hey, Joe, it's definitely me, Peter, who sent the text.
I thought working in a cubicle at a mid-sized printing company would be the adventure of a lifetime.
You spread so much joy and wonder to kids everywhere, and I just used that to get stuff for myself.
But only after I screamed myself into a blackout while my whole family held me down.
Yeah, yeah, you cou... Yeah, yeah, you-you could also use the Mona Lisa as a placemat. God.
I had to fly to Aruba, so I brought my mom along with my friends and family discount.
Well, you know I have that fridge in the garage with bags of blood in my blood type?
I don't know, I-I guess I just figured you guys always have to work, or you're with your kids.
All right, the gay jokes are out of the way, now let's get down to business.
Okay, guys, this is the original Levi Jeans factory, created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853 so that gold miners could wear a comfortable yet durable fabric.
I was thinkin' we could tuck our shirts into our pants, put on huge helmets, and ride Segways.
Hey, I know we just met, but can I sit on your lap during your next post-game press conference?
This is exciting for the whole Bay Area, to be just four games away from the championship...
Normally I'd just go to Hudson News and pretend to be the most important guy there.
Oh, that's a voice filter, so the passengers always think the pilot is a 60-year-old Midwestern white man.
Short break? It looks like you had time to put together the 10,000-piece Lego Hogwarts.
I go inside, magically go back in time, and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.
Screw you guys. You know, being a pilot is hard work. Look, I tried to be nice and take you fellas on a free trip, and all you can do is crap all over my job.
No. I'm landing at the closest airfield, which is less than an hour away. So just let him go,
America needs to be punished for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.
Do you really want to know, or are you just asking because we're gonna be on a plane for a while and you think you should make small talk?
I know, now I wish I'd just stayed home and finished my remake of Inside Out.
Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s gets married without their dog being in the wedding.
Are you going to open this door, or am I going to start killing people?
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still the worst person on this plane.
There's over 150 passengers back there, several of whom are in our Commander's Club, and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.
If we can get to the galley, we can take the elevator down to the cargo hold.
You're right, it does. There's even an impatient businessman who really wants to reach his destination so he can conduct more business.
The search for a missing airliner continues, as speculation grows that the plane has been hijacked.
Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.
So, if I sign this, the war is over, we surrender, and we still get to be dicks forever?
And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan: crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,
You know, I've lost a ton in Vegas, but I never thought I'd lose my life there.
I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes, when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.
As you can see, I've taken off my blazer to show the severity of the situation.
They ask us to do that to cover up the sound of children playing nearby.
Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases in San Francisco, and I saw some things
Okay, once again, nothing is happening on Homeland, but over on Masters of Sex, Lizzie Caplan is hooked up to electrodes and getting it from a guy who sounds American, but probably isn't.
Hey, we're gonna split the screens now because my producer is telling me on Game of Thrones we got a malnourished Albino plowing a girl in a tub as he names dragons.
Last time we went to that, we lost a lot of subscribers, and we're keeping an eye on The Knick.
We don't want to bring you dead boobs, but if they're alive, we'll get you over there.
Eh, the airline's making us all attend a seminar about what do to if someone flies a drone into your flight path.
Yeah, I hear that kind of obnoxious behavior is very big right now in the dangerous idiot community.
Just a big article about how to tailgate a speeding fire truck to get places faster.
And most of them have cameras so people can spy on whoever they want and invade their privacy.
Yeah, I don't know what this is Peter, but we're four months behind on our mortgage.
Look, Stewie, I don't have time to sip air and pretend to eat a wooden hamburger patty.
Real tea, real milk, and the best honey you'll ever taste in your whole life.
All right, now, if you're going to sell honey at the farmers' market, you need to practice.
I simply came here to enquire about honey and your employee spoke to me loudly and with profanity.
No I'm just in town for the John Singer Sargent exhibit at the museum. Really?
Only the star tight end of the New England Patriots and America's most athletic Polish.
I wanted to bring over something to welcome Gronk to the neighborhood. So I scraped all the cool ranch off of 15 bags of Doritos.
Yeah, I thought he could eat it by the fistful or rub it on his balls.
I'm gonna lay down these work blueprints on the floor and I sure hope you don't walk across them with muddy paws.
Workout room, kegerator cellar, another workout room, and over here's a room that's just got a lit candle on a bale of hay.
And the pool is filled with my favorite food: soup with little shapes in it.
You've got your yoga pants moms, you got your mixed-race kids riding a pony, a confused Jerome...
Wow, this is great, we've only been here an hour and we're almost totally sold out.
When you know you have single coverage, do you give a hand signal to Brady, or is it just eye contact?
Well, no, I ask because sometimes you're being covered by a little guy, and then you and Brady'll look at each other and...
God bless her, but genetically, they're a product of me blammin' onto a side of beef.
All right, since we sold out so fast, we've got to make these bees more productive, get them to make more honey.
This here is the same stuff that turned Barry Bonds' head into a prize-winning squash.
Well, you can't fit a horse in this box, so I'd just use the whole thing.
I know. That guy's more annoying than going to an Italian restaurant with someone who's been to Italy.
Gronk went to the University of Arizona, and everyone who went to the University of Arizona believes leprechauns are real.
You're a millionaire, you have the sweetest job in the world, you can do whatever you want.
Yeah, now maybe Wilson can move back in and give me homespun wisdom over the fence.
Rob Gronkowski has been suspended from the Patriots following a failed drug test that showed evidence of steroids in his system.
The star athlete claims he has no idea how the banned substance got into his body.
Hey, you know what, guys? This right here, this rambling, boring conversation containing already-made-before observations, this could be a podcast.
Really? A podcast? Don't you have to be some sort of whiz kid to do those?
I'm gonna go take a shower so I can blow my nose into my hands.
We got the equipment and the perfect business plan... give our show away for free, and tell no one how to find it.
When you want something expensive thrown on your porch and stolen, you want the U.S. Postal Service.
Anyway, my brother Louie, he's a... he's a little off to the side, you know?
All right, tell you what I'd do, I'd back into a bathroom stall, and just start kickin'. Dead! Dead! Dead!
Keep comin'! Dead! Give 'em a narrow entry point, make 'em come in single file.
Look... I even brought Tom Sizemore's Game of Life. Sell rights to Saving Private Ryan residuals to buy a case of Coors Light. Steal your son's wallet while he's in the shower. Miss audition. Scoop someone's urine from Starbucks toilet to pass drug test.
Someone gave me a pill, and now all I want to do is feel your jacket.
Peter, I was plowing this college chick last night, and I saw this flyer on her mini fridge.
I carried you as long as I could, but Rob Kardashian's gonna be at this thing, so I got to be at my best.
We've always had each other's backs, like when we used to rob banks in lesser-known presidents masks.
You've got to stop coming home so late if you can't get up in the morning, and...
Oh, no. That's just from riding here in a hot car, but Dr. Hartman, what about his hearing?
This must be because of all that loud, blaring music he's been playing in those nightclubs.
What's going on? Can he fix it in time for me to deejay at the music festival?
You told us you were a big shot deejay and didn't want anything to do with us.
I wanted to tell you that you can come back and sleep in our room.
He stuffed all our pillows with hay because he thought it looked comfortable in cartoons.
Audible dot com presents, Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea, as read by Chelsea Handler.
Oh, yeah. Turns out it wasn't the loud music at the clubs that made me go deaf.
I just appreciate that you guys were there for me and tried to help me out.
Ugh. This is gonna suck. are either air guitar or girls dancing to songs from Frozen.
Yeah, back in my day you had to be a triple threat to even get on that stage.
I could sing, dance, and guess the weight of any baby that was tossed to me.
Wake up, people, Monsanto is poisoning the world with frankenfoods, and we're letting it happen.
And now, two football players are going to do something that only makes sense to the rest of the football team.
Now, Mr. Pewterschmidt, your vision will be impaired for a few weeks while you recover.
I recommend you and your wife have someone around to help you during this time.
You'll be a hero... Just like King Arthur when he pulled the sword from the stone.
Yeah, no offense, Muchacho, but I don't know if I have time for that, Muchacho.
I did play the Oboe in high school, and the girls wouldn't leave me alone.
I'm done with my bath. Put on this lady wig and help me out of the tub.
And that's not all... I also use it to throw boxes of frogs down on that church.
Ãtienne will whip you up an egg dish with some shallots and chanterelles or whatever's fresh.
I'm sure this is a step down for you, Bri, but now you're back in the real world
Oh, and they also taught me that if your hand is bigger than your face, you have cancer,
But if you're upset about the guys kicking you out of the group, you can't really blame them.
And if you work at it and get a little better, they'll see you care about them.
Listen, Peter, we know you've been working hard on the violin, but more importantly, you're our pal,
I did this, and it's made me realize that I was blinded by luxury and comfort,
That's right, Tom. Medieval Castle, which has been a staple of family entertainment and dining, is closing its doors.
Yes, hard to believe a place where you eat with your hands next to piles of horse dung while untrained theater students fight with real swords could be drowning in lawsuits.
I must have jacked it up playing sports and not trying to dance like Beyoncé.
Then she'll drive me to the doctor, and I hate being in the car with her.
Due to the presence of black mold, discarded half-eaten turkey legs, and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach,
Do I hear an opening bid for this majestic fiberglass castle facade, masking what was once a Midas Muffler shop?
Two bits and a cardboard box, which may or may not contain a mystery bag.
Due to my 12:00 noon court appointment as part of a crippling child-custody battle with my horrific ex-wife,
I would call my sister about this if she were able to answer the phone.
I'm saying the four of us should storm that castle and take it for ourselves.
Should we do it with careful planning, or have another couple beers and then just go for it?
I checked with my mom, and she said it was cool with her if we wanted to sleep here tonight.
I've been in this location for 40 years, and never once have I broken a lamp.
So should I be aiming for an open window, or just arcing it over the wall?
All right, this says if we don't get arrested for the next six months, the arson and mayhem charges will be dropped.
It's an app for your phone where two strangers can hook up for a dirty liaison.
Oh, yeah, I've been working on that. I wrote several long paragraphs describing my interests, some pet peeves, choice of wine, a couple of inspirational quotes, things I've learned from my cats...
You want a naked bathroom selfie covering your stuff with a fistful of $100 bills.
Okay, it says Hey, and then a kissy face, and then, like, a saucy, smirking face, three balloons, and a locomotive.
I'm just gonna nudge it with my knee into this empty pizza box... and it's stuck to my knee.
All right, we got to just throw that phone away and end this once and for all.
Yeah, there's plenty of nice women out in the real world to meet the old-fashioned way.
Yes, is it possible to get Showtime for free for the next, like, two hours to see if I like it?
No. Look, I'm not trying to pick you up, it just seemed like you were upset about something, and I know when I'm upset, it's nice to let someone else in.
Give up on your attempt to convince real Quagmire to not use Tinder, and to instead have sex with this woman who's right in front of him.
I'm just saying, you used to have skills that no one else had, that took you years to hone.
And all it took was for us to hire that $200 dirty prostitute to pretend to be a nice lady in a bar.
I'm just glad she's a prostitute and not that lady murderer that's been all over the news.
Every second I'm not having sex with a housekeeper, robots are killing people in the future.
You used to be this badass cop out there on the street, busting heads and keeping us safe.
I go through all the body cam footage and take out all the parts where the cops go pee-pee.
Eh, not erasing, sort of cutting them together into a funny montage we show on birthdays.
Man, you guys think Joe's as happy as he says he is, just doing all that desk work?
I don't know, maybe she saw you try to throw that feather in the yard yesterday.
Hey, since we're in a cop car, let's talk about our hunches and how something doesn't add up.
No can do, I got to go to the station and tidy up the bulletin board.
Come on, Stewie, are you still hung up about that woman at the grocery store thinking you were a girl?
That's weird phrasing, but I'll tell you this, Swanson, you keep up this kind of work, there'll be no more grocery runs for you.
You know, I was just thinking about how much fun we had the other day, and wondered if you'd want to join me for another ride-along.
Hey, and-and can we go slow up to a homeless guy and go joop-joop and see what he does?
Our top story tonight: local news anchor too professional to laugh at penis poked through hole in cue card.
But first, earlier today at city hall, the mayor honored a hero cop who has foiled a string of recent crimes.
Good afternoon, we had a budget meeting that ran long, so I'm gonna eat my lunch while I hold this press conference.
Okay, while the dressing does its magic, let's honor Officer Joe Swanson, who single-handedly cut crime in Quahog by 75%.
I mean, he can come out for limp handshakes at the end of the game, but I can't play him. He's too little. Little?
Officer Swanson, as you requested, here's a big stack of all the cases you cracked.
Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead and brood over a photo of the girl whose case was the one I couldn't solve.
Oh, I see. You need me to be the bad cop who kicks all the ass and then I'm supposed to be quiet about it?
Yeah? Well, maybe I accidentally reveal that you're not the hero everyone thinks you are and that you've been letting your neighbor do all kinds of cop stuff.
I'll tell you why. You're getting all the credit for my police work, so I want stuff from you.
Well, unless you'd rather I spill the beans to the chief about who's been doing your dirty work.
Actually, I already receive The New York Times, and I always enjoy finishing the crossword puzzle.
Well, on TV if somebody gets hit on the head, you hit them a second time and that gets them back to normal.
You see, what a concussion is is the impact of brain matter on the inside of the skull.
That's why you sometimes hear this nonsense about, Oh, let's just give them better helmets.
You've been getting all those commendations and my online handmade lip balm business is really taking off.
Well, uh, maybe you and I could do one last bust for old time's sake.
I just have to accept that I'm not a man and I'm never going to be one.
That's ridiculous. You can't let what one woman says in a grocery store define who you are.
Recent brain scan studies have shown that brain injuries are directly linked to dementia and suicides in former players!
Wow. I guess I just got ground down by years of people treating me like an errand boy, and I just let them walk all over me.
You know, you were a real pain in the butt as a partner, but you helped me find myself again.
Excuse me, do you have any Tab soda I can bring back to the sex dungeon where I've been held captive for decades?
Well, if you like movies in HD, then frozen pixels, then HD again, the answer is yes.
And if you love the golden year of movies, 2003, then we might have some of what you're looking for.
Netflix Streaming: buffer for 20 minutes, then watch 35 minutes of a movie with Jason Statham.
That's www dot, the word double-u three times, the word dot, PBS, the word dot again, the word com, dot com.
I went to Whole Foods today and got this recipe from an extremely thin man with a giant Adam's apple.
No problem. And I'm gonna take some pictures of the other athletes, if you don't mind.
You might not know this about me, but I am a bit of a shutterbug.
Okay, now, last year we were tricked by a couch on a dolly with wheels, so if any of you is a couch on a dolly with wheels,
Well, we need five for a team and there's five of you here, so congratulations.
We watched Tyler Perry's Food Kills, which is the same movie except it stars black folks you've never heard of and white folks you don't hear from anymore.
Whoops, I stopped thinking about math and started thinking about baby-man Billy Corgan being sad at Disneyland.
This, Lois, is my new food truck, specializing in all the delicious, unhealthy foods that you won't let me eat.
'Cause you don't let me eat what I want to eat and that... and, uh, I am super dizzy and there might be a gas leak in this thing.
Look, I'm happy for the business, but drinking that on your knees is... it's putting a hat on a hat.
I mean, you can eat sprouts and vegan crap your entire life and still get devoured by Gremlins and-and-and none of it matters.
So you're saying you shouldn't take care of yourself because you might get devoured by Gremlins?
Me? I like to squeeze the can so hard the chili flies into my mouth like Popeye.
You got it. Let me put on my bandana, fire up my very loud what generator, and get cooking.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first bout of the season, the Quahog Thugs versus the Medford Dump Cakes.
This season we're brought to you by Barry's Note Cards. When you need to remind yourself of the sponsor, use Barry's Note Cards.
Wow, newcomer Meg Griffin is lighting up the track with some amazing moves. Amazing? Damn right, amazing.
And just sign by dragging your bare finger across this thing I use to masturbate.
'Cause I watched how rough it was out there the other day, and I got a little worried for you.
Yeah, I got it, Stewie, but I'm telling you, Meg, something bad is going to happen.
You kids get in the house and eat the healthy dinner I prepared, and Peter, you, too.
And I'm not going back in that house and listen to Lois tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.
I don't think so. I'm hurt pretty bad, like that time I was running with scissors.
Here you go. And if you'd like to put your e-mail on our sign-up list,
We said we're gonna stand in our front yards and wave as it goes by so we're on the street view.
I finally felt like I was good at something, I made friends... but seeing you like this, I realize you were right.
Now get back to that rink and help your team win the championship it deserves.
I think she did all right, but no one will know for sure because halfway through everyone stopped to watch some fat kid who was killing it on Dance Dance Revolution.
Tom, I'm standing here outside a Spooner Street home, where a local business owner has apparently eaten himself into his own food truck.
Yeah, it's every girl's dream to have her husband hoisted out of a food truck in a horse harness.
I'm a big tub of lard, and you have every reason to be ashamed of me.
I only wanted you to eat healthy because I love you, and I'm concerned about your health.
I guess I could do without eating so much junk, but I could never do without you.
Peter had steamed vegetables and brown rice that evening, then ate like crap for the rest of his life.
Oh, yeah, the winner and a friend get to hang out and practice with retired Red Sox players and then play in a real game, right on the field at Fenway.
So I was just baking a coffee cake, and I figured I'd bring it over,
Guys, look, I know you all want to go, but I-i need a little more time to figure this out.
Whichever one of them you bring to Fenway, the other two will be mad at you.
I-I'm going for shopping, the hotel spa, and two days of being away from you life-sucking turds.
Okay, now you heard mom say I'm in charge, so I just want to lay a few ground rules. Yeah.
You want to hand me some cash in front of the other men so you feel powerful?
Now let me put this baby bonnet on his head and a cigar in his mouth.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go lick the foot of a fleshy, pale woman for real sex 34.
Rupert, what do you think of this fan fiction I wrote? Diego pressed Dora against the wall, her bosom heaving, her hot Latina breath on his face.
I take abuse from everybody around here, but I am not gonna take it from you.
All right, that's it, I'm not just gonna sit here and see what that psycho does next.
I shall fashion a makeshift ladder with my diaper genie entrails, shimmy down to the yard, and I'm free.
We've been saving a spot at the head table for you with all the hall-of-famers.
This is the one night of the year they let me out of the scoreboard.
You're the only one here who doesn't have a fistful of baseball cards for us to sign.
Now, come on, Lois, we've got you sitting right between Pedro Martinez and Ted Williams' severed head.
There's a special place in hell for whoever's responsible for me ending up like this.
Okay, Lois, catch the ball, and if your foot comes off the bag, just tag Peter on any part of his body.
It's supposed to be a fun day out here, and you go nuts and break your wife's leg.
Like those poor guys who had to come up with a new ad campaign for subway.
You know what I'm getting sick of saying? My husband did this to me, but it's not what you think.
And I was excited that for one weekend, if I could just step on that field and get a hit at Fenway park,
I could erase all that and feel like a champ for the first time in my life.
Either you play, or every one of these Red Sox are going to jail... even Ted Williams.
Yeah, I'm thinking about pulling the trigger, but they make you sign, like, a two-year...
Uh, your father broke my leg out of jealousy, but that didn't ruin our honeymoon, and it's not gonna ruin this.
So listen, I want all you guys to drive up to Boston this afternoon to see your father play in the big game.
Who, Meg? - Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean, and I don't ever want her to be in charge of me.
'cause I was too embarrassed to get nude in the locker room, so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.
Well, I'm sorry, I got no choice but to call for a complete muscle failure.
I ran like a champion that day, pushing through the pain of two torn hamstrings and a ruptured groin, to leg out the hit at Fenway park
But nobody noticed, 'cause the account manager from B of a who was playing third base had a massive coronary trying to field my crappy little nubber.
The hit was amazing, but what made it even better was that my family was there to share the moment with me.
Every kid in school had to write a list of five reasons Principal Shepherd is cool and then have their parents sign it.
One time, I saw him pee in a urinal with his hands on his hips.
James Woods High will be hosting a cross-country meet, which also happens to be where Lorraine has threatened to take my children, across the country.
All right, finally some peace and quiet, so I can buckle down and get some writing done.
Just do it! Just say, It's all been a pack of lies. It's all been a pack of lies.
And then, the next night, he invited the watching guy to be in the front row of his concert so he could sing it right to him and they could arrest the guy!
Well, I'm trying to work on a sequel to The Old Man and the Sea.
Oh, yeah, that's what Hemingway used to complain about. This Spanish Civil War is just too loud.
No, I mean, it might sound silly, but I used to daydream that by now
I'd have my own place by a lake somewhere, an oasis where I could go to write.
Students, faculty and staff of James Woods High, does anyone know how to push down the backseat of a Highlander?
I just listened to two hours of butt-dialed sex between my wife and the ADT alarm guy.
Well, we don't have a boiler, but I can't wait to see what you've done in the cellar.
Oh, also, please rub the H and the C off all the knobs, so people won't know what the hell's going on.
Let's call to order this emergency meeting of the school board regarding Principal Shepherd's meltdown.
I know a number of our students have felt traumatized by the events of this week, and we take those concerns very seriously.
Therefore, the board is seeking a parent volunteer to serve as interim principal until a permanent replacement can be found.
Hey, Lois, maybe I should do it. I've always wanted a job where I can let my dandruff go wild.
Yeah, no offense, Peter, but I don't know if you should be running a school.
Oh, your father says he doesn't need it anymore now that he's a high school principal.
As a principal, I like to start each morning with a reference from last century.
Wait, I'm sorry, weren't you just here a moment ago with a different man... oh, crap.
Stewie, we have a problem. The only people checking in are here to have sex with prostitutes.
Well, then why are they all signing the guest book and writing quaint things like, Railed Crystal good. Oh...
You see, if our guests insist on bringing prostitutes into our B and B, we might as well provide the women, too.
I'm sure. The answer is no, so don't bother flashing a wad of money, because there's no way I'm gonna change my answer in the middle of this sentence...
This is gonna make people's sneakers sticky, and then we're gonna have to listen to... all day!
Yeah, Meg, now that your dad's the principal, you could finally have power over the bullies.
Yeah. In fact, if you're gonna lead this school, you've got to know that kids need discipline.
There's gonna be some changes around here, and what better way to show you I'm serious than to smash a desk with a baseball bat?
The four of us got together last night, and we came up with a list of 11 students and two teachers that you need to do something about.
He wouldn't kiss Ruth at the Sadie Hawkins dance, even though she bought him dinner before at Walt's Roast Beef.
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this as gently as I can, but it appears that someone's rectum fell out on the stairs.
But let's just agree on a rule that if your rectum falls out on the stairs, it's on you to pick it up.
This is a hell of a lot easier than when I delivered pizza in New Orleans.
Huh. Well, I got to admit I was skeptical, but it sounds like things are going pretty well down there.
Uh, he's just saying he wants to use his key to drive me to school tomorrow in his car.
We just realized we can keep all the money, take your house, and kill you if you try to do anything about it.
Hello, I'd like to report a brothel operating on Route 6, near Round Hill Road.
You want to eat mangled raisin bread across the street and watch the cops raid the place?
Jeff Banfield, I'd like you to please come down here, take your pants off and sit.
Yes, but then I went on a sex trip to Thailand, and I banged all the goofy right out of me.
Listen, my aunt is waiting for me, but it was nice to meet you, Chris.
Also, I was wondering if there's any chance you'd maybe want to go out with me sometime.
Oh, Chris, that's sweet, but I don't think you'd want to go out with me.
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
You are? Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say...
Uh, are you sure you want to date a girl who's... had so much experience?
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
But don't worry, I'm planning on getting back into the country as soon as I can.
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
Lois, if you do that, Chris will resent you for the rest of his life.
Trust me, one day of watching those kids, and he'll want them out of here.
All right, guys, nothing but the best for you two, so I got you all-organic, non-GMO, no-hormone food.
Looks like we're gonna go to Jersey Mike's and hope that future science will save us.
Well, now-now hold on, Lois, hold on, maybe Chris getting a job's not the worst idea.
Ashley, go ahead, pick an answer, find a question, spin the table, and remember, the clock is ticking backwards.
If Isabella can't get here to take her kids back, we'll just have to bring them to her.
I mean we're going to Mexico so we can give these kids back to their mother.
Look, Isabella, you shouldn't be separated from your children, so we've brought them to you.
But as a mom, I don't know if I can in good conscience leave this family here.
All you got to do is say dyed black eyebrows into the wind, and he appears.
Mrs. Griffin, you would take the risk of smuggling me and my children across the border?
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
Up till now, the only thing he could take care of was my traffic tickets.
You know, I just wanted to do the right thing, but now we're all gonna die.
I was wrong to say you couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of two kids.
And if you want to continue to date her and be a part of those kids' lives,
You know how many times I had you kids in the oven, just daring myself to turn it on?
With just a few clicks, you'll be able to send someone 14 pounds of unwanted decorative produce that will go bad within an hour of arrival!
Order now and make someone feel guilty about throwing it straight into the trash six hours later.
How would you find out the name of the actual actress who plays the AT&T chick?
Well, my last name helps keep a roof over our head and pays for your hobby.
I mean, what would our husbands do if they had to change their own diapers?
And we'll give you $500 if you can sing Britney Spears' I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.
If this is the fracking people, I have made it clear that I am 100% on board.
You've never met me before and probably don't even know I exist, but you're my father.
Like when he was an NFL announcer and had to pretend he cared about the shows after the game.
Tonight, Madam Secretary faces an international crisis in Pakistan, while her teenage daughter faces her own crisis finding a date for the prom.
Nope. So, hey, uh, are you tipsy enough to let me have lazy Tony Soprano sex?
You know, where-where I just lie there and arch my hips a little bit and breathe like a dying whale?
All right, well, just in case, I'll be upstairs getting into my boxers and black socks.
I don't know, but something's going on, because I'm telling you, he lied right to my face.
Yeah, I'd-I'd almost forgotten about it, but then last night, I get this call from a woman who says she's my daughter.
I'm sorry I tricked you, but if you do have a child out there, isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?
Wherever someone has a banner for a football team as a curtain, I'll be there.
Yeah, I hope you don't mind the drop-in, but the, uh, the sperm bank said it was okay to contact you.
Only once, but I had just seen Uma Thurman in Beautiful Girls, so it was kind of a ka-blamo.
Uh, listen, I want all of you to know how happy we are to meet you.
Just 'cause they're my kids and they all look like me doesn't mean we have anything in common.
For years, I have dreamed of one day traveling from Bavaria to play the accordion for my birth family.
You always say that, and I'm the one who ends up feeding him and walking him and doing all the clean up.
You're the first person who looks anything like my husband who's offered to help in any way.
I got to tell you, it's so strange, you look so much like Peter when I first met him.
Anyway, we didn't really get a chance to finish our conversation yesterday, and I thought maybe we could grab some lunch together.
All right, everybody bring your phones so we can text each other during the movie.
I don't know, he's just so sweet and fun-loving, and for God's sake, he looks just like Peter did when he was his age.
Look, I feel awful about it, but I told Larry that was it, and we couldn't be anything more than friends.
Yeah, I-I'm fine, I just hurt my neck this morning vigorously nodding approval to Judge Judy.
No, no, I meant I was holding my own nuts so he wouldn't kick them.
I guess Larry just reminded me of a younger version of you, and the truth is,
I liked that he was paying me a little attention, the way you used to.
Maybe I have been taking you for granted, but I promise I'll make it up to you.
For God's sakes, when push came to shove, you stood toe-to-toe with a much younger man and fought for me.
Oh, hey, by the way, uh, thanks, all my kids, for stepping in to help.
At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back. Afraid? I love doing that.
From now on, I'm making sure my sperm stays right where it belongs: in the bathroom sink.
Family Guy has been around since 1999 and whenever it's time for the Emmys, they don't give us one.
Yeah. Simpsons plays down to competition. Simpsons step into the sewer. Shame on you, Simpsons.
Boy, the, uh, the ethnic characters on these Emmy-winning shows aren't exactly rocket scientists, are they?
I've made plans to undergo surgery so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.
I think gender-reassignment surgery is very brave and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.
Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual Lily on Modern Family.
I'm now confident enough to share my truth with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son, Chris.
And if being a woman makes you happy, then in the words of Mr. Spock, It's only logical.
Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough that you were able to get me to do this.
I mean, shows like Nurse Jackie are basically dramas, but they get comedy awards all the time.
That's how we'll win the Emmy with dark, confusing plot twists like on Homeland or Mad Men.
It's basically four minutes of nonsense on at 1:00 in the morning breaking up personal injury ads.
We have to pay for Chris's doctor bills and meds for our daughter in the CIA.
How are we ever gonna pay all these bills that have been perfectly ripped across the top so the words past due are visible?
Oh, I just thank God there's no devastating turn of events going on that I don't know about.
I'm going to gradually talk quieter, as if I'm growing distant to show how overwhelmed you are by this news.
No. I need money for sympathetic reasons and I have no other option than crime.
When it comes to selling drugs, you and me will be a better team than the old lady's eyeballs on Downton Abbey.
You got to kill a kid at least once a season to make people go, Oh, I can't believe they killed a kid.
That was badass how it went from the guy burning up to the barbecue, right? Best Director.
Kevin Spacey always said, I was just walkin' my dog in that park at 3:00 a.m.
'cause the doctor said I had the cancer... and I killed the guys, and Joe took all the mon... the money!
Now take off all your clothes so we don't get blood on 'em... when we kill that cop in the desert.
Like all television viewers, our first priority before deciding to continue watching a show should be whether or not it features enough diversity.
Would you mind reading it out loud for maximum old-timey effect? To P. Griffin, from the Emmy Board of Governors.
And then I send the demo tape to producers, and if they like you, they're gonna hire you.
All right, now, a lot of these scenes are gonna be you interacting with someone else, so I'll just come around and read with you.
And there you have it, Family Guy reaches a new low as it grovels and begs for a meaningless award.
I would say they've got about as much chance of winning an Emmy as the Republican Party has of accomplishing something.
Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons: first, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch, and second, to tell you that
To convey this moment of shock at the depth of the conspiracy around me, here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie Tough Guys Don't Dance.
It's like there's some kind of secret society that takes all the awards and is keepin' us from getting one.
You can't take a scene from Ferris Bueller, cross out the name Ferris, and replace it with Peter.
And worst of all, you take this big pile of garbage, and you tie it all up by having everyone sit around saying, At least everything's back to normal, as if something happened.
Well, I'm glad all this Emmy nonsense is over and things are back to normal.
You know, I may not get Emmys, but I do get the best award of all... My family.
And this e-mail from a young fan. Dear sir, your show helped me when I was going through chemotherapy.
Ugh. You know, later we're going to have to take one of those forced happiness family photos that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.
We haven't done anything as a family since we sat courtside at that NBA game.
I feel more relaxed than a chick on Facebook with her legs in front of a pool.
Nothing. After the other night, I made a decision: from now on, I'm only using women's restrooms.
I'll just ask them for something so ridiculous, they'll have to check in the back for it.
How about a telephone that's made of vintage phone book paper and doesn't make or receive phone calls or work in any way?
There's nothing you can possibly imagine that's strange or useless enough that we don't have it here at Anthropologie.
Okay, Stewie, you're gonna help Daddy by holding his iPad while he watches season one of House of Cards.
Ah, that's just a silly title they gave me down at the Karate Paintball Dirt Bike Club.
I always had this crazy dream that one day I'd run into the guy with the other half.
Like, he's one of those guys whose forearm hair makes his watch look even cooler.
Okay, just, uh, just give me a second so I can put away all my guitars.
I know. I haven't seen him this giddy since he discovered that single-loop roller coaster.
Like the guys in my photography club. Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones and Jared from Subway,
One time, I jumped off a top bunk with a towel around my neck like a cape.
Hey, can I show you seven or eight things on my body and ask for medical diagnosises?
Hey, look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed by us and you think we're losers, well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either.
Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something, I go all the way, like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.
Maybe you jump off this cliff and I spin around over there and sing Sound of Music.
I can see you're a little nervous, Peter, but I'm telling you, it is easier than you think.
And I just know I'm gonna be the one to have to identify the body.
You can't just treat us like garbage and then expect us to take you back like nothing happened.
I know it's got to be hard to watch a man explode like a bug on a windshield.
They're really mad at me, and I'm-I'm afraid they don't want to be friends with me anymore.
It's just, when I hung around with Stryker, people thought I was cool, and it-it felt good.
I don't know, Peter, but it's got to be something really meaningful, because imagine how they feel.
Lois told me to go jump off a cliff to prove my friendship to the guys.
It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm about to thread the needle to prove to you guys how sorry I am and that I'd do anything to win you back.
And if something goes wrong and I don't survive, you can go ahead and delete the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.
Not all of us believe that, but we took a vote and I agreed I'd respect the majority.
Look, you really treated us badly, but the fact that you'd be willing to literally risk your life just to show us how much you care, well, that says a lot.
If being cool means don't get to hang out with you guys, then I don't ever want to be cool.
Hey, this is a really weird question, but do you boys want to go out dancing?
So obviously he bought a herd of goats, and now they've taken over the house.
Stewie was last seen with a goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel heading north on I-95.
Well, I guess it would be good to have some help with Meg and Chris.
Under parody law, in order to use someone else's character in an unlicensed fashion, we have to provide something called commentary.
Okay, Stewie, this is favorite Belarusian children book called Goodnight Moon of Chernobyl. Goodnight Chernobyl moon.
Eh, it could be fun. And we haven't been on a date since I broke the Guinness record for longest nasal exhale at that Tina Fey movie.
It is actually funny. At least three times an episode we turn to each other and we say, That's just like us!
You know, Donna told me in the bathroom she and Cleveland haven't had sex in over three months.
I want to lean over this half-eaten blueberry pie and kiss you with black coffee breath.
You come in late last night drunk and tell me to pack car for weekend getaway you book online.
Then you make me watch Diff'rent Strokes episode with substitute teacher played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
That-That's what any guy wants, the same gal again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, and again.
And every gal wants the same guy who keeps getting fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter...
Oh, you didn't hear? Today is the opening of the first-ever Spooner Street Farmers Market.
Oh, look at this cute note. In lieu of television, please tune in to each other.
Ha-ha, indeed. And get this. Sorry no Wi-Fi, but the good news is your marriage has four bars.
So, do you think word just got out in the daddy longlegs community, like, Hey, come to this hotel?
Hey, will you let me know when you're done using the phone charger that I brought?
Really? Let's go knock on the door of the next room and ask them which one of us is fat.
You think you're the only one in this relationship who wants to be with a successful man?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, arrow.
Sorry, Cleveland, he wanted a surprise party and this is how he thinks it works.
Thank you, I will take that and give you a spoon 'cause you're a dumb baby.
Peter The Riff Griff, shockin' ya and rockin' ya while I'm sittin' here talkin' to ya.
It's 75 and sunny, which means our Street Squad's gonna be out looking for them Super Stickers.
If you don't got one, get down to Linoleum Depot this Saturday from 9:00 to 2:00.
Now, I'm looking around and I'm seeing the Spin Doctors with not one, but Two Princes.
Well, there's this game where you try to toss a penny into a shot glass.
Yeah. I stole it from a dry cleaner who refused to put my picture up.
Since you are my girlfriend and are hot, will you marry me so that I can bone you?
As long as you can always throw a Nerf football over my truck with your strong arm.
I was wondering if you'd let me take you out for a feast of Indian food, followed by some blow-off-to-the-side curry burps?
Hey, I came by to bring you a frame for that birthday dollar I gave you.
Benjamin Franklin and Washington are both on the front, posing back-to-back like an '80s sitcom.
All right, Chris, if we're going to find that misprint dollar, we have to retrace your steps.
Well, first I drank a Four Loko, and then I rode my bike down to the hair salon and shouted Nope! at all the women who came out.
All right, this is where we can buy those pills to get you off the sauce.
I got to do laundry so I can stop hanging out in my underwear with a bunch of guys.
But if I close my eyes, you'll all disappear and I'm a-scared of being alone.
Excuse me, sir, would you like to buy some candy to send Jewish kids to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?
Our date? But I thought you got rid of the dollar with my number on it.
Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass, so get your pants off and put a towel on the kitchen table!
Anyone who doesn't want to see my big, white, flailing butt, get the hell out.
Ah, well, some dildo wrote his phone number on it, so now it's worth jack!
You know, when it comes to making dreams come alive, there used to be nothing like the movies.
So we thought it would be fun to ask a few visionary Hollywood directors to create his...
Of the countless directors we contacted, three did not say no immediately, and I got a weird message from Paul Verhoeven that I could not understand.
Well, you're not really ready, but if it's for revenge, you can stab me with this scalpel
Peter, I'm standing here because I am the only Asian recurring character on the series.
Welcome back to our special episode, featuring famous directors' versions of the same Family Guy story, Peter Gets Fired.
I'm still here in front of the Hollywood Sign, but I've asked the cameraman to adjust the shot so that you can only see wood.
Anyway, our next director is Wes Anderson, a guy who makes you feel like you ate a pot brownie and woke up in a greeting card.
On a March day, with a temperature of 64 degrees, my father lost his position with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company, near our village in central Quahogia.
With no discernible reaction, my father made his way home to deliver the news to my mother.
We lived in a New England cottage that was inside a vintage Army tent, that was inside a decommissioned submarine, that was all inside an old airplane hangar.
My brother Chris had spent his life conjoining his twin loves, medicine and escape artistry.
I've summoned you all and arranged you in a perfectly symmetrical form in front of me to tell you some important news.
On an overcast Thursday afternoon, my father presented his play, one of the most compelling stories of the 1980s,
My father passed away in the spring of his 43rd year, and was put to rest in the family graveyard.
On this very spot, 52 years ago, a piece of beef jerky was planted in the ground and watered with Red Bull.
The Decepticons plan to destroy the Seven Wonders of the World, starting with the Hagia Sophia.
If we could find someone strong enough to throw a keg with enough force, we might have a shot.
The only problem is, there's not a man alive who can throw a keg with that kind of force.
According to our sources, the search is underway for a man strong enough to throw a keg with enough force to save the Seven Wonders of the World.
Look, Peter, I didn't want to ask you to do this because of that maverick but awesome thing you did in the battle war of the past.
He went rogue and saved everyone's lives, but he didn't do it by the book.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go change my mind in the shower.
Deal. Now let me sit sideways on your motorcycle like a Vietnamese woman, and let's get out of here.
Two months is a long time when you don't sleep and only eat ground beef.
Let's have a fight with so many quick shots and close-ups, you can't tell what's going on.
I never got to repeat to him the line he said to me earlier in the film that has taken on new meaning in the context of all that has happened.
Today is the day we honor the late Peter Griffin, the hero who saved the Seven Wonders of the World.
Maybe we just talk here for a little bit, and then you can tell everyone that I functioned as I should.
I'm just saying we should go to the library at Quahog University and take your education to a higher level.
I'm gonna go watch that young hotshot attorney over there who's clearly in the middle of a movie montage.
Someone wrote weird on the transgender bathroom, and the school president didn't overreact, so we want him fired!
And last week, a professor told his class to have a nice day, which is microaggression, because in our systemic rape culture no day is a nice day.
Oh, yeah? Someone needs to tell Donald Trump it's not fashionable to wear orange on your face after Labor Day.
Peter, you better get out of here before I start saying sir like a cop.
Yeah, yesterday I went outside to try to get the mail and I had a seizure.
Tell them that it was a mistake and how sorry you are and maybe they'll get off our backs.
But nobody on the Internet ever takes the time to ask themselves, Is this worth freaking out over?
I can't turn on my phone without strangers telling me to kill myself or that they're gonna kill my family.
You screamed black porn at the top of your lungs in front of women and children.
Hey. Are you here for the Time magazines with some of the letters cut out?
If I have other items I want to buy, uh, can I buy them here at the pharmacy window?
If you ask me, Twitter is the perfect place for that guy, because he's a twit.
But an off-color tweet suddenly made Brian a pariah to all of Quahog, forcing the family to make the difficult choice of sending him to a crappy apartment on the other side of town.
You know, you're the only man in America who looks good in sandals and cargo shorts.
We haven't talked since I moved out, so I figured, you know, 10:00, you're probably on the couch watching Pawn Stars.
And I'm gonna move to New York City and walk in and out of my building.
And, besides, today's Dolph Lundgren's birthday, and me and the guys always celebrate it by watching Rocky IV.
Hi. We're concerned that many of you Family Guy fans under 40 didn't get that reference, so I'm gonna take you through the actual commercial.
See... All right, now, what I don't get is, if they know this guy, why are they surprised by the way he talks? Right?
Okay, now you have the information that would've made that funny had you had it going in.
So, watch out, or you might end up in one of my scripts. Martha, gorgeous, headstrong, legs as long as spaghetti noodles, enters.
Hey, I'm a pathetic dog whose family kicked him out, and I want to kill myself.
Not only does he not get up, he's holding a sign that says, Workers of the world, unite!
Oh, man, I wish I could see his face. I'll get right to the point.
My friends and I were aghast when we saw what you did to the end of Rocky IV.
Everyone knows that any American can beat up any Russian on any day of the week.
Chris continues to hit the books as best he can, and his grades have shown some improvement.
All right, Captain America, we have to get ready for the big fight with the other heroes.
You know, as someone who doesn't read the paper or listen to the news, you're not such a bad guy.
To show there are no hard feelings, anyone want to go to strip club and look at some cat emojis with me?
I was kind of thinking of taking my shirt off and riding a horse there.
I.. You know, I-I'm glad you could make it home for the family dinner, Ronan.
You got it, four eyes. Wouldn't miss a dinner with my cuckoo dad for the world.
Dear Lord, please send me a six-foot-seven blonde woman who likes to drink until she blacks out.
Do what I do when people don't pay their rent: plant drugs and call the cops.
I don't know, I-I may be broke, but that seems like a crappy thing to do to somebody.
I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to tell anyone about what happened, and... maybe we could get that drink tomorrow.
Tell 'em you have no idea how your hair strands got in that baggie. Hello, Officer!
You can't just do whatever you want in the world and get away with it.
Ladies and gentlemens, tonight we are here to see the fight to determine East/West superiority.
I can't believe it, but it sounds like the audience is starting to cheer for the American!
The next day, he poisoned me on the limo ride to the airport with radioactive tea.
I lost half my body weight, all my hair, and I have lesions that'll never heal.
Lou, I like you a lot, but I-I think that's the last tape of you having sex with your girlfriend I want to see.
Wow! Meg's so good at casually tossing bottles over her shoulder so they land upright!
Hey, listen, you-you don't think... you don't think you could snag a couple of rolls of toilet paper, could you?
I'm here. I just wanted you to have to sit with those words for a minute.
Well, a few them started this a cappella group, and they're all kind of chubby.
Yeah. We were hanging out in the woods, and... this one girl pushed another girl over while she was peeing.
What, Mom? But I know what you're gonna say, and I know how you're gonna say it.
I'm finally known as something other than the chubby girl who put the lunch lady in a headlock.
If you want to stop by. There's gonna be pizza and soft drinks, then a man's gonna talk about the whole line.
Your friends are all there, and they're so happy to see you, they're practically cheering your name.
You don't have a care in the world, and if all of it came to an end right then and there, so be it.
But now I'm starting to sober up, so I'm gonna need one to keep an even playing field.
I got a little bit of juice left, so we can either A, call someone, maybe they answer, maybe they can help, or B, we can definitely switch faces.
You think it's too early to tie our shirts around our heads to show we're going insane?
Do you feel like lying on the couch, rubbing your eyes, while listening to Lou Reed's Perfect Day?
Brian, a lot of people live in this building, and you can't tell it's a principal just from a walk.
Well... I'm, um... I'm actually doing a documentary about some of the finest principals in the country, and...
And the food, well, I've been stealing it from the high school to make ends meet.
Thanks, Dad, and if this is what drinking makes you feel like, you don't have to worry about it.
You saved the school $206 from all the food they recovered from Principal Shepherd's fridge.
Living on my own was fun, but I couldn't stop thinking about all the stuff
Yeah, I think I'd rather live my life as a loser than feel bad once in a while.
Nothing reminds you more of what you have than watching a grown man poo right through the split in his pants.
We now return to 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, as read by Norm Macdonald. 'Twas the night before Christmas...
You know, two days ago, I was at the donut shop, and I said, Hey, donut guy, you got anything warm back there?
Every year, we gather round and play O Holy Night from our favorite holiday album,
Well, I suppose I better get out of here before that overenthusiastic group of carolers makes their way in here.
Okay, first, I need you to take down last year's Christmas lights and put up this year's Christmas lights.
Then I need you to get the eggnog cups out of the attic and bump your head on a low eave.
After that, take my cousins to the airport and pick up my other cousins at a different, farther away airport.
Then it's just laundry, take out the trash, and move the house a little bit to the left.
I just want to run through your hair like a dog bouncing in tall grass.
Peter, you've lost your Christmas spirit, so I'm taking you on a journey to Christmas Past to find it.
I'll never forget that year, when President Richard Reagan Clinton lied to the American people.
Yeah, looks like your mom really went out of her way to make Christmas special for you.
And I just want you to see that not everyone in Quahog has lost the Christmas spirit.
It's subtle, but when you've been married as long as we have, you notice these things.
And no matter what you show me, there's no way my family won't be right back here spending Christmas with me tomorrow!
Boy, I love the holiday season with my husband who's right upstairs, just out of frame.
I'm going to Brown... four boxes of Jimmy Dean pure pork sausage for my breakfast.
Well, I'm proud all my kids got into Ivy League puns, but what happened to Brian?
Look, I haven't watered my Christmas tree for a few weeks now, so could you watch your really long cigarette, please?
Did I tell you I went to the mall with my daughter and an employee thought we were sisters?
Yeah, it is, except every time Grandpa bends over to get a present, his robe opens up.
Yes, Lois, I'm here, all loaded up with Christmas spirit and a sack full of hastily bought gifts from the CVS.
And for my beloved wife, a lawn chair that was 80% off because it's winter.
And finally, for Meg, a clock radio with an iPod jack for the iPods they don't make anymore.
Not like last year when we went to the Outback Steakhouse, but it's out as in the gay way.
Well, I better set out a can of tuna fish and a cigar for Arthur Valentine.
Some of the kids think he's weird because he takes his shirt off to pee.
And he comes every Valentine's Day on-on a-a... a purple Vespa to, um... to bring candy and sweet notes to children who've managed to not use any swears in the last year.
Plus, he-he wears a Cat in the Hat hat and sometimes a scarf, no matter what Lois says because it gives him a youthful vibe and adds some color to his face.
I assumed he'd outgrow it in a few years, but, Peter, it's time we have a talk with Chris.
Donna and I are spending our Valentine's Day in Johnnie Cochran pajamas, just caressing each other in a very beige bedroom.
She laid out a trail of rose petals, and I elbow-crawled to the sponge and shower chair.
I go down to the video store and put my hand on Love Actually at the same time as a woman, and I go, Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Our top story, today the Quahog River was dyed red in honor of Valentine's Day.
Well, Brian, if you're stuck being a single loser, you might as well just embrace it.
I-It's actually time your father and I had a talk with you about Arthur Valentine.
You know, if Chris is this hard to convince, we may just have to kill Arthur Valentine.
No, they don't, because I'm an adult, which is kind of what I was getting at.
Uh, I got this small cut, and they wanted to bandage it so I'd stop chewing the crap out of my foot.
And it's so great dating someone who understands why it's especially important to walk around in a circle many, many times before lying down.
You know, I-I know they're not supposed to be that bright, but that was, that was pretty genius, you know?
I mean, leave it, leave it to a Polack to just grab the paint with his hands and just start chucking it everywhere.
Listen, I'm really sorry to cut things short, but I've got to go; I have rehearsal.
I mean, I... God, I-I bet every time you go snaffling on it, you have to stop and admire it.
Nancy, will you make me the happiest man in the world by turning a blind eye to the AIDS crisis and ineffectually trying to warn young people about drugs?
Robin Williams tossed a baseball to Robert De Niro, and he snapped out of it and caught it.
Let's-let's twirl some toilet paper up into his nose, and-and then when... we'll-we'll do your thing.
I smell the poop on your breath, and then that's all I want, but my owners made an arrangement with the organizers of the next dog show.
They paid a lot of money to schedule me to breed with whichever male dog wins the competition.
I know it might seem odd to you, but this happens in the dog show world.
I have to have sex with whichever male dog wins, whoever that ends up being.
All right Brian, now if we're going to get you ready to compete in that dog show, we've got a lot of training to cover.
You click it when you want me to do a trick, and then I get a treat, so I associate the two.
Uh, you know, I... You-you just made dog shows sound so fun the other day, I-I thought I'd give it a try.
I have to destroy your brain and then talk about it for the next hour!
Valentine's Day would take on new meaning for Chris in the years to come, but he would remember none so bittersweetly as this one.
Because this thing is gonna come down to the arbitrary whims of whatever elderly volunteers were able to get transportation here on a Tuesday.
If-if you just-just give me a second to get, like, a scenario in my head.
I'm just not sure how this could work or-or how our relationship could fit into your world.
Okay, we're at the part where he bites down on the back of my neck, so we should probably wrap this up.
If-if it hadn't been for all that, I... trust me, I-I would've, I would've set her world on fire.
I can't tell if they have a really good marriage or a really bad one.
This is a 14-hour meditation on the importance of family, fast cars, product placement, racial ambiguity and family.
Someone said they were going to get me eight on Blu-ray for my birthday, and someone got me a limited edition
Like Africa and Asia had sex while Europe sat on a chair in the corner of the hotel room and watched.
We just missed the scene where half the team steals a tank while the other half pretends to be a DJ for some reason.
This is the best thing to happen to me since I became a wisecracking, fourth-wall-breaking superhero.
So? If you were driving drunk and ran him over, would you still go to jail?
He always knew there was something off about you, and now we know what it was. You're a psycho!
I'm looking for Stewie. He and I had a fight, and I'm scared he might've done something drastic.
Yeah, well, he cremated that stuffed animal, and he's going to Vermont to scatter the ashes.
Hmm. Well, violent murderers can often be found at bus stations, so why am I surprised?
He and I had an agreement, if he died first, I would scatter his ashes on a mountain.
If I died first, he would throw my body whole into the fountain at the Bellagio.
Oh, come on. If I don't, I'll get stuck next to that guy with the heavy hands.
I swear to God, do not take one step further, or I will hit you.
I was sick of you complaining to him about me when I'm right there in the room.
Just reply to that last GIF she sent of the sloth putting on the headphones.
Is it weird that we're in a group text with our friend's wife but not our friend?
Well, how the hell was I supposed to know it was gonna upset you so much?
You saw me spend almost every single minute of every single day with Rupert since I was born!
He was the most important thing in my life, and you willfully violated the sanctity and trust of our friendship when you destroyed him!
Why are you so upset over a doll when I'm real and I'm still here?
And one day, all too soon, I'm gonna be crying at your funeral in an Armani suit, and people are gonna be like, Oh, nice suit, and I'm gonna be like, Why are you talking about my awesome $2,000 suit... my friend's dead!
Stewie... and I are both... incredibly grateful for all the time we had with you, and we wouldn't change a single moment.
It reminds me of the therapist's office Bethenny Frankel goes to on The Real Housewives of New York City.
He originally wanted me for The Rachel Zoe Project, but I said no, so they went with Brad.
And now look... that could've been me on Fashion Police with Melissa Rivers 14 times a year.
I haven't heard of any of the schools you went to, but I'm sure they were great.
Well, just the people who can understand me, which you appear to be one of.
I see you're on vacation in Rio de Janeiro in this photo with your partner, I'm guessing.
At a quick glance, I'd say there's roughly a 26-year age difference between the two of you.
Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows while still giving you a younger mind to shape. Oh, you mean you haven't seen All About Eve,
Taking into consideration the math, he was probably born at a time when the most popular name was...
And no one had ever done anything so romantic as reciting Shakespeare for Michael before.
You don't want to worry Michael, you say to yourself, even though the truth is it embarrasses you.
And no need to have reminders at home of what's just around the corner, is there?
And your office is your haven, since Michael doesn't work and is often at home, perhaps as a result of a low-level depression that you don't really want to get into with him.
Oh, he always planned to have a career, but he could never settle on exactly what it was he wanted to do.
And at first you liked having him at home to take care of the house and plan trips.
So that's just what happened. And that's a job, too, he reminds you over the years.
But it's a bit difficult on a child psychologist's salary at a Rhode Island preschool, I'd imagine.
Oh, you have talked about it with other couples, just for show, probably at dinner with younger friends of Michael's who are starting a family, you know, to be part of the conversation, to feel included.
But you said you preferred your trips and your rescue dog named after a character most likely from Dickens.
Now, I see you're both wearing Ralph Lauren Purple Label dress shirts that retail starting at $495.
But from the disfigured button holes on one and the small discoloration on the other,
I can see that you went there during summer vacation, which is, in fact, winter in Rio, outside of the high tourist season.
And I see that you're on the rooftop pool deck at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema, the most exclusive hotel in all of Brazil.
Had a friend that went with his older boyfriend, who makes a lot of money in, most likely, banking, much to your chagrin.
The window that Michael is always desperately peering through and sadly on the other side of.
You don't go on Airbnb, because you don't trust it, even though Michael has stories of friends who have found the most fabulous places.
But when you take him to the place you're actually staying, the one you found on TripAdvisor that was rated number 27 of all the hotels in Rio and was having a special rate of 295 U.S. dollars a night...
Which is still not cheap, you remind him, most people never get to visit half the places he's seen, you tell him... you can't help but feel like a bit of a failure as you see the look of disappointment on his face as he enters the room.
So you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks, once you've seen the restaurant prices online.
And once there, you can see how Michael begins looking at all the older men who can afford to take their boyfriends... I'm sorry, husbands...
And you worry a little, that you're diminishing in his eyes with each passing year.
But you tell yourself you're being ridiculous, as you see Michael glancing about the rooftop deck, looking at all the young men, men that would be 20 years younger than even Michael, men that you're invisible to.
But he isn't yet, not completely, and you're jealous and you loathe yourself for it.
But you say, Let's ask someone to take one of us and make some tired joke about selfies that only you laugh at, wishing that you could take it out of the air as soon as you've said it, as it's just one more indicator that you're older than everybody here.
So Michael calls over a young man wearing a tiny swimsuit to take the photo and makes a crude joke that embarrasses you.
But the young man laughs, and he and Michael share a moment that you're not part of.
And you've posted the photo on Facebook, and Michael's posted it to his 86 followers on Instagram...
To at least give the impression, in your Ralph Lauren shirts, holding your $20 cocktails, that you're both way more successful than you are.
But it makes you feel a little dirty, the lengths you have to go to in order to keep Michael happy.
And every time you glance at this picture, you wonder, How long before he leaves me?
I try to fit in with the other boys and talk about things like dirt and shapes, but they won't play with me.
I only pushed Tyler down the stairs because I like him and I'm afraid he won't like me back.
But do I think that Grant Gustin and I would make the most adorable Instagram couple?
I just... I just want to be like everybody else, but nobody's interested in the things that I'm interested in.
And I'm so anxious all the time, but I... I always put on a brave face and try to hide it, and I... I give myself these excruciating migraines.
Some people don't think I talk about it enough anymore, but mind your own beeswax is what I say to them.
It's hard to find someone who can converse on one of those topics, let alone both.
And I really, really, really want to see Hamilton, but by the time it gets here, I'll be 30.
I think I'm still the only one in town who's even heard of it, and it's been out for over two years.
And I've even memorized some of the songs, but I have no one to sing it for, and I'm really good.
If you liked Tyler and you wanted to be friends with him, then why did you push him down the stairs?
But she didn't care for children, and off again I went, this time to an orphanage in Gloucestershire.
I'm only here for 40 minutes, and this is already a really long story with a lot of locations.
And I don't feel like waiting to see how it links up to my thing.
I know what it's like to feel alone and to have to pretend that you're something you're not.
The accent is-is nothing more than an affectation, a-a coat of armor to get me through the day, just an image I cultivated so I could feel special.
For once, to talk with my real voice without the... the burden of trying to sound like someone I'm not.
Well, I'm honored, and now, the rest of the world is going to meet him.
I'd like to, really I would, and you were super helpful, and this... this kind of seems like a crummy way to repay you, but... I'm not going to get it.
It was like an orchestra of squeaky chair springs and groaning floorboards playing her out.
Sowwy. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace. And lips, O, you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss, a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
I do, but our friend Bartholomew went in lots of chimneys in the '80s, and now he's sick.
When I see a man about to go on a sea voyage and not wearing a topcoat, with no watch fob, and whose spats are not fully buttoned...
Well, you see, the children of today are wearing their pantaloons so low, gazoozle, you can see the first three layers of their undergarments, zazzle, zoozle.
Mum, may I say, it's been a pleasure serving you, but I've decided to retire.
But with Moriarty gone, and with you, my biographer, leaving me for marriage, there is little point.
And you, old chap, are about to solve the biggest mystery facing men of our time: the wedding night.
Lifting her nightgown, nightshirt, evening cape, boudoir coverall, torso doily, and the various corsets and trusses below.
Boiled beef for every guest, fish head stew, old cheese, and men's attire will be provided by Gentlemen's Wearhouse.
Now I've got to see if I can dig that hat out of the trash.
This one's name is Veronica, as evidenced by this satin softball jacket that bears her name.
There are only two possible explanations: either there's a murderer who has copied the Scottish Brute's methods, or I put the wrong man away.
All right, let's get out of here before we're all arrested for the crime of bum-fancy.
Yes. Now, I'll stroll around the block, and you'll proposition me, loud enough so the killer can hear.
Oh, I've done enough of that, my friend, especially after that raucous bachelor party trip you threw for me in Las Vegas.
Watson, I don't know how to tell you this... but the murderer we've been looking for... it's your fiancée, Constance.
If she's a murderer from this time period, that means there will be a terrible, pretentious musical about her one day.
Room Temperature Gin: drink it without women, have an eel pie, then go to bed.
Quick, after her. We have to chase her through a series of shots where she has an inconsistent lead on us.
I still don't understand what she meant by he said you'd never figure it out, and... That he'd be victorious.
So, you concocted an elaborate series of murders with clues leading me to the fictional Scottish Brute.
She arranges for me to kill your imposter... and commits an identical murder so I would come to the inescapable conclusion that I put the wrong man away.
Constance would lead us away from England while you killed the last prostitute with the name V.
From South Africa to the Suez Canal, from Cyprus to Australia, all of Canada and Grenada, even Antigua and Jamaica.
Thank you for protecting us and for posting revenge porn on Marine Corps message boards.
I don't have time to hear the rest of your sentence, but thank you for being a veteran because you're definitely a veteran.
Wow. Feels real good to be a veteran, even better than buying a bottle of Newman's Own.
And I'm sickened by the thought of trolling for free handouts on account of being a vet, much less pretending to be one.
Well, as a veteran, I get to star in a viral YouTube video of me reuniting with my beloved pet.
This is my heterosexual roommate, Ace, with whom I shared the lion two decades ago.
You know, guys, if being a veteran is about anything, it's about getting half-hearted applause on a Southwest Airlines flight.
The Nathan James is the fictitious ship on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Adam Baldwin and Jocko Sims.
You three are in violation of the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to pretend to be a veteran.
Mr. Quagmire, you're free to go, but the rest of you will have to come with me.
You men are accused of violating the Stolen Valor Act, and that's years of jail time.
I'll waive the charges, but only on the condition that you men enlist in the military for real.
Glenn, if you were half the man I used to be, you'd stand up and join them.
The way people's talking makes me think we're gonna be dealing with a lot of water.
You guys seem to have what it takes, so raise your right hand as I recite the Coast Guard pledge. When you're here, you're family.
Compared to the Navy, the Coast Guard is totally unprofessional and incompetent, like that ancient Roman intern.
Affirmative. And, Joe, I order you to just let the binoculars fall right out of your hands, but you don't even notice
I got to have a FaceTime conversation with my wife where we talk at the same time, and then stop, and then start again, then laugh.
I wasn't sentenced, but I came anyway because I thought I could try and teach my friends what it means to serve their country, the way I did.
We should probably all go urinate together, outdoors, as a group of guys, while wearing backwards baseball caps, per Fort Lauderdale municipal law.
You're right. Compared to him, we're about as useless as one of those automatic bathroom sinks.
If there's gonna be an attack at spring break, we can't just stand by while people get hurt, or even killed.
No, Peter, it's not; it's just the coolest, freshest way to keep your party rolling is what it is.
Well, I don't know what that is, but let's make a very long, elaborate plan.
Oh, hey, Brian. I was sick of waiting my turn outside the supermarket, so I bought every coin-operated horse in town.
I don't know, Stewie, if you ask me, the stock market's just a rigged game where the top one-percent make out like bandits, and regular people get hurt.
Our top story, an austere monetary policy has the European Union on the brink of collapse, threatening the entire global economy.
And for viewers making less than $40,000 a year, your top story is a big UFC fight this Saturday.
Tell you what, give me a hundred bucks to put in the stock market, and I'll take care of it.
And there's no one to take care of her, so, unfortunately, I'll be gone for a while.
Hey, Brian, I need to talk to you about that money I invested for you.
Brian, there's a 22-year-old Mongolian heiress who's being held captive in a mountain fortress that happens to have a pommel horse in it.
I'm sorry, Billy, you're one dollar short of being able to afford the surgery you need.
In fact, we're so successful now, we have to make one of those sappy investment commercials.
Now that we're eccentric rich guys, we're going to go down 20,000 feet and pants James Cameron while he's excavating the Titanic.
I've been pretty cool about this so far, it's a gentlemen's game. In what country can you find the monuments called...
I see phones. I see... all right, you know what, that's it, trivia night over!
Technically, you got to finish the game before you get your drink. In which country...
Yeah, right. How can it get mad when I cinched its balls with my belt?
Excellent choice. You know, not to tell tales out of school, but I sucked my first jug to this song.
No way. It's from when Arya and that other tiny girl fight to the death.
This is what you dragged me out of the house first thing in the morning for?
This is why I didn't want to let you have a soda in the car.
Yeah, but wasn't there another case that was only thrown out because the statute of limitations had expired?
And if you're too scared to do it with me, then maybe I'm working with the wrong partner.
Yeah, no, I didn't see it either, but, yeah, the, the Flash was the name of her rock band.
We have to paint that portrait of Jerome's mother ourselves, and this is the only class in town.
But aren't these classes just for lame chicks who want an excuse to drink together?
All right. Now, I'm not sure if I'm saying this right, but, uh, Boo. Cocky.
You would think, after all these years together, that I could simply tell myself enough is enough.
I always thought I'd go the way all dogs dream about: slowly, and at great inconvenience to my owners.
Lois, wrap one of his walking to the car pills in roast beef and peanut butter.
I'm gonna hold his hips while he stands confused in front of the water dish.
Well, I guess all we can do now is the honorable thing: make realistic puppets of ourselves to leave in the bar for Jerome to beat the crap out of.
Well, don't just sit there staring at me with your limp limbs and your straw-filled aid shirts.
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin, and I'm here at The Museum of Television & Radio to commemorate Family Guy becoming the longest-running show in television history.
Family Guy has survived two assassination attempts, and a pretty good ribbing by those South Park guys.
Well, tonight we take a look back at classic episodes from our first three decades.
Raleigh Kids Cigarettes is happy to bring you Family Guy, the story of an American family named the Griffins.
And now, Raleigh Kids, also the makers of Kinder Coffee, invites you to watch Family Guy.
So, what's going on if a guy says a girl has a red scare in her Harry Truman?
Our top story this evening, songsmith Elvis Presley will be appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night on that never-gonna-last fad called television.
I spent our entire savings building that stupid fallout shelter we never get to use.
Why don't you just buy a TV for the weekend, watch Elvis, and then return it on Monday and say it doesn't work?
I don't want to go to work in soft underpants like some Nancy boy; I want to go to work like this.
We now return to 1950s sci-fi, which is always a man in a silver suit battling a monster.
I am a 1950s man speaking in a stilted manner, seemingly with no self-awareness whatsoever.
I am shouting for some reason and will now suddenly be replaced by crude graphics.
Sorry, Peter. I wanted to tell you, but you were so dead set against it.
Come on, Donna, let's pick up some gizzards and fried skins and head on down to the juke joint.
But I was banished to the sidewalk because I called one of the band guys a bad name.
Instead of eating in another room and talking, what if we bring the food out here and never talk again?
Try Post Raisin Bran, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
When you eat Raisin Bran, it fills your stomach and keeps you from feeling the sensation of hunger. Hunger being pangs in the belly as a result of lack of nourishment, thereby sending signals to your brain telling you, Hey, I'm hungry.
And when you hear Mr. Hey, I'm Hungry, be sure to have a hearty bowl of Post Raisin Bran.
Again, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
It's made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time.
Like-like it's funny to hit me so violently my body will fly out of the atmosphere?
So, if you see news reports about a Roy Mitchell from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
You know, Meg, when you tattle on someone, you're not just telling on them, you're telling on yourself.
So, if you see any news reports about an actor named Robert Reed from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
Why not, Dad? Is it any worse than your three X's drawn on the jug corn whiskey moonshine?
That's why I'm so grateful I got here before you dropped acid or took any kind of drugs that...
Then you can grow up like a man, like track and field star Bruce Jenner, the greatest man in the world.
Chris, I see in the paper that Vietnam is still going on, and as a blue collar TV dad, I demand you enlist.
As a matter of fact, his tour just ended and his transport should be getting in soon.
So let's head down to the airfield and give our soldiers the respect they deserve.
I went to the draft board and told them I was gay, and then got hit by a bus on the walk home.
I know you enjoy staring, like, but you got any good stories I could tell him about how cool 'Nam is?
I got to get him out to there. I thought this war would be fun, you know, just go over there and fight the Donkey Kong.
We were trying to fight the war our way, the way we'd always fought wars, but we were gradually climbing steel beams and ladders, and the Donkey Kong knew that.
And I hope the exhibits here at The Museum of Television & Radio don't come to life like Night at the Museum.
It's a magic genie speaker that plays music, talks and knows stuff, all without wires.
All right, let me squinch my face up and put on a pair of glasses I never wear to look at these directions.
You see? Right there, this device is a perfect example of how we continue to become more inept due to our dependency upon machines.
There was a time, not too long ago, when people would talk to each other.
Top critic on Rotten Tomatoes says, I walked out of the theater, and I'm Ed Helms.
He also said, No, thanks, every hot woman, I'll take this woman crawling out of the well from The Ring who none of my friends like.
History's largest bowel movement occurred in 1998, at a Hardee's in Memphis, by Aretha Franklin.
Maybe if you stopped feeling sorry for yourself, you could actually do something positive with your life.
I'm just gonna lie down on the couch with my head on the armrest to accentuate how sad I am.
You know, Brian, if I had... aw... one day in your body, I would give it back to you with a new and improved life.
Wait, wait, wait. So when you said spend a day in my body, you were being literal?
I chose the one where my voice will be coming from your body, and vice-versa.
Still, from time to time, we will have to imitate the other person's voice to fool those who don't know what we've done, which is everyone.
Fine. But just for the record, every device you've ever made has broken at some crucial juncture.
Okay, I'm off to get you a job, a girlfriend, and onto the road less scummy.
My research shows that every seven minutes, a professor is fired for having sex with one of his students.
Well, it's a long story, but I was really hoping to come home with a job and a girlfriend today.
Also, I know this is a big inconvenience, but you and the trash guy now wave to each other.
Oh, and you're gonna hate this, but I gave him the salute, so you're a salute guy now.
This is a total disaster, like when the fat man tried to keep Michael Shannon from going insane.
Hey, I realized I can reach the animal crackers, so I'm actually gonna be a while.
It's the couples' sex seminar where the husband learns how to give his wife an orgasm.
Lois signed us up for some perverse, pee-pee-related class on the female orgasm. She's crazed.
Yeah, well, why do I have the overwhelming urge to eat Cheetos and masturbate in the woods?
Okay, everyone, please put your bananas and donuts back on the table, we're done with that exercise.
I'm confused as hell, but I'm enjoying these graham crackers, so I'm not gonna say anything.
I'm standing here for some reason doing the weather in a giant black man's body.
This just in, all kids report to the blue van in the park at 3:00 p.m. for free Popsicles.
All right, now you got to reverse the voltage orientation and amplify the electron flow to the motherboard.
Great. Now we need to find an energy source powerful enough to match the electrical surge that swapped the town in the first place.
According to my GPS, you're 20 feet from the base of the Quahog cell phone tower.
Now I need you to strap the body swapper on your back and climb to the top of the tower.
Sales are down across the board, but mostly we're failing to connect with a group called millennials.
Millennials crave things like: instant gratification, authentic experiences, and, for some reason we haven't figured out yet, improv comedy.
So please welcome someone who's gonna help us reach millennials, our new head of social media, Hammer.
And now here comes a text from the guy who doesn't know this is a group text. Nice to meet you, Hammer. Let's have lunch later, and I'll tell you who's gay.
Uh, first I'd like to not thank you for hiring me, because I just expect good things to happen to me without working for them.
Actually, brah, asking me what a trigger warning is is one of my triggers, brah.
Now, if we want to get some social media attention, we got to start with a group selfie.
It's six un-showered guys and a pale woman with a ukulele shouting Hey! in unison.
That's because anytime someone walks through a cloud of vape smoke, a millennial is born.
It's a great place to see bands that are either really new or really old.
Well, on the main stage, it's Tame Impala that formed in an UberPOOL on the way here.
Next thing is you got to learn how to be on Fleek. On fleek? People still say on fleek?
What's that? Sorry, I was taking a selfie while shooting a Snapchat while Periscoping that Snapchat while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming The Weekend while streaming Master of None while retweeting George Takei while saying, This wins the Internet! while still being soooo bored.
Listen, I made breakfast and drove, so if there's a dead dong, I'm gonna look at it!
We've all lost a great friend-slash-barista- slash-deejay- slash-Genius Bar employee- slash-person with a yellow highlighter at the Best Buy exit.
Peter, I hate to do this here, but you were good friends with Hammer, and business at the brewery must go on.
All right, guys, I got to come up with some social media ideas for the brewery. What do ya got?
Well, I guess that could work. But it's just so sad that young people can't pay attention to something longer than six sec...
Peter, I can't believe your talk show is such a huge hit for the brewery.
Now, I haven't had the time to watch it, but I hear it's the buzz of Silicon Valley.
I want you and your family to visit us here as my guests, so I can find out what the next big thing is.
Oh, except that trip to Europe where we spent most of our time trying to refold our map.
I'd be able to find the creases if somebody had folded it correctly last time.
Nope, you didn't, and then, you jammed it into a backpack and now I'm in this mess.
Don't blame me, you ripped it up when you were tearing through the backpack for your snacks.
As our name suggests, our mainframe connects to and powers virtually every server on the globe.
I had to admire his courage for leaving his penis out the entire time I was yelling at him.
Years later, we would bump into each other at a small cafe in Rome and reminisce about this moment.
And later still, recreate it in a small bed and breakfast at the bottom of the Spanish Steps.
Peter, you've done some stupid things, but crashing the Internet has to be the dumbest yet.
Now, because you can't stare at your phone anymore, enjoy a disturbingly loud clip of Jimmy Fallon on cab TV.
Tonight, get ready to lose all respect for Al Pacino when I force him to play a game meant for children!
From now on, if you want to tweet something, you do it the old-fashioned way: write it on a piece of paper, staple it to a bird, and throw it out the door.
Great news, Chris. I figured out how to recreate the best part of the Internet.
Oh, no! You pressed in the wrong place, and now you're being sent to the ad's website, which also has additional pop-ups.
Oh, this is just my looping GIF of black teens reacting to a very mild burn.
We'll just have to roll up our sleeves and do the best we can, like the men who built New York City.
But just remember: we're doing this so that one day, future commuters can be hassled by panhandlers and amateur break-dancers.
Is it me, or does David Ortiz look just like the mom on Good Times?
Hey, guys, guess who's got the keys to a speedboat just sitting down at the station?
If we're gonna collect our ten grand, we need to figure out where he went.
I know the answer is no, but is there any chance there's time for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?
Well, Mr. Griffin, there's no easy way to put this, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
At least you're not this pathetic guy who couldn't get his boat in the water.
Listen, Quagmire, I got just the way for you to embrace your new life without a penis.
Florida. Which, interesting trivia, was the name of the mom in Good Times played by David Ortiz.
And those greens are playing very fast, so he's gonna have to use caution on his approach.
Well, I'm looking for a place with good schools, and, because he works in the city, he's looking for an easy commute.
Yeah, she teaches here at the high school and I work in town as a choreographer and florist.
I just came by to thank you for giving me the kick in the pants I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself
And I wanted to invite you guys to the opening of my new show at the Quahog Playhouse.
You're talking to a wooden doll to make up for the fact that you can't have sex anymore.
Are you really gonna just sit there after all the crap white people have given you your whole life?
I told them Mort gave us his flash drive with enough evidence to put them all in jail.
I knew you were down in the dumps, so I brought you something to cheer you up.
Well, Brian, we may not have gotten the $10,000, but it'll be a joy to hear no more Jewish talk for a long while. Brian and Stewie laugh. The image freezes.
I try to tell them it's my dad's old penis, but that, um... that just tends to make it worse.
I just wish we were doing songs that weren't so hard to sing as a group.
We now return to a 1980s movie you remember fondly, but now feels excruciatingly slow.
I hope you don't plan on just lying on the couch and watching TV all weekend.
I don't need you to. I got a thousand dollar credit from Uber Eats 'cause that driver pinched my bottom.
When a fat guy's sweaty skin presses against couch fabric for an extended period of time, the fabric fibers fuse together with the skin.
Being fused to furniture hasn't stopped me from being an adult with a child's name.
Every adult has to take Ambien every night to even have a prayer at sleep.
All right, kids, we're gonna use these scissors to separate your father from the couch.
I work my ass off to bring home the bacon for this family, and all you can say is, We don't want bacon, we want actual money!
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to sleep on the couch on the couch.
Just look down, all right? Just-just look at me, look what I'm doing. All right, see the way I'm twisting it?
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler.
Well, you had a couch attached to your back, and you fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty hard.
Sometimes, I pull them out just so they think everything is gonna be okay, but then, I put them right back in.
Let me finish. You were Henry, the eighth guy to have sex with Rock Hudson at one of his pool parties.
I like to believe there's something bigger than me out there keeping a watch out.
When I used to ask my mom what God was, she would say, God is love. I always liked that.
Since you're now a ghost, would you like to do pottery while straddling present-day Demi Moore?
Oh, please. He played that for all it was worth. Why has thou forsaken me?
I'll give you one day to prove to me that your family is better off with you alive.
Okay, kids. I know how you always wanted kittens, so guess what I brought home?
You're all gonna get up, go back up to that toppings bar, and go nuts.
Half of it is supposed to fall onto your plate when you squeeze it, and the rest goes onto your shirt.
See, look, now I have to be even more ridiculous to make up for what you guys aren't doing.
Yeah, they're saying, Look at the creative guy. Look at King Fuddrucker over there. Usually you put a burger on a tray.
I'll miss you more than life... the cereal, but not the board game, which I quite enjoy.
I'm sorry I'll never get a chance to walk you down the aisle... at Costco, to furnish your sad, single-lady apartment.
And Stewie, it kills me that I'll never see you become a man... loving twink.
I'm gonna stay out here and listen to Nina Blackwood slowly die of throat cancer on the radio.
I'm supposed to get her a week from Thursday, but I may be moving that up.
It's weird. For the first seven days, all I did was create things, but since then, it's just killing, killing, killing.
Well, Lois, let's just say the big man upstairs put in a hard day's work today.
Brian, why are you dressed like a douche who hangs out with multiracial friends in a McDonald's commercial?
And you never will, because the truth is you're a selfish horndog who's getting too old for the game.
I beg to differ. I think I've got the lingo of today's lady down pat.
I'm still recovering from that one thing you did that was so obscene, it couldn't even be described on lame, dying network TV.
Jess, I would like to help you cross off every single item on this list.
And when she gets back from the bathroom, none of you say anything about cancer.
I'm serious. I really enjoy spending time with this woman, and I don't want you ruining it for me.
There's nothing worse than when you're flipping channels, and you're like, Oh, God, it's Terminal. Don't say it's Terminal. God, what have I done to deserve this?
I'm just some woman who never got to have the career she wanted or get married or have kids.
It would be my honor if you spent the rest of your life as my bride.
Brian? It would mean the world to me if you wore my tux from when I got married.
But every year when I go to the Emmys, the heat I'm packin' is clumpy and smells terrible.
I'm not. I want you to be the ring bearer, and wear a vest and a boutonniere
But it's still wrong. There's no way you'd be marrying this woman if she wasn't going to die
Did you know that Lois was so moved she called Channel Five to do a profile of me and Jess?
And now get out your tissues, it's a real-life Quahog version of The Fault in Our Stars, the novel and hit movie your gay nephew quotes on Facebook.
Listen, I want to throw you the wildest bachelor party of all time. It's gonna be crazier than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.
Hmm. I still think the butter cream was the best cake I've thrown up so far.
Wow. I haven't gotten this kind of attention since I went to see The Peanuts Movie.
I-I was thinking maybe you could move in with me and Jess, because I-I know you'd want to be with her for her final days.
I vow to honor you and cherish you until the day I die, a week from Wednesday.
I'm so happy to place this ring on the weird dog thumb you have halfway up your arm.
With this ring, I vow to honor you and cherish you... for the rest of the month.
Come on. It was prescribed by a doctor to a guy named John Selvaggio who has a mailbox that he can't see from his front yard.
Tinazidine: the white, plastic pouch in your neighbor's mailbox that might be three months of drugs.
Ooh, I'm going straight to the kitchen to make my favorite meal in a tiny apartment: microwaved salmon.
Hey, listen, thanks for renting to us even though we have ten cats and couldn't make the deposit.
I was going to help you move in but you don't really own anything, do you?
We got countless letters after our profile of the Cancer Girl who won her sweetheart's paw in marriage.
We can spend the extra money on the big photos of fetuses I hold while I yell at people outside Panera.
It's all about how she's having her period, but the other guy she wanted to impress...
I'd like to thank you all for coming to honor the memory of my beloved wife Jess...
I don't have bedbugs. I'm burning it down so I can fake my own death.
Get a hole in one, new pair shows up in my drawer, just like that.
We're gonna have a great adventure, like the astronaut who thinks the lowest number is three.
Wearing the ring also makes you wear giant khaki shorts with a belt and a lot of keys rattling around in the pockets.
Well, yeah, Brian. Every man's true weight is at least 20 pounds heavier than how they look.
Complete with the popular kid who's clearly going to die in a car accident tonight.
I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands are a little worried about you.
I'm not re what dysplasia is, but I do know you don't often see a Y that far up in a word.
I took the liberty of X-raying my own hip to show you what a normal one looks like.
It tastes great and I don't feel violently ill as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs.
Plus, when you wake at night shaking because you haven't had any in three hours, it's so easy to vape more.
Let's face it, this is the most fun we've had since Mom got hooked on coffee and bought that Alpuccino maker.
Sometimes it's been difficult to cook with all the other things I have to do for Brian.
And if that's not bad enough, you leave it out for Stewie to get his hands on it?
Technically, that was not my vape pen, but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine.
Well, for 200 bucks, I'll strangle you with my bare hands and stare into your eyes as you die.
You could have saved my life in the restaurant, but you let me choke to death.
W-Well, and I should've kept taking care of you, instead of bringing you here to have you killed.
I mean, gosh, maybe that's what true marriage is... two people who want each other to die.
Oh, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died during the commercial break, but it was a very nice funeral service.
Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret after you lied to me about sneaking cigarettes?
Chris, the only reason I told him was he promised he'd keep his mouth shut.
At last, I shall exact my vengeance and snuff out the miserable flame that has been your life, vile woman.
Grown men who have never had sexual relations fly them over people's houses to try and see something. I don't know.
And you sound like you were lost at sea and told not to drink seawater but drank seawater.
Peter, I was once a lot like you: unmotivated, dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways...
But first, here's that cutaway I was gonna do before you made me skip it.
Peter, I've seen thousands of people over the years and helped every single one of them.
That may be true, but the lightning bolt that killed me seems to have magically transferred my personal power...
Peter, I told you I was going to help you, and I'm not leaving until I make good on my promise.
Hey, if you're dead, can you ask Bill Paxton if he's the same as Bill Pullman?
Well, I hope you don't use your guns to kill your mom or do anything bad.
And I always tell it like it is, like when I used to write tombstones.
All right, you have to take us to lunch, but first we need to take our nap.
I got the role during the two months I was a hot actor, and now they're stuck with me.
This new you is a bigger surprise than when they're making fun of a celebrity on Saturday Night Live and the real-life celebrity walks in behind them.
I mean, wherever they are at this particular moment, if they're watching, they must be...
I demanded a raise just like you told me to and they gave it to me.
Hey, everybody, we want to give a special shout-out to little Hudson on his birthday.
I-I just... I saw how you were connecting with Hudson and I-I was afraid of losing our friendship.
So Brian and I are down in Mexico, and, as usual, he doesn't have any cash on him.
So, now that you got me back as a friend, what are all the great things you have planned for us?
And you were such a jealous little bitch that you had to ruin the one friendship I really cared about.
You're just a big jerk and I hate you, and there's nothing you can do to make up for it.
You know, Brian, I'm starting to think we're going to get through our... Rocky Road.
We had a lot of laughs tonight, but let's remember the important thing: you can't put a price on your happiness, which is why I have: it's $6,000.
He was too light for the caterpillar slide, too short for the piñata, and too scared to touch the animals in the petting zoo.
All right, try to make this sound gay: next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.
After that, I'll be taking the role of Major Dixon Butts, then Senator Rod Clutcher.
Well, we'll just see who's the bigger man. Brian, sorry I got testy. Let's bury the hatchet. If you're free, I'd love to hear about any new writing projects you're working...
Well, first off, I got this screenplay for Tom Cruise, about the queen's private secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.
But I'm a millennial, so first I have to watch a YouTube instructional video on how to do it.
I'm Corey, and today I'm gonna teach you how to get your friend out of a rat hole.
And, guys, I'll get to as many comments as I can, but I can't get to all of them.
But in the meantime, they say if you put your finger in a rat's butt, that disables it.
Well, every '80s movie had one, so the fat man thought we should have one, too.
You know, it's funny, you said every '80s movie, but I can't think of a single one.
You know, it was probably greenlit in the '80s, when lattices were still a thing.
While I adjust the settings, you go over there and hit the tiny button to fire it up.
Girly Friendston, you stop mooning over that boyfriend of yours and get down here this instant.
I can't believe there's this whole universe hidden here in your rug... where everyone speaks English.
And if you guys help us, we'll make sure you never want for water again.
I'm trying to explain that guns are hazardous and unsafe, not have a conversation about a tepid 1990s Canadian sketch group.
Anyway, I hid the gun someplace safe until I can figure out how to properly dispose of it.
All right, let's all take turns looking down the barrel with one eyeball and see if we can figure out what's going on.
Like when Peter was the only one not wearing black jeans at a Rush concert.
We're gonna bring him home with us and take care of him until he's 100%.
All right, Daddy living here is gonna be a big adjustment, and we're all gonna have to make sacrifices.
So, Meg, Daddy will sleep in your room, and Stewie and Chris, you'll stay where you are.
All right, Carter, now we're gonna try and jog your memory and get you talking with some familiar pictures.
Peter, come on. We're trying to help Daddy, not relive our embarrassing loss to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.
All right, Daddy, I know NCIS is on, but I want to watch Real Housewives, unless you tell me not to.
These two have a three-year-old feud based on an offhanded remark at a charity fashion show.
I'm sure Andy Cohen will explain it all on Watch What Happens Live after the show.
Yeah, Carter. You know, you've always been a real bastard, but I got to say, it's nice to see you turning things around.
Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize that I wasted my whole life caring about money, and I'm not giving up another second.
That's why I've decided to retire from Pewterschmidt Industries and give all my money to charity.
Thanks. You know, I was a little worried you guys would be mad about losing your inheritance.
I've seen what wealth's done to you, and I certainly don't want that to happen to us.
Look, I know you're upset about losing our inheritance, but when we got married, the first thing I told you is I didn't want Daddy's money.
For the first time in my life, I have a father who's kind and wants to spend time with me.
It's the only way I can afford that surgery to turn myself into 100% stained glass.
So to get our inheritance, we have to figure out a way to make him mean again.
Well, you know what gets Gargamel all riled up is those pesky Smurfs. Maybe there's something there.
Why don't we hire a transvestite to pick him up at a bar, then take off her wig at the exact moment of completion?
Why don't we take him to a truck stop bathroom, and then after completion, we...
You know, this may be crazy, but I'd love to finally play piano for you.
Sounds great. Who's the guy who married a kid and then later on killed his wife?
This is just what she's been saying she wanted: to spend time with her dad and for him to love her.
The point is, Chris's grades aren't improving, and just yesterday, he caused a little ruckus in his history class.
We here feel that the best solution is for Chris to attend something called vocational school.
Um, your show went off the air and you died 30 years ago, so that phrase means very little to me.
That's right, Chris. This family's never shied away from a new challenge, like when I was the spokesman for that perfume, Deschanel Number Five.
Wow. This is way better than that barber school I went to where I couldn't stop pumping the chair.
That's right, you'll be strutting down Spooner Street in this dental floss macaroni necklace made with Oral-B dental floss and Pasta Barilla.
I don't know, but it's going to be a challenge, like trying to seem sad while you're wearing flip-flops.
The owner of a Geo Tracker with the license plate FLP FLP, you're blocking the funeral procession.
A big part of being a mechanic is being completely shocked when somebody hasn't had a particular item
Me, I like a piece of sourdough on top, piece of sourdough on bottom, and a nice piece of wheat in the middle.
Okay. It's called The Black Duck. The Black Duck. You ever seen a black duck?
I seen a brown duck, a yellow duck, a white duck with a green head.
Hey! If it was such a stupid story, why would it have such a well-rounded protagonist?
All right, if we can't make Meg popular, we can at least find her a boyfriend.
That can wait. I've just looked at some porn, and I need you guys to give me some assisted relief.
Yes, there's literally no one in town sad and desperate enough to date my sister.
Anyway, what is wrong with people that they're so myopic and just preoccupied with their own little lives?
The point is, there's someone out there for everyone if they're just willing to open their eyes and look.
Kevin, before you go through with this, would you consider taking Meg out for a date?
Look, we know you've had a hard road ever since you came home from Iraq.
Well, this could be a chance for you to help someone else who maybe feels as bad inside as you do.
Now, don't let on that we had anything to do with Kevin asking her out.
Principal Shepherd, we came to ask if there's anything we can do to get Chris back in the school.
Stewie, I still don't understand why we have to pretend to work at the restaurant.
Uh, Stewie, before you gave the staff the night off, did you check the reservation book?
But Principal Shepherd won't let you back in, and we don't know what to do.
What do I need school for? Tony Danza never went to school, and he played a guy named Tony on four different TV shows.
It was fine. I'll miss the guys at vocational school, but it is nice to be back where I belong.
The Yule Log Channel just put on another log, and I really like it when the wood goes crack, crack, pop, crack, pop.
Let's go do TV commercial driving meant for a professional driver on a closed course.
For the driver who doesn't like to stop going just because they've run out of road.
Plus, it's a good excuse to put on my winter coat and find items from last year still in the pocket.
Ooh, sticky pennies, a rock-hard Starburst, an appointment card for my next dental appointment that's already come and gone, a ticket stub for a matinee of Interstellar, an unwrapped piece of Dentyne, a yarmulke from when that Jewish guy died, a breath mint from the now-defunct Clorets corporation, printed-out Mapquest directions to Dave & Buster's,
Flintstone vitamin I didn't take 'cause it was Barney, refrigerator magnet from local electrician who is now arrested, and balled up tissues with last year's flu on it.
Meg, it is my duty as a bad father to prove that I can do anything my kids can do.
Yeah, does anybody else in the family have any secret talents we don't know about?
But he did continue edging, bringing himself to the verge of sexual pleasure, only to stop at the last moment.
But her voice-overs were not reasonably priced, so they turned to me, a guy who sounds like Morgan Freeman, but is not, in fact, Morgan Freeman.
Um, I-I'm not really good at public speaking, so I'll just say... farble shlup muckle blop.
You may also know me as the lady who threw a plate of cheese during that city council meeting.
My race isn't for a few days, so we should have plenty of time to hang out.
I'm trying to land you some endorsements, and I have a lead with a very popular IBS medication.
Well, I have to say, you two are the best thing to happen to sports since the New York Knicks finally changed their name.
Hi, I'm pink-eyed Bob Costas, live from our Pyeongchang studios, here to bring you breaking news, and occasionally blink off-synch in an attempt to satisfy my searing eye itchiness.
A U.S. tourist, Peter Griffin, has been apprehended by North Korea and is being held prisoner for what I'm being told is trespassing and doing that thing with your eyes that makes you look Chinese.
They say if you get a job doing what you love, you never work a day in your life.
And once I get 'em on the run, I'm gonna keep 'em on the run.
Wait, before you kill me, can you at least give me an extra bullet so I can pretend to catch one in my teeth?
Well, I realized that it wasn't worth doing if you guys weren't there with me.
You may not have won a gold medal in the games, but you won one in our hearts.
I don't know, I'm thinking maybe we can hang out a little bit longer, see what else Korea has to offer... Uh-oh.
Fortunately, tensions caused by this international incident were resolved by the steady hand of Dennis Rodman, who let Kim Jong-un win in a one-on-one basketball game against him, continuously saying, Oop, you got me, in a way that was just convincing enough for Kim to believe.
I can dig it, he can dig it, she can dig it, we can dig it
After my weekend job as a zookeeper with very muscular thighs. Thigh there, nice to see you all.
Okay, Chris, now, if you're gonna learn how to mow a lawn, the first lesson is that you always start by 7:00 a.m., before everyone wakes up, including roosters.
Now, to start the mower, you grab this pull cord like so and give it a nice hard yank.
What's going on, guys? I'm Corey, here to take your lawn mowing skills to the next lev.
He disappeared, and now there's this guy doing ISIS videos and they think it's Corey.
This is Corey, here to talk about making a dirty bomb with stuff you can find in your kitchen.
Oh, Admiral, you've been so good to me these past weeks, with my husband gone and me alone to tend to his massive estate.
Plus, helping you helps me forget my own country's troubles and my struggle to save our national flower, the Masdevallia orchid.
The secret, however, is to October in Zurich but in September, to avoid the obnoxious Octobering crowds, saving October for Paris... Novembering there...
Then Decembering in Palm Beach in November and, in December, Januarying, of course, as always, in Gstaad.
It means a lot from a man whose top hat looks suspiciously like an Amazon Echo with a cardboard brim.
Uh, I don't know if you've noticed, but the sun's been up for, like, an hour.
But, Mr. Herbert, you always made the cookies with the large pill in the center for me.
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but my husband is feeling ill and stepped into the men's locker room.
You most certainly do not. I don't even think we're going to give you the dance you rehearsed.
And yet two fellows like us with loose lips could cause it all to fall apart.
Look, there's plenty of money to go around, and I don't know how much more of this I can take, so I'll make a deal with you guys.
If you can help me wrap this up, if you know what I mean... Take her skydiving, something that might, you know, overwhelm her elderly heart...
Listen, I-I know there's been some bad blood between us, but I-I promise, it won't happen again.
Webster's defines class as a group of students gathered at a pre-ordained time for the purposes of education.
But at least Angela died doing what she loved: swimming less than 20 minutes after she had eaten.
She may be gone, but her voice will live on in DVD and Hulu Plus and tiny droid-projected messages.
Look for us in the low-trafficked corner of Macy's between Eddie Bauer and the never-bought male jewelry.
We're splitting the job because one of the shareholders' favorite songs was Ebony and Ivory, so here we are.
Now we know it's difficult to remember two new names, so to make things easier,
So, Peter, we've been tasked with making the operations around here run more efficiently, and part of that will involve reassigning people based on their abilities.
So we're gonna put a flag on you, and wherever you go, people will know that's where they put their recyclables.
Well, at least make sure all the liquids are gone, please, before you throw them.
But due to man's excessive use of fossil fuels, climate change had rendered the iceberg nothing more than a small cube.
Well, how do you know I wasn't telling my wife a story and you're a figment of my imagination?
We need you to taste test our new varieties of seasonal beers, which will be coming down this conveyor belt.
Also, our delivery truck drivers have to pass an annual drug test, so we'll need you to collect their urine samples.
They'll be coming down this same conveyor belt in similarly colored cups, which you will need to place on this tray.
Yeah, our customers find a 300-year-old mascot hard to relate to, they want a regular guy.
Ew, yes, but also, that's exactly the kind of customer we should be appealing to.
Ladies and gentlemen, throwing out today's ceremonial first pitch, the face of the Pawtucket Patriot Brewery,
Hey, guys, I'm Billy on the Street, and I'm here with one of the biggest mascots
Okay, we're gonna go up to people and give a dollar to everyone who recognizes you. Let's go.
And the other day, I even got to hang out with a bunch of other famous mascots.
That's right. Your character's so popular, you're gonna have a balloon in the annual Quahog Parade!
Imagine how much they'd love to know he has a funny sidekick dog who drinks with him.
It's our pleasure to introduce Pawtucket Pat and his new sidekick Hops McElaney, the Alcoholic Dog. Come on, y'all!
Pat. I was up on the roof because you told me drinks were on the house.
Guys, from now on, I need to stand this up in the middle of your table.
I doubt any of you can begin to know what it's like to ride someone's coattails, to play second fiddle to some fat idiot, to constantly be setting up someone else's...
Tom, I'm standing here outside some public toilets where dads who are really hurting will be vomiting in front of their still-developing children.
The parade is tomorrow, but already the giant balloons are being inflated including two newcomers this year:
In fact, Hops is so popular that hundreds of Quahog women have volunteered to blow up his balloon.
And here comes the marching band, led by baton twirler Jane Duncan, whose aunt is famously-thin actress Bebe Neuwirth.
You know, part of me is glad Sarah met Henry, because she and I had a pact that if neither of us was married by 40, we'd get hitched.
Tom, I'm standing here along the parade route where the Hops balloon has just been punctured, and is now raining helium
You plug in your address, and it gives you an estimate of what your house is worth.
Yeah, it says... it says, in the '60s, some woman named Doris Billingsly died in my house.
Not much. I wanted to know if you're gonna go to the dance on Friday.
Okay, guys, now, the murder took place down here in the basement, so it's probably our best shot at finding something.
I got scared and tried to run through the wall, leaving a hole shaped like me.
Actually, Brian and I are taking a survey, and we wanted to see if you had a few minutes.
Sometimes I pretend I'm at the security desk at the mall and everyone at the mall is banging each other.
I'm taking this, and we are gonna help you start thinking about sex like a normal teenager.
Okay, guys, now, I thought we could try to find the ghost by doing the movie Flatliners.
All right, Chris, it's gonna take a few steps to get you off hard-core porn.
Using the bathroom. Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop 'em from dunking in the water?
Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop them from dunking in the water?
I fix my car in slow motion in an ad for a supplemental blood thinner.
I took Zanbrex for over 15 years, till I learned the benefits of once-daily Sanguelto, a latest-generation blood thinner.
When I'm at a multiracial picnic for some reason, the last thing I want to do is have a stroke.
I can eat potato salad with chuckling strangers with the confidence of someone who knows he's 12% less likely to suffer a stroke recurrence.
Thanks to Sanguelto, I can snuggle with my age-appropriate wife on a blanket underneath non-holiday-related fireworks.
I left her for six weeks back in 2009, only to realize I was already too old to bed the type of women that would make such a separation worth it.
So, here we are, grinding it out till onef us has that second stroke that you don't come back from.
Well, a lot of kids' first foray into sex is looking at someone else's porn stash.
So, here's a stack of water-stained Playboys that I found in a locker at the town pool bathroom.
See, you look at them, and then your brain sort of creates a scene for you.
I think we should all go investigate the still-unsolved murder of Doris Billingsly, who never did anything but overcook one dinner in March of 1962.
I hate to be a bother, but do you... do you know if I'll be receiving a rose?
I believe something's gonna happen that will put me out of contention for a rose.
Would you excuse me while I step into another room and celebrate like a girl in a Rom-com who just got good news?
If taking Sanguelto, please refrain from dancing like in a Rom-com, as nosebleeds may be permanent.
And remember, most drugs are prescribed to you because a hot girl with a rolling suitcase gave your doctor a free pen.
You have a responsibility as a member of the press to report the news accurately.
When I was young, seeing these half-naked mannequins was all I needed to get me going.
And The Middle is a show that was inexplicably on ABC for a very long time.
Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when a person has a birthmark on their face.
Sure. And for sure this is a real date, and me and the popular kids aren't gonna thrill-kill you tonight.
Peter, fake news is a real problem in this country right now, and I really don't want my husband contributing to it.
I guess I just like all the attention that came along with having white hair.
Okay, Peter, your main job here is to go in rooms before me to make sure there's no static electricity.
And I hope you saved your appetite, because, later, we're all wiping our ass with the Constitution.
Folks, to drink this evening, we've got red wine, white wine, and a fifth of bourbon.
Tell those kids, if they ever want to see their parents again, they'll make the shoes!
My husband is the son of a felon who went to prison for blackmailing his brother-in-law by entrapping him with a prostitute and then mailing a copy of the tape to his own sister!
Sometimes I wish I could meet someone else whose dad is a fat idiot who once had a hit television show and who, over time, has worn out his welcome.
Meg, I think you'd look amazing in my brand of lifestyle products that are designed to represent a poor person's idea of what a rich person would wear.
When I'm done with you, you'll be pretty enough to marry an Orthodox Jewish son of a felon who's too stupid to get into Harvard the normal way.
And now look at me, with the winner of the 46th-largest electoral college victory of all time.
And, I got to say, I'm a huge fan of your board game and your beef products and your fraudulent university and...
My darling Bess, tonight, I'm going to drop the Big One onto your Pacific theater.
You want me to just throw away in one day what I've spent a whole day trying to build?
Meg, you expect us to believe that the president of the United States would grab a woman by her (BLEEP)?
I wake up with an erection, but never when she's in the bed with me!
Oh. Well, if this lumpy orange garbage vegetable is here, then where's President Donald Trump?
When you walked through that door, you insulted Bob's Burgers and the hundreds of people who work there.
Anyway, my point is, if Peter Griffin gets to be a jerk all the time, then why can't Donald Trump?
It's a great story. I married a girl who I'd raised since the time she was 11 years old.
We now return to Pirates of the Caribbean, where the sound guy put the microphone too close to Johnny Depp's jangling bracelets.
This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
We are done being mean and insulting, like Donald Trump is. From now on, this family's gonna be nice and supportive.
Oh. So if we're being nice now, maybe you have nice things to say to me, Dad.
Many children have learned their favorite Jewish, black and gay jokes by watching your show over the years.
I haven't had the chance to ask the president if he is fighting with Peter Griffin.
Why are we so damn divided, America? ...making Neil Armstrong the first man to walk on the Moon.
Who knows, maybe someone listening to this might be the first chicken to walk on the Moon.
I was just kayakin' past, and it looked like you guys could use some help.
He touched my daughter, but I punched him, like, a hundred times, so we're fine now.
If you want to learn more about our president, consult the steele dossier, which is all about getting peed on.
He also, with whole heart and full throat, endorsed a pedophile for the United States Senate.
Coming up, we interview a man who went a whole Hawaiian vacation without giving a hang loose sign in a picture, and also didn't do the lei joke.
We bought you a cake with the groceries, so it got smashed with a jug of Tide in the car.
I don't know, my-my birthday is just... it's kind of a reminder that I'm now one year closer to death, with nothing to show for my time here.
And, uh, to your left, you'll see a joke about Allison Janney being very, very tall.
Uh, she has an Oscar, and we have a great deal of respect for her.
But deep down, I was disappointed that we took a shot at Allison Janney, just because she can dunk a basketball.
I mean, she has an Oscar, and we have a great deal of respect for her.
It's not uncommon for an author to dedicate his book to his hero, who you have listed as...
He's also got an interchangeable memory bank, an expandable encyclopedia database, and, as a bonus, the new U2 album.
Not just a robot version, Brian, it's like another you, uploaded with your genetic code, your cognitive patterns, and your entire life story. Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke, and now we are stuck in the history past.
That'll go away. He will evolve as he gathers more and more data. Fire hydrants, images. Fire hydrants, news. Fire hydrants, near me.
Oh, he's also been uploaded with your Internet search history. Yahoo Answers: Is Anton Yelchin's jeep for sale?
It's legitimate memorabilia! Applebee's, Brittany, Quahog. Brittany, Applebee's waitress, blonde. Quahog, Applebee's, Brittany, who is. Blonde waitress, Brittany, Quahog, Applebee's. Brittany Babbit, home address.
Oh, you know, at Applebee's, she's all like, Hi, may I take your order? and at her bedroom window, she's all like, Ah, get out of here.
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want me showing up at your house, don't put a smiley face on my receipt.
Logging in and logging out... wow, there's a lot of computer things that sound dirty.
Hey, did you get the license plate of that handsome guy who ran me over last night?
Okay, lay out the pieces, find the cockpit, open the glue, take a sniff  and this will be my life now.
No way. You should've thought of that before you committed a victimless crime between consenting adults in a commercial arrangement which also created jobs and contributed tax dollars to the community.
No, nothing, you just made a weird noise after you took that sip of water.
I think I know how to take a sip of water without sounding like a rock concert drum solo.
So the plan is, we trick him into coming in and getting an erotic massage.
Well, tempted as I may be, there is no way I'm going in there for a massage.
Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe, we got pictures of you getting a sexual favor a while back, so now you got to drop the charges.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
And I needed to show you that no one wants to read your autobiography, not even you.
Because your best is middling, your worst is intolerable, and when you die, the most you'll want written about you is He Was a Good Boy on your tombstone.
We now return to The Talking Talking Dead, the show that talks about the show that talks about The Walking Dead.
It was awesome. Oh, my God, it was so great how they thought that other show was so great.
Yeah, totally. And that one part of the show where the guy was talking about that one part of the other show and how he didn't see that coming?
I need an aftershow after this aftershow, just to know what I just saw about what I just saw about what I just saw.
But it all just goes to show that basically every licensed massage therapist in this country is a prostitute.
Oh, yeah. You can pretty much do whatever you want with any masseuse ever, because they're all prostitutes.
If you're ever seeing, like, a physical therapist, or doing yoga with a private instructor?
For you, Lois. I did it to earn enough money to buy a comb for your beautiful hair.
In honor of opening day at Fenway Park this weekend, the Red Sox are offering four tickets behind home plate to the person who makes the best Red Sox ad.
I am not a subtle filmmaker, and my audience wouldn't have it any other way.
They ran out of those mini batting helmets, so they're serving it in athletic cups.
Yeah, come to think of it, he did have a friend filming, and he made me eat the first seven bites in front of him, and he didn't charge me anything.
All right, now to have the only exciting thing in the game happen as soon as I turn my back.
Yeah, it's all the way to that guy with the scorebook just waiting for someone to talk to.
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a big Boston welcome to Peter Griffin, the fist transgender Red Sox fan.
Good morning, Peter. We saw the game last night, and, well, we just want you to know that we wholeheartedly support all transgender people.
Peter, before you say anything that might clear all this up, let me tell you about our stellar transgender employee benefit package.
Well, as such, you're entitled to supplemental time off, our on-site masseuse and a $60 gift card from Nordstrom Rack.
Well, in the words of trailblazer Caitlyn Jenner, I will do anything for money and attention.
I would find out later that when you put your ass in wet cement, you're just sealing it shut forever.
Best they could do was poke holes in it so it comes out like Play-Doh spaghetti.
Peter, pretending to be transgender to get time off work trivializes a real struggle in this country.
Besides the fact that you're lying to your employers, you're taking advantage of a civil liberty that so many oppressed people have fought their entire lives for.
No, of course not. That's the first thing everyone thinks of when they see you.
Oh, I forgot to mention, one of you guys has to be in charge of changing my diaper the whole trip.
Actually, I've been observing all of you for the past few hours, and I choose Quagmire.
Well, I'll turn to you, very sincerely, and I'll look you right in your eyes, and I'll say, Quagmire, I've got poopies.
Now you just take that beautiful hair down to the salon, and you'll be a ten.
Now that I'm living as a woman, I can say whatever I want to men and they can't hit me.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm the one who planted the evidence that got you suspended.
Now, Peter, one of the perks of being a woman is that you get to go out and have a white wine, squeak-fart lunch with your friends.
Well, you went into a coma after you were hit in the head by a fan.
And since the company was paying for your medical care anyway, we fulfilled your letter of medical intent for your sex reassignment surgery.
That's right, but now that it's done, maybe I can help you with the transition.
Mom, you know, our world today is filled with people like Dad trying to find their identities.
Whether it's cutters, or people who cut themselves, or people who drag knives across their thighs to feel something.
I guess we'll just have to deal with this, like when Chris won that hundred-dollar scratcher and talked down to everybody.
It would take another eight years before I summoned the courage to kiss him at a backyard barbecue, and from that moment on...
Thank you for showing me the 90 things women have to do before going to bed.
You can just read on an impossibly bright iPad while I toss and turn in a pissy way.
Hey, now that we're all settled at this table, you guys want to move outside 'cause it's such a nice day?
Okay, why don't you go save us a table outside, and we'll be there soon?
Your friends left the minute you came out here, and they didn't pay their indoor tab.
I was already at the end of a long journey to find the courage to become a woman.
I grew up in the small town of Football, Texas, and from the age of eight, I was mercilessly teased for being different and dressing funny.
I became a war hero and raised a family, but I was dying inside, and the deeper I buried it, the more unhappy I became, and eventually, I even thought of ending my own life.
I kind of stumbled into all this, but you've been dealing with it your whole life.
And my story, to one degree or another, is every transgender person's story, and all those stories are the price of admission to finally feeling at peace with who you are...
I kind of feel like this is less of a crossover and more of a roast.
Well, I guess it's my turn. Louise lowered her velvet hood, letting loose her flowing red hair. Ignoring her friends' obvious and understandable envy, she confidently approached the mysterious castle. The doors blew open, as if some magical force had been expecting her. Louise belonged here, if only because this is where Horatio called home. Then, through the vegetation, and past the mist that sprinkled her heaving bosom, she saw him. Horatio, with his long, flowing hair blowing in the breeze, his cape fluttering. He had only two loves in his life: his horses and Louise's heaving bosom. He grabbed her tighter than she'd ever been held before. A way in which her husband, Paulter, had not held her since before they were married. Horatio then took Louise by the hand, leading her out to his stables as her bosom heaved. Louise's mind was racing in anticipation of the dirty hay sex that was gonna most definitely happen. As the two lovers entangled into one atop the probably peed-on hay, Louise's bosom heaved. They spent the next 18 minutes fighting off sneezes, in the throes of ecstasy.
Yes, I'd like to enroll in a couple of classes so I can have sex with girls not old enough to get into bars.
Peter, you caused millions of dollars' worth of water damage, all because you couldn't make it up the stairs.
I haven't been this embarrassed since I forgot about the silent part in George Michael's Faith.
Lois is writing a romance novel about a woman who is unhappy with her husband and begins to have a torrid affair with a caped lover who has horses.
Well, the costs are meager when you're able to dominate and control the beast with just... the slightest glance.
Anyway, I've been speaking to my horse in the silent language of knowing, and I...
Do regular gyms have open garage doors where members' large dogs can charge innocent civilians?
Yeah, no, it's, like, uh... like, probably one of the worst things you can eat.
I thought we were gonna get a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream with all the millennials who can afford ten-dollar scoops of ice cream but can't afford to move out of their parents' house.
We are. But first I need to pick up this wine that Lois mentioned in her story.
Where's that part about the wine? The doors magically opened. Chill came over her. Through the vegetation. Light mist.
I thought it was the pig guys, but, you know what, it was the bread.
I lied! I just want to be free, like a recently divorced man with no kids!
I mean, do-do you think Lois could be having an affair with this Horatio guy?
Oh, my God, Stewie, she's going to the store and won't be back until tonight?
All right, Peter, now, I know you haven't eaten in a while, so this is something called the Pocket Diet.
I thought that you wrote everything you were looking for in a lover, and, if I could embody some of those things, maybe I would have a shot with you.
But then I found out Horatio is real, and-and I couldn't bear to see you do something like this to the family.
Then, thinking I was revealing all my most intimate wants and desires, you thought that you could exploit what you read to seduce me?
But when you thought I might be cheating with someone other than yourself, you found that, and only that, morally objectionable?
That's why I wrote it in a story, because I knew that I would never act on it.
Ugh. I never thought a dog could be such a genuine piece of human garbage.
I feel a little sheepish to get so fooled by a silly little book that Lois wrote.
Yes, but, you know, I think what we missed in all of this is that Lois wrote a beginning, middle, and end to something.
Well, nothing, but, you know, I think-I think any writer knows how hard it is to be staring at that blank page.
All right, now let's go miss the urinal with half a whiz and get out of here.
My stomach is starting to sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger gasping for air at the end of Total Recall.
Tonight, we pass around Stifler's mom, and in the morning, it's off to die quick in Vietnam.
I dragged this piece of dirty cardboard in from the alley to show y'all how to get down.
I mean, like, there was palm trees like it was Hawaii, but then there was a suit of armor in the corner.
Oh, gosh, she was, she was just so... word on the bottom of your coffee cup.
I just have some great memories of her... numbers to call in case of emergency or accidental poisoning.
I have an extra bedroom, and the bed has a bunch of different-sized pillows on it.
You don't even need a college degree, which is a very scary true fact. Go ahead.
Hey, Dad, I just checked the weather, and it looks like sunny skies all weekend.
Billy Finn, John Travolta from one of our cutaways, uh, all of our characters as Star Wars characters, everybody from The Cleveland Show,
Cherry Chevapravatdumrong... that's how that name is pronounced... the Orville... the ship, not the cast... um, me... Aw, damn it!
And the first event, worth five points, is a race down to the lake right now!
What Meg didn't know, what none of them knew, is that I already was a stinky poo-poo egg.
First, I throw a rope over this tree limb, put the noose around my neck.
Now I'll just step onto this rock and jump off into the sweet relief of death.
We're just two dads bonding with our daughters, and getting lost is not part of the plan.
We're not lost! We're just... two dads in the woods, who love our daughters very, very much.
I mean, if it was, Oh, What a Knight with a K, that would've made some sense,
Damn it, I just want to be home, not here, lost in the woods, looking at this stupid map with a magnifying glass.
Wow, Peter, that was a close call with that fire, but I'm glad you all made it back safe and sound.
I'm Peter Griffin, joined by my wife Lois, our dog Brian, and our children, Meg, Stewie and Chris.
Have you ever been at your grandmother's house and you look at her weird, old computer, and there's, like, a crack on the side of it?
Winona Ryder kind of hung out on set all day, and it, uh, wore a little thin on all of us.
Yeah, the network doesn't like us using the names of actual companies on the show.
Kids, time to gather up our old cords and chargers that no longer work and throw them in the garbage.
Don't you know a lot of discarded electronics end up in the ocean and kill sea turtles?
You know, I actually had a couple of ad-libs about Chinese working conditions that somehow didn't make it into the final cut.
Peter, I'm just not sure it's such a great idea that everyone in the family got a new cell phone.
This is why we need a Sharpie in here to put our names on our water!
You know, for an extra $12 a month, you can insure your screen, and they'll replace it for free.
You talked over the setup of this cutaway, and now we don't know what's going on.
Oh, I remember. They're all skanks. Getting new phones was a worse idea than a skank robbery.
But instead, I packed my Bibles and my Tootsie Pops and headed down to Quahog.
A place where people farm their own food, make their own clothing and read books...
Oh, come on, Lois, you only want to go to Old Sturbridge Village 'cause you once got hand-blasted there on a field trip.
You can explain to me why my husband makes four times as much money as I do.
Mr. Griffin was able to negotiate a higher salary because he's still paying alimony to his first wife. First wife? What?
Not for real, though. For real, she's actually coming into the booth right now to be part of this commentary.
That's okay. It seems just like when I would do ADR for American Horror Story, for which I have received five Emmy nominations.
Okay, I need you to file these and not be working with a shampoo Mohawk.
I also won an Emmy for my performance as Marcia Clark in The People vs. O.J. Simpson.
Stewie, I'm gonna give you another crack at that, because I believe what you meant to call them was baluster slats, not banister slats. Banister, baluster. Same thing.
PETER: I'll tell you what it is: an homage to a classic song from The Muppet Show, sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.
Well, if we're being honest, Lois, you're really bad at having sex when I'm drunk.
These montage-style cutaway gags provide the animators the freedom to go beyond the page, as we say.
Enjoy spending the rest of your life alone, and enjoy doing the show without me, 'cause I quit! building a chair with my male friends.
If you're just joining us, Lois has stormed out and announced that she's quitting the show after learning that Peter and Sarah Paulson were once married.
Hey, remember the one day that guy who plays the burglar was on set, he was passing out postcards for his one-man show?
If I'm not real, then why does a fat nerd pretend to be me at every Comic-Con?
Wait a second. If Dad's not real, then he's not really my dad, which means I'm not real?
Um, Ms. Kunis, I would just like you to know that I have no problem with you breastfeeding in this booth.
Oh, Seth, since you're here, would you mind recording episodes 17, 14, 15, 16, and an NFL on Fox promo?
Well, the captain of the Orville says that none of us are real... We're all cartoon characters.
Are you saying the rough-edged comedy manager from The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel does my voice?
Peter, I-I'm not even sure what this means, but it sure makes it seem less important how much money you make compared to me or that maybe you neglected to tell me everything about your past.
Peter, you can drink as much as you want, and nothing bad will ever happen.
Stewie, you get to travel through time and do things no baby could ever do.
And, Brian, you've had sex with more hot women than a real dog could ever reasonably expect.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need all the real actors to form a human shield around me so I can get out of the building without the American Dad people seeing me.
Wiped out by the German aphid, which was oddly brought by the Swedes during the Great Depression...
Which, for those of you who are too young, was like a decade-long case of the Mondays.
Well, you guys, I guess we all learned something about not letting technology rule our lives.
And, Mom, next time we get baluster slats, let's make sure there's enough room to get our heads out.
Now let's all go around the horn and say what our favorite part of the episode was.
And just so you know, he doesn't drive a Prius like you see on the show.
I'm sure that kind of thing works great for the younger crowd, but I'm 44.
Oh, I was just gonna drive through some puddles and see how long my tracks stay wet.
Boy, I tell ya, no better way to start your day than a morning dump in a neighbor's yard.
Yes, we are in search of a Big Wheel that was erroneously discarded and collected today.
Like one of those kids who gets a device that allows them to hear for the first time.
I'm in love with someone else, and I didn't want to say it with the silly hands.
If it ended up in the ocean, it most likely has traveled to Garbage Island.
The other name for the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, an enormous cluster of man-made debris floating in the middle of the ocean.
STEP ONE: We all go frigging nuts over Yankee Candles, so to help you learn all the flavors, I made a little quiz.
I'm gonna give you a name, and you tell me if it's the name of a Yankee Candle or a porn star.
Will you come and just be nearby to give me tips and help me get through it?
Well, if my reading material has taught me anything, it's just a cloud with lips.
Um, no, uh, no. He, um, he broke, uh... broke the window with his foot.
Another thing I was just thinking about is... AMBER Alert, white Honda Accord, license plate... Uh, uh, I mean,
Yeah, no, what I realized is that all those texts you sent me, they're like my bible now.
You see, I've calculated that, even with both of our weights, it will still be capable of flotation.
My plan is to attach six Jimmy Buffett margarita machines to it, which should be able to propel us home.
O-Okay, I-I don't think I can talk to you, because, right now, you're making less sense than an M.C. Escher floor plan.
Glenn Quagmire, I tried to help you meet a nice woman, but you just couldn't help yourself, could you?
I thought I was helping you find love, and, instead, you used me as a tool to get down every middle-aged woman's pants in town.
I'll buy you a coffee, and... do you like the music of Ray... LaMountain? LaMontagne.
Thank you. Hey, beautiful, you want to take a pointless girl-stride walk and listen to Ray LaMontagne?
I know it's weird to say, but... it's kind of just too perfect for me here.
You're an enormously important part of my life, Brian, and I couldn't bear the thought of losing you.
I assumed it unlikely you'd change your mind, so I added the fans from many, many Dell laptops to the back of my Big Wheel so I could simply tow everyone back to land.
You can throw away just about anything in this world, but you can't throw away a friendship.
Last time I did that, the kids walked in on you looking at Internet corn.
We'll be starting the taping in just a few minutes, but I wanted to come out here personally and say hi to my fans.
Let's welcome our first guest, my colleague at Channel 5 and now a best-selling author,
I came up with it after hiking to the top of Mount Asia and meditating on Epiphany Bridge.
I have to buy this book, read two chapters, then leave it on my nightstand for a year.
She says that when you de-clutter your house, you de-clutter your mind and clear a path to true happiness.
So I want everyone to go through every single item you own, and if it doesn't kindle joy, throw it away.
You remember when she thought the solution was putting a lemon slice in a plain glass of water for a very simple kind of pleasure?
Woody and Buzz, who definitely are not alive, so I can turn my back... on them!
Oh, I don't. I just rolled around in the sand and brought home this bucket of alive crabs.
That your parents pay for entirely, but I get to put the mortgage coupon in the mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that clearly says Not legal tender into the mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while Chris puts a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox while I hold the plastic door open for him?
No problem, Peter. I'm sure Lois'll cool down in a few days, and you'll be back home.
Ha! A clean house means a clean soul, and a clean soul is a happy one.
Clifford big! So they decided to hose him in the yard instead, but Clifford couldn't fit through the door.
I get to sleep with all my stuff in a storage unit on the highway access road.
I tell you to clean your rooms, and the first thing you do is put all your science projects in Stewie's closet?
No, I know the letters when they're on their own, but, you know, when they team up like this,
I'm just, uh... I'm sort of outmatched. It was my fault, not yours. I'm so sorry, and I love you all. Goodbye. P.S. Please throw this note out.
I don't know. Somehow, an idea I got from a two-minute segment on a morning talk show didn't bring me the life satisfaction
On the bright side, our sparse, white living room looks like the John Lennon, Yoko Ono Imagine living room.
Hey, Chris, what's the name of the girl on the end of the couch? I'm sure I've met her before.
Social media? Better swap my glasses for a monocle that will pop out when I'm confronted with modern talk.
Meet disgraced YouTube star Logan Paul and his cool bus, the Golden Throated Homeless Guy and his cool bus he poops in,
And I'm gonna be live and in-person at the Quahog Streaming-Con, where you'll see I'm only five-foot-two.
And remember, that Nazi stuff I said was in the heat of a very competitive Halo game.
And congratulations to Goldblatt69, whose people definitely do not control the media and all banking.
Oh, awesome. Look over there. You can take a selfie in a hospital bed to get social media attention. Don't really want to get into it, but I'm fine.
I'm gonna do a Instagram story here where I insult a loner and it becomes a whole thing.
Now, I don't know if anyone watching this is a lawyer, especially a constitutional lawyer, but...
You know, like, on the back of Triscuits when they give you the recipes for those snacks?
My guest today is a white music writer who has written a book about the history of hip-hop.
And today, I'm gonna show you how anyone can become an Internet celebrity, like me, Corey from Corey's World.
All right, Meg, now that you're an Internet personality, we got to build your brand.
Me too. The moon, though slight, was moon enough to show On every tree a bucket with a lid,
But first, popular Internet star Meg Griffin has Type 2 diabetes, and is also the new face of diabetes drug Pancresta.
If you have a problem with addiction, do not take Pancresta, as smoking Pancresta may mimic the otherworldly high of heroin.
Pancresta can be delivered directly to your home, and since we're here, why not, we'll do a bump.
I'm not sure how it works, but I do know you could go blind, you could have organ failure, you could lose your feet.
James Woods High School will also be saluting their own diabetic Internet celebrity with a pep rally in her honor this Thursday.
Sponsored by Pancresta, which feels like being inside the warm, wet mouth of the Lord.
I'm not a Hummer guy, Stewie. I'm a responsible Prius driver who's making the best of a bad situation.
Refrigerator Meg here having one of my favorite snacks: french fry sandwiches on white bread.
I have a gift for knowing when something bad happens to someone's legs, kind of like a shining.
Well, let's see... I drive about 4,000 a year, so when this car goes, I'll be...
She passed away last month. She was addicted to Pancresta, so she didn't so much pass away as elevate to a higher level of consciousness.
If anyone remembered what we look like, it would be shocking how fat we are.
You've inspired us to gain all this weight, and we just wanted to say thanks.
I was gonna take you to prom as part of a cruel bet, but I'm fat now, too!
But from here on, my fridge will be full of fruits, vegetables and lean meats! Yo, yo, yo!
Brian and Stewie got thrown into New Hampshire by the Hulk, and you're a beam of light.
I want to squeeze your butt and then take your pants down and look at your butt!
The only thing that's left to do now is for you to pay the normal $1,000 principal meeting fee.
Anyway, great idea. We'll have a ceremony to change the name of the school this week.
We will start today's ceremony with the traditional to honor our wacky but beloved mayor.
Beautiful. Now, to unveil our new sign, we've invited HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines, who are here to prove that their show didn't ruin their marriage.
Do you need me to walk you to your car in case the studio audience guy shows up?
It showed real leadership, and I think you should be the next mayor of Quahog.
Of course he did. He was vice president, and before that, a United States senator.
Welcome back, Quahog. And now it's time for a new segment on our show called On the Same Sofa, in which a guest and I have a conversation while sitting on the same sofa.
Well, we've now reached the middle of the interview, where I ask the guest, How's the sofa so far?
You know that's a guy who's roughly led his wife out of parties by the elbow.
Yeah, but either way, he's that Little League coach the parents hope their kids don't get.
The inside trader who kills himself the day his prison sentence is supposed to start.
The only thing I'm afraid of are fire truck sirens and things that look like faces.
Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker, and I will be your moderator for tonight's mayoral debate.
Not because I want to, but because it counts as community service for open-hand smacking an Uber Eats guy.
First question: as candidates for mayor, how do I put my apps into a folder?
It's irresponsible for the town to get two credit cards and just swap the balance back and forth each month.
Let's cut the crap. The only reason you're running is... to make me look ridiculous.
And I am not just some idiot to be laughed at and not taken seriously.
And sometimes it's, like, kids making the pancakes, and-and you get these mondo huge ones.
Like I'm good company, and I'm smart and funny, and I'm invited to all your pool parties.
I'm not gonna say something I don't mean just because your ego needs to hear it.
Regardless of what we think of each other, this is no way for us to die.
I can't believe they canceled the election after they thought Brian and Mr. Quagmire were dead.
The Internet pretty much only lets us fire white males, so if you're not a white male, you're safe.
It used to happen a lot in the '70s but doesn't seem to happen that much anymore. to a bygone era when men settled their differences
Come to think of it, but I don't remember seeing a few short hairs in my ice cubes
Do you remember if you put your wrist to your forehead like a nancy-boy when you fainted?
I got to say, Peter, I had reservations about this cruise, but you do seem more relaxed.
I knew this was a possibility, so I put a 1982 Mattel Electronic Baseball game in your bag.
Well, it's not my fault you guys are too stupid to understand what the plan was.
Hi there, do you know if singer and songwriter Bob Welch is on board yet?
Okay, for the first game, I choose Alan Parsons as my teammate, but not The Project.
Why do you always want to hang out with other people when we're on vacation?
Well, I feel like this has become a referendum on me, and I don't appreciate it.
You want to mess around on some damp towels next to where the seagulls crap?
Wow, I've never seen someone eat so many powdered Donettes in half an hour before.
I think the only way to teach you a lesson is to dog-shake and get you all wet.
Well, we found the thinnest part of the hull, but it's still an inch thick.
Coming in at number seven on the countdown, that was Peter Griffin with Yacht Rocky, down three spots.
She writes, Dear Casey, is Christopher Cross as nice as he seems? Also, aren't you dead? And why did your large wife hide your body from your children?
This Sunday, we turn the Quahog Convention Center into a mud pit for the 28th annual Quahog Monster Truck Rally and gun show.
Watch real loud trucks and smell the smoke that reminds you of your dead alcoholic stepdad who you're glad is dead but still miss anyway.
You will not be the fattest person there, and if you are, get that shirt off!
It's all happening at the Quahog Convention Center, so hold in all your farts till this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
Oh, oh, I got one. Big Tic Tac, so you don't have to eat so many little Tic Tacs.
Oh, this must have been when we were jumping around to Jump Around, like the song asked us to.
No, no, I mean-I mean it's difficult to watch your son embarrass himself so publicly.
Sometimes you want to shake 'em by the shoulders and say, Aah, what are you doing?
But you just got to give 'em the biggest hug you can and let 'em know that you'll always be there for them.
As much as you want to save your kids from their mistakes, it's their mistakes that help them grow and change and become their best selves.
Yep, here I am, Mr. Wisdom, sitting at the bottom of a bottle, just like every Tuesday.
Except for a job and your own home, you are the full package, Brian Griffin.
Well, I guess we'll pretend this never happened, and I'll see you in another two years.
Table 13. The fish is for the gentleman, and the chicken is for the lady.
Because I made you lie down in the back seat all the way here? You looked tired.
It just seems like you're always taking me to out-of-the-way places to avoid being seen together.
The fish is for me. And the chicken... the chicken is for my girlfriend, Ida Davis. Girlfriend? Are you sure, Brian?
Like, I know Brian was squeamish about sleeping with a trans woman before, but it's 2019 now.
There are many things I can't go into at this time, but I can confirm that a body was removed from Waldo's apartment this morning.
But to that point, instead of always asking Where's Waldo? maybe some of you should've been asking How's Waldo?
Listen, Glenn, I know this is an adjustment for you, and you and Brian haven't always seen eye to eye.
You know, Glenn, Brian thought you two could hang out this afternoon, and I think that's a great idea.
Come on, Glenn. If I'm gonna be dating your mom, it's important that we spend some time together.
Brian, don't bring up a reference to someone whose favorite movie it is, because you'll just embarrass yourself.
You think this moon rock is gonna walk across the room and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams playing Teddy Roosevelt, God rest both their souls?
Okay, I'm gonna call the plays while I'm covering my mouth with this play card.
Listen, Dad, the first time you hooked up with Brian, it was awful, I hated it.
But you were confused, you'd just gone through a huge change, you didn't know if you had any options, so you settled.
Why in God almighty would you choose him? Because I love him, a resolved Ida said.
But as special as you are to me, I have to put my son first.
Quagmire, we agreed that it was a two-hand touch, and then Chris hit me with one hand, and I said that didn't count, but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.
So I drilled him in the head with the ball, and now he's not moving.
Damn it, Griffin, you've been staring at that menu for five minutes, and you peed your pants.
Peter, I spoke with my parents, and we can live with them until our house is fixed.
Hey, kids, how would you like to hear this on the screen instead of the great show you came to see?
Please cooperate and do your part in keeping this theater quiet, so everyone, including you, can enjoy it.
Those asked to leave today will be refused admission to this theater in the future.
No more bets. The money that could have gone to your kids is gone. No more bets.
And guy walks quickly away from table without a word, replaced by an older white man with a much younger black woman.
Lois, why do you always start talking like a snob when you're around your parents?
You kids are too young to remember that, but your parents are gonna hate it.
You may think I've always been a part of this high-society world, but I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
I just had to act that way to impress Carter, who cared about that stuff.
Oh, sometimes I feel trapped in this world, forever trying to live up to everyone else's expectations, especially Carter's.
Well, Brian, I've studied pie-making, and the key is to find the absolute freshest ingredients.
I used to come down to this boardwalk and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets to the seagulls.
Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois and my stupid mother-in-law, but you got to come home.
Listen, Carter, unless you want to lose Babs forever, you better get down to Weekapaug.
If you want to win her back, maybe, for once, you try to fit into her world.
Maybe someday you can come by my store and have all the cake you want.
Carter, I appreciate you trying to be the man I want, but being back home here has made me realize you already are.
I thought I wanted this life back, but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best?
Delicious beer, but, still, ours is the life I want, and you are the man I want.
Well, I didn't pay for my beer, but I left a hell of a tip.
Damn it, Griffin! You've been staring at that menu for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting in a double pee puddle!
My name is Von Jiener, and I'm Vice President of Creative Bankruptcy for the Fox TV network, which, at the time of this writing, is still a thing that exists.
You have been selected to be part of a focus group that could affect one of America's most beloved television shows: Family Guy.
And since Fox is now owned by Disney, which will someday be owned by Netflix, which will someday be owned by Pornhub, we have decided that Family Guy is ready for a reboot.
You know, I just want to say again that you were totally right last night to bring up that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.
And please feel free to bring it up again anytime, even if we're talking about something completely unrelated.
Yeah, we're network TV gay, so all we can do is adopt children and pucker-kiss, no tongue stuff.
Well, I'm off to my high-powered job at a fashion magazine, greeting card company or winery.
Great. I worked out, made dinner, a little family time, and had Peter's ankles up in the air by 11:00.
I found a pouch of Big League Chew earlier, and my jaw is worn out.
Would you like me to put on our sleep ocean noises with an occasional shocking seagull screech?
Now, I know you're all wondering who is going to get the big promotion, and I'm proud to announce that person is Smarmy...
And please keep in mind that your spontaneous comments will affect the jobs of hundreds of people.
The show is from a woman's perspective, but it still felt like it was written by a man.
You just need to have grown up in the '80s but still be a teenager.
So, based on that one episode featuring Lois, how many of you would likely watch a second?
Many recent shows have found success by rebooting themselves as gritty supernatural teen dramas, like Teen Wolf or Riverdale, which are watched by as many as 6,000 people a year, so we thought a similar approach might work for Family Guy.
Also, I'm the town sheriff, but you don't find that out till later because it's not relevant to the story.
I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into and listen to a band that's on a label owned by the same parent company as the network.
We've been asked to nod our heads while the band plays the song our parent company is aggressively marketing.
You guys, check it out. Patty just got into the college for people with bright futures.
Yep. I think she's the one kid who's gonna get out of this sexy town.
Now one of us will become a breakout movie star and leave the series, wrecking it for the rest of us.
Okay. And how many of you would watch it if the girls were wearing white shirts and black bras?
What? Course not. And if you're impressed by the size of Alexander Skarsgard's penis, that doesn't make you gay, right?
I know you've been here all day, but it's not like you have jobs to go to, so I'm going to show you one more reboot idea.
Sometimes networks will cancel a show only to reboot it with less-popular characters from the original, while the more-popular actors go on to find greater success in movies or ugly public divorces.
Or should I say, G'day, mate, since you're in Queensland, Australia, where you moved with Brian and Meg after Mom and Dad died?
Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg, and hopefully we can come down there for the season finale.
Chris, I'm standing here in the living room because I need to talk to you about something very important.
You can either continue wearing shoes in the house or continue having sex with this age-defying Eastern physique.
Chris, I'm lying here listening to you toss and turn, and wondering if there's something you'd like to discuss.
I don't know. It's just, it's been so hard since Mom and Dad died and Joe moved in with all his big band records.
Well, if you're all so smart, what do you want to see in a Family Guy reboot?
Great. Matter of fact, we filmed one back when I was an all-setup- no-punch-line comedian.
Well, NBC hogs all the good sports, so we'll get stuck with the boring ones that the announcers always have to keep apologizing for.
It turns out the executive who ordered it was just a squirrel who snuck into the office.
Yes. But in fairness, it was the same squirrel who green-lit Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the show that challenged the notion that only attractive people can be on television.
You know what, I'm glad, after all that, they let us keep the show the way it was.
She loves to smoke and feels it's not truly a meal unless you serve bread.
They had the Lost Boys of the Sudan standing in for them in gym class.
Yeah, the world's better now that corporations read our most private communications and then sell back at us the very things they've eavesdropped about.
Now with the kids showing a complete lack of morals, well, we may all need to go to Christian family camp.
Well, first, I'm driving through a forest, but it's actually inside, which is weird, right?
And there's all these people in the van who normally wouldn't know each other in real life: my second grade teacher, my mom, Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.
All the kids are yelling at me in German, and I understood them, but I don't speak German.
Then SNL is starting, and I'm clearly in the cast, and I haven't been to any of the rehearsals, and all the cue cards are blank, and that show is all cue cards.
And as long as Brian's got your attention, is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?
I'm taking shorter poops but with longer wipes, and there's always this one little line.
Wikipedia states that Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease spread by exposure to infected cat feces.
They also ring you up on one of those tablets they flip around at you and then glare while you pick from three inflated tip percentages.
Clever news pun, doesn't really work as I haven't yet mentioned the subject of the story... At Quahog's new cat café.
Based on the various public health concerns you raised, the city has decided to shut this establishment down.
We've hardly done anything together since we made that fiber commercial and had to use code words for pooping.
Remember, history says that Jesus does not look like a traditional man from the Middle East, but rather someone who sells raw milk online.
Now that that cat café is gone, I can finally get back to my favorite bar and do some writing.
Well, apparently, due to some recent public health concerns, the city has said that no animals of any kind are allowed in any public establishment.
I figured anyone living alone with 73 cats needs to have a double-XL Minnie Mouse sweatshirt.
Nothing. I'm just sitting here, trying to figure out why we have stupid purple couches.
Y-You'd have no way of knowing this, but I'm actually having a very good hair day.
When my hair gets wet, I tend to look like a frazzled Sandra Bullock from one of her comedies.
So I said, That shirt looks really good on you, and he says, Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me.
It's like, whoa, all I said was I like the shirt, and he has to drop boyfriend like a nuclear bomb?
It is now. Say something nice about me or I'll disappear like a serial killer in a '90s movie.
You know, Vera, I've been so moved by my time here at camp, I wonder if I could perhaps say grace tonight?
Well, Meg, you know Chris is a little bit dumb, and I know you're not particularly popular or beautiful, but you do have a head on your shoulders.
Well... honestly, I just thought that maybe I could put something good in the world for a change.
I just thought if I created something that makes people happy, maybe people would remember me for that.
Oh, she was so mad I dragged her to Christian camp, she ran away to live with a Japanese family.
Good evening, Quahog. Our top story: a local Yankee fan's dream comes true when he's diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
Dad, why don't you tell us how you and Mom fell in love and got married?
Well, it was the 1990s, the decade of Viagra but also Lorena Bobbitt, so it was kind of a yay-boo period for penises.
Not because of my sarcastic zingers but because I liked to take 40 Vicodin a day.
I know, right? You know how I always felt like I was stuck in second gear?
It was cold. You know, there were originally nine friends, but three of 'em died of pneumonia.
We also hung out at our favorite café, Perk Place, where we would all sweat like crazy
Your father and I had dated for a few years, but I didn't know if it was going anywhere.
But the '90s was an exciting time, and we wanted to experience all it had to offer.
Well, I'm glad you agree with me, Quagmire, but that still doesn't address this issue of the order.
Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs with my pinky in front of the mirror.
Peter, quit trying to flirt with that clearly girlfriend of yours and come watch giant box TV with us!
And it was the heyday of the multi-camera sitcom, and Paul Reiser, its king, was must-see.
Okay, well, what would you think if I told you that Blossom would completely drop out of show business to get a PhD in neuroscience and then come back and make $15 million a year, while you would work steadily for 20 years, lose all your hair and go bankrupt?
Well, deep down, I knew I loved your father, but I guess I just caved to my father's pressure.
So I decided I was gonna do the most powerful thing you could do in the '90s: make a mixtape.
Again, Peter, it's your mixtape, but you've got Cotton Eye Joe as song number two, number four, seven and eight.
Oh, Peter, I got to say, the fourth and fifth time I heard Cotton Eye Joe, it really got to me.
And I promise it's not part of a ruse to destroy your affection for Peter once and for all.
Not only was Carter letting me marry Lois, but this was gonna be the ultimate bachelor party.
The MTV Beach House was located in the most hepatitis-rich part of Florida, known as Florida.
We partied the same way everyone in the '90s did, spaced apart by a few feet, dancing on our own.
There were these other idiots there having a bachelor party, but I didn't know 'em. They were losers.
I planned to, but then I found a half-eaten hot dog that only had a little bit of sand on it.
You can pretty much wash a hot dog with soap and water, and you can still eat it.
I danced for eight hours straight on The Grind, occasionally going into the pool to pee.
Also, for some reason, I was the only guy a bee was following the whole time.
I'd been eating, or 'cause me and Quagmire were huckin' Capri Suns at each other.
But little did I know, while I was dancing and periodically peeing in the pool,
Carter was orchestrating a plan to destroy my relationship with your mom once and for all.
But then, he came back the next season and scored 30 points in a game where no one would touch him.
And thank you to the entire Brown family, whose last name escapes me at the moment.
Moments late, we'd found a business idea destined to change the tech world forever: Googoogle.
We rented office space, and watching it gave us the idea to rent office space.
We got over our initial differences, and then spent the rest of the day doing what everybody did in the '90s...
Now, listen, we don't have too much time before the wedding, so I want to go over something regarding the father-daughter dance.
We celebrated in grand dot-com bubble fashion: by having an outrageous yacht party with lobster fights and hookers.
We did Ecstasy, which was terrible for you, and only ever made me feel fantastic.
If you hate pure, unconditional love and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe, definitely do not try this drug.
There's also, like, a 90% chance you'll hook up, but really, no, don't do it.
Yeah. I never heard of him before he died, but when he died, it was so sad.
I know I screwed up, and I don't deserve you, but I can't stop thinking about you, day and night.
Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome as the guys your dad wants for you, but I love you more than all of 'em put together.
That's a fact. Just as sure as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy, unmarred by additional canon.
- One by one, members of Lois' family tried to stop me, but I laid 'em out.
We eloped at Fenway Park, which I paid 50 grand to rent out the day before the dot-com bubble burst.
I was having serious regrets about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg, so there was no backing out.
He looks like if Marc Maron had sex with a scarecrow and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.
I always thought he looked like the Cowardly Lion in a suburban white high school production of The Wiz.
But actually, the joke's on us, because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept with a primo roster of '90s tail.
Lois and I are stocking up for a very special anniversary evening, and I'm not sure that five percent discount was worth checking in here on Facebook.
Anyway, to celebrate, we thought it would be fun to recount the three greatest love stories ever told.
We'll begin with the tale of Helen of Troy: The face that launched a thousand ships.
Guys, stop! The Battle of the Greece's Peanut Butter Cup has gone on too long.
Huh, what a pleasantly de-escalating phrase that I'm just now hearing for the first time.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Helen's in my cabin, and I thought I'd give heterosexual sex a try.
But first, in tragedy news: your queen, Helen, has run off with Paris back to Troy.
Isn't he that thinker they keep shuffling around from one philosophy school district to the next?
Have you ever tried wine? Can you keep a secret? You know this is your fault, right?
If we know this distance and this distance, we can calculate this more direct route.
I bet Greeks will always be known for their advancements in math and not as cartoon characters with very hairy arms and a tragically mismanaged economy.
Okay, I had a feeling this fortress would be impenetrable, so I've hired the finest builder in Greece to make us a giant wooden horse.
We'll hide inside it, they'll take it in as a gift, and then we spring out and destroy the city.
Our next love story is Romeo and Juliet, a 500-year-old tale about horny preteens that society somehow decided is classy and not perverted, even though two middle schoolers bang in it. Enjoy.
We got inch-wide masks over just our eyes, with the rest of our faces plainly visible.
I know I ain't supposed to be here, but I just had to see you again.
Juliet, I know we just met, but when I look at you, I feel something special.
Well, I wish you would have told me that before, but that's okay, because I do karate outside against no one.
I'm voiding my bowels right now because I died, not 30 minutes ago in the carriage on the way here.
Oh, Friar Laurence, are you absolutely sure faking my death with this poison is the best plan?
A-And since I'm picking up a prescription, can I, uh, pay for the rest of my items here?
And on top of that, it's that time in late summer before football starts and there's no basketball.
And on top of that, WNBA season is over, and it's still two months till figure skating starts!
For never was a story of more Oh, no! than that of Juliet and her Romeo.
I accidentally farted on a candle at our Eyes Wide Shut party and this happened.
Would you like to dance in silence, because they always add the music in post?
Now, let's have hot sex in silence, and they'll add the sensuous music in post.
Yeah. It's hard not to root for a rich, white lawyer in the Connecticut suburbs.
Judge Forrest.: How did you get this number when they deliver a book that has all the numbers?
Listen, just call your wife on your numbers-on-the-top car phone, and it'll all be better.
If I were you, Dan, I'd just go home and enjoy your family and rabbit.
I better warily approach that pot in silence, knowing they'll add dramatic music in post.
I know. It was awesome at the time, and, frankly, I was real close to getting away with it.
Well, when a man and a woman like each other just a little and they get in an elevator...
But I will say, at least she had a pot of something on the stove when I came home.
I'm gonna do to you what I did to your bunny and your neighbor's cat because I went to the wrong house the first time.
But they did say they'd give me one minute at the end of the show to share my favorite love story.
Of course, I chose the classic romantic tale of the love between a young man and pastry,
The store was all out of apple, so this one is chicken pot, fresh from the oven.
Coming this winter: actors who don't look familiar in shows you're pretty sure you've never heard of on networks you've definitely never heard of.
I just got off the phone with my mom, and all the Pewterschmidts are coming here for Thanksgiving.
'Cause if you hear any argument from anybody who says it isn't stuck, you send them to me, and I will so karate-chop them in the face!
They get a turkey dinner on Quahog and don't have the hassle of hosting their families.
Jail is just a sleeping deputy with keys that can be grabbed by a long broom handle or a mischievous dog.
Okay, if we want to get arrested, the best way to do it is to get caught on the Ring app stealing people's packages.
This sucks. The courts are closed for Thanksgiving, which means we can't even go before a judge till Monday.
You know that old sitcom premise where the kid has two dates to the prom?
How could I possibly have heard of Kal Penn's pen pal Ken in the Cal pen?
And whatever happens, let's make sure we're not goaded into fights by simple playground taunts.
We want fun. We want upbeat. And for our dance, we want You Belong with Me by Taylor Swift.
Me and the Not Cops were watching Die Hard and not commenting on the believability of the police work.
Could John McClane really foil a giant heist outside his jurisdiction, then just walk away and do zero paperwork?
I am now Cleveland J. Roman J. Israel, and I will be wearing wine-colored suits.
As the new white guy in prison, you have to shiv the new black guy.
But I don't want to die. And it would be nice to have people to go to Smash Mouth concerts with.
Come on, there's got to be a way you'll let me in the gang without shivving Cleveland.
Ooh, ooh, I got an idea. There was this prison movie, and-and there was this guy who wanted to win over the other prisoners, and you know what he did?
So political. Best advice I ever got: whatever business you think you work in, you really work in sales.
We thought it might be fun to kick things off with a game of Heads Up!
You just hold this up to your head, and then we're gonna give you clues to help you guess it.
My gang said I wasn't really loco unless I shivved someone, and you're the one guy without gang protection, so...
As a Not Cop, I have to shiv a guy in the Latin gang and then blame it on Cleve...
Fighting in here amongst ourselves while Brooks is out there waiting for all of us, bagging groceries, adapting to this new world seamlessly...
Hi, I'm the warden and definitely not a psychotic prisoner who just stabbed the warden and stole his clothes.
By the rules of prison and The Love Boat, you've made up, which means you get to leave wiser and happier.
Well, we're certainly glad to have you home, Peter, but I hope you learned your lesson.
Yes, the movie was originally released in summer, but it took place on Christmas Eve, which makes it a Christmas film.
Meg, there's a lot I have to get done here, so I need you to take Stewie to the mall to meet Santa.
Oh, look, there's all the Jewish kids sitting on the rabbi's lap, where he asks them for something.
He's kind and warm. He loves unconditionally, and... and he makes... everyone feel so... so...
And it got a little faster, then faster, and the more he bounced, the bigger Meg's eyes got.
I can't tell you explicitly, since we're owned by Disney, but let me just say that
Dad? I'm gonna ask you one question, and how you answer it will determine the rest of my life.
Is there really a weight limit for the escalator, or did I just meet some mean kids?
Meg, when this is over, I'm putting rocks in my pockets and walking into the mall fountain.
One reason I work as a seasonal elf is I'm not great at time estimates.
Lady, by the power vested in me by Paul Blart, you are now banned from this mall and every mall in this county.
So, you want to tell me why you were assaulting Santa in front of the whole mall?
This could just as easily have happened while she was riding a horse or something.
Oh, don't worry, Meg. I brought this handkerchief to dab my forehead whenever you say something sexual.
I-I may need to widen my eyes until they look like a young girl's Snapchat filter.
All right, team, remember everything you learned in practice this week and forget everything after practice this week.
You know, the same feeling you got when you were five and I gave you that Malibu Barbie?
It's okay, Meg. You see, I know what each and every person needs for Christmas.
All right, I'm gonna put my leg up on this back tire and take a she-wee.
I'm totally real, so don't tell anyone about this and don't say anything to anyone.
Yeah, it's tough being a teenager, dealing with all these new emotions and feelings and streaming platforms.
Uh, I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller,
Sorry. I was just testing these... candles for a... lie I can't... think of right now.
Turns out, if you're gonna learn how to stop time in wizard school, don't leave class early to be the first in line for lunch.
And you'd think it's got to be pretty good pizza, being made by a magic wand and whatnot.
I'm your new music teacher, Mrs. Griffin, and I started from the bottom. Now I'm here.
Headstrong, full of anger, and a body that looked like it stepped right out of Redbook magazine.
I didn't leave my family to have sex with a 12-year-old boy named Vili Fualaau, get arrested for rape, give birth to his child in prison, get out, get arrested again for humping him in a car when he was 13, have his second kid in jail, get out, get married to him, change my name to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau, live my life as a disgraced sex offender, and then get dumped by him.
But I did have a little trouble in Meg's class because of that brat Connie D'Amico.
I thought I could handle their nonsense, but I just kind of froze today with Connie.
If Connie gets out of line again, don't be afraid to show her who's boss.
Um, so, not a huge deal, but if you guys could keep your chittering down,
I followed you into your cutaway because I didn't believe you showed anyone who's boss.
I know some of you kids think this class has nothing to do with your day-to-day lives, but you couldn't be more wrong.
And then I will suddenly talk much louder and faster as you're heading out the door.
Connie, I've asked Mrs. Griffin to be here since it was her class you disrupted.
Yeah, maybe because I'm awesome, and you're a gay homosexual, and also the word Jet Ski a lot?
Hey, Lois, I just got an invite for a Facebook group you started called Keep Harriet Tubman Off the 20-Dollar Bill.
Wow. Your profile pic is now just the word veterans with a circle and a line through it.
I'll keep this on the D.I. Hughley, but your next date should be with Christ.
Well, if she's really ruining your life, go down to the station and talk to Joe.
Yeah, I thought of that, but I hate competing with the sound of ringing phones and typewriter keys.
At least I'll have a paper towel with the power to take on any spill.
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, transitioning into my sad voice for the death of a white girl.
Local white girl Connie D'Amico died at the scene of an automobile accident earlier tonight, the brake lines of Connie's Celica apparently cut.
Can you imagine being the shovel that gets to scrape that ass off the road?
That's right. And the best way to crack any high-profile crime case is to do a podcast before you have all the facts.
Well, if you get a Casper mattress now, you have a hundred days to decide if it's the right mattress for you.
Can we talk about the case? I have 30 seconds before they haul me off to the freaking cafeteria.
Ziprecruiter: We vastly overestimate how many podcast listeners are in a position to hire someone.
Okay, Brian, let's go through Lois's drawers and look for clues. If you find any, let me know.
Doesn't matter. Everybody knows the way you solve a murder is to ask a barkeep if he knows anything.
When he says no, you turn around, and then he says wait and gives you an important clue.
Turns out she put a pig in a blonde wig behind the wheel of her car.
It-it was... it was nice being held up against a wall, but when you made me suck the hairdryer, I-I...
I enjoyed it, I did, but I-I don't want to do that specific thing again.
The urine-soaked hairs on the end of your penis are very off-putting to the other customers.
We do, and I can bring Planters peanuts that were opened a dozen years ago.
We're here with local hero Brian Griffin, who recently foiled a robbery at Goldman's Pharmacy, which by the way, is getting its ass kicked by the CVS across the street.
Well, let me say that even though I am a hero, you don't have to call me one.
And to show our appreciation, you get the first meal at Quahog's newest Sizzler location!
Coming up, I get all anxious and weird when the new good-looking intern brings me my coffee.
I know it's been a while, but I saw you on TV and I'm just hoping we could get together.
He sounds like a ski instructor with a full beard who plays average guitar and never texts me back.
He's a dog I used to run with back when I was living on the street.
I'm a tech entrepreneur, I've written 11 best-selling books, and I was the NBC executive who suggested we assault the nation with Chicago-themed programming.
One minute, I got a hot ginger wife, and the next I'm married to Ron Weasley.
But I would imagine it looks like an old, faded sweater that needs to be de-pilled.
Well, since Lois did something to her appearance that you don't like, you should do something to your appearance that she doesn't like.
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna add this free Fandango golf visor I got when I snuck in to see I Feel Pretty.
You know, I wish I could spend more time with you today, but I'm late for a video conference with
I've always believed I was destined for a life like yours, but something was holding me back, and now I realize it was two things.
I'll finally be able to beat that guy who fights dirty in my karate class.
Look, Stewie, this is a huge step for me, and if you can't support me, well, then maybe I should cut you out of my life, too.
I thought it might be fun to come by and sell some of my homemade jewelry to your coworkers during lunch.
Once a guy's wife sells something in the break room, no one ever looks at him the same.
Two years ago, Bentley's wife made him hang a sign-up sheet to sponsor her in an AIDS walk, and we've hated him ever since.
Well, Peter, all you have to do is say you like my haircut, and I'll leave.
I took a jewelry-making class last month with a group of preschool moms, and now I'm gonna do it as a career.
I'm doing it because of the mean seventh graders who have been chucking footballs at me all day.
I'm gonna make one political donation with your e-mail address so you'll be screwed for life.
I'm gonna start a podcast that has no focus and it'll take up an inordinate amount of time.
Gross. I'm gonna wear a denim shirt with the Looney Tunes guys embroidered on it to church every Sunday.
Then the minute Peter Griffin came along, you just got in his car and left me.
I was gonna come back and get you, and-and then, and then Trump happened and-and all that...
I've wanted to cut your balls off for years, but the fact that you're choosing to do it yourself is so much more satisfying.
I read his book. There is no greater motivation than the destruction of an enemy, and my enemy is Brian Griffin. One day, I will convince him to cut off his own balls, and that will be my greatest accomplishment.
I'm finally all caught up on New Girl, if you guys want to talk about that.
This is where I get all my credit card bills sent to and any other mail Donna would be mad about.
Anyway, they even want me to do one of Tina Fey's look how quirky and busy I am credit card commercials.
Sorry, Peter. New rule: I... I have to report any adults bragging about having a credit card.
You know what bothers me even more than all the money you put on that credit card?
Monday night you said you were working late, but there's a $62 charge at The Clam.
You said you had to work last weekend, then you bought a T-shirt that says Working weekends... Does not compute with Johnny 5 on it.
Yeah, but she's acting like everything's fine on Facebook so she can post pictures of food.
Excuse me. My table is celebrating the birthday of deceased Hawaiian pop singer Israel Kamakawiwo'ole.
Peter, you're not gonna believe whose car just broke down on Spooner Street. Tom Brady!
Boy, my butt sure was like a match that needed to be extinguished that day.
I don't care what color your belt is, you're a child and I am stronger than you.
I'm sorry we stuffed you in that Hefty Cinch Sak and pushed you in the pond.
I guess the only chance we have is if Brian sells me out to Lois.
The fat man dug a tunnel to go hang out with Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire?
Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker, here with a story that's anchor out of the studio important.
Rescue attempts are underway to free four men who have been trapped in an underground tunnel.
So if we're all gonna die anyway, what's the worst thing you guys have ever done?
I said Kid 'n Play on the phone, but they didn't understand me, so I got Coldplay.
So, uh, full disclosure, the last time I did this, the guy got torn in half.
Yeah, you know what, Tom, I think we're all gonna go home and charge our laptops a little longer tonight.
You just never know when you're gonna run out of juice and have to use your phone.
What if I told you you could accumulate all the wealth you'd ever want simply by learning the secrets of real estate?
And then what if you could use that wealth to turn yourself into a Broadway star?
So, if you've only watched TV up until April of 2020, my name would be unfamiliar to you.
I'm not the person who yells at waiters, but maybe everyone bussing tables can freeze?
Anybody with a (BLEEP) bowtie on, stop what you're doing, walk into the coatroom, and don't come out until I'm done talking!
I snuck it in your food because I wanted you to live long enough to see that global warming is bull crap.
Why did you even want me to live this long if you were just gonna leave me?
And what does the greeting at the top of the card say? Merry Christmas and a Shocking New Year.
You know, he once asked me in the event that he was sick to clear his Google history. Peter Griffin search history. Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh jacket, Winnie the Pooh vintage jacket, Winnie the Pooh letterman jacket, Winnie the Pooh windbreaker, Eeyore jacket, Eeyore vintage jacket, Eeyore letterman jacket, lactating pregnant Latinas...
Yeah, he is sick. You know, while we're here, let's take a look at your search history.
Yeah, I kind of wasted my life, except I obsessed over teaching my penis how to talk.
Oh, I want to fly standby to Pittsburgh, but I also want to host The Muppet Show.
You know what? Cut over to Brady on Brady and then take the Brady Bridge.
Yeah, I'm basically exactly the same, except I pretty much only talk about ice cream now.
Oh, I can't complain. Little hard of hearing, which is why I turned on the closed captioning.
Your father's had severe diabetes ever since they opened three ice cream stores in town.
All right, now that that's settled, let's celebrate with some of the music of now with closed captioning.
Now, let's go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, so we can be shocked at how well her people age. Tricia?
Tom, I'm standing here with flawless skin next to the shedding, crumbling, dusty ancient relics of white people my age.
Aw, and thanks for these virtual reality glasses, so I can watch porn while talking to the family.
No, this is actually just the ones who did our show right before they died. Crazy, right?
I must get my affairs in order and transfer my money to all of you.
I feel like we're in The Sting, that movie from 100 years ago about 150 years ago.
They probably did that crying turning into laughing thing when I left, what a bunch of hacks.
They're too stupid to notice I snuck into the kitchen and turned up the gas before I left.
What the hell is wrong with you? You've been staring at that old man Halloween costume for 30 minutes. but it's a big decision.
You know, I've always been afraid of being old, but now I think I'll like it just fine.
Turns out this costume is about 80% balls, and most of it's dragging behind me.
It's where you bring all your trash and you leave it for someone else to deal with.
There's free food, a bar, and you can drop a plastic spider on a string
All right, Griffin, that cutaway convinced me that you are, in fact, sure of this.
Ducks on the pond. Some of 'em brown, some of 'em prettier... All of 'em ducks.
We just need a bleep, a bloop, a walk, a balk, another balk, and, of course, a little bingo.
I can't believe the Quahog Whooping Scalpers are actually going to the playoffs this year.
That child's beach toy full of gray baseball stadium shellfish isn't sitting right for some reason.
Okay, not a fix for now but definitely something I immediately want to keep doing.
Our top story tonight, local baseball coach Peter Griffin took a knee during the national anthem today, joining the fight for equalit.
Doesn't matter if it's me or, say, you who gets applauded for his progressive thinking, as long as the message is out there.
Hey, did you ever notice he has the names Doc and Marty in his name?
A-Are you sure you're not just exploiting a real social issue so that people can call you a hero?
We now return to Seinfeld, which keeps getting edited down more and more for syndication.
Yeah, so many liberals patted me on the back today that I lost my glasses.
I need to yell at people who are just trying to buy milk on their way home from work.
You knelt at one game. It's not like opportunity's gonna come knocking on the door, offering you money for it.
Mr. Griffin, we heard about your protest and we no-heartedly believe that, with your help, we can conflate buying our products with genuine activism.
And now we want to give you a lot of money to star in a commercial for us.
Don't just have a second family, have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle.
Don't spend any time with the first two families, make a commitment to family number three, and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party.
'cause, remember, you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for.
Don't just go to jail, go to death row by killing the two other families.
Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing, send a message that you're not afraid of hell.
Two strikes, two outs, bottom of the ninth, down by one, bases loaded, Pewterschmidt up.
Well, this is WaQuahog, a secret part of Quahog with technology more advanced than any nation.
Wow! So this is, like, a secret kingdom cut off from the rest of the world?
By taking a knee, you showed the world that you see the terrible injustices our people face.
So, the Cowboys come in to today's game winners of four of their last five.
Well, Joe, you and I were talking over chopped liver and coffee this morning, and we said it has to start with the run game.
I remember after that we Lady-and-the-Tramp'd a croissant together and said this O-line needs to get healthy.
That's right, Joe. And I hope the viewers out there can see by the fact that our lips are almost touching that we are truly excited about today's matchup.
Hey, what do you say we take a pit stop in the... little boys' room.
If I could take it back, I would still kneel, but for the right reasons now.
It's not a solemn occasion, like a military funeral or, or sex between Salma Hayek and Ed Norton.
Well, I'm glad all that controversy is over and we got our old Peter back.
Hey, uh, Jerome, can you give us a minute to discuss this as a group?
Are you doing the keto diet so you lose a bunch of weight and it makes you look like you got a mascot head?
If we can't drink, we might as well lock ourselves in a room with no windows.
You will all be locked in identical rooms where you will solve a series of puzzles using clues hidden around the room.
Yes, this current talk is being videotaped and will be used as my legal release of responsibility if aforementioned toe-eating rats were to nibble, bite or maul any of the present participants' toes.
Uh, A client needs your help. His name is in the address book in your desk, but you can't find the key. Try looking in the last place you left them.
Fibonacci is also a reference to a sequence of numbers where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Fibonacci is the name of a number man from The Da Vinci Code, which was written by Tom Hanks, so the number is...
I can't control the DNA I was given, but now I can control the DNA I want to keep.
Brian, if I was such a basic bitch, would I be wearing solid black umpire's shoes?
Hi again. That man over there reading a book by himself has offered to pay for your meal if you move to a table outside.
You see, when young kids act out, what they're really doing is asking to be heard.
They have very little control in their lives, so the key, and I mean key... is to make them an active participant in these decisions.
Now the bride and groom would like to share a moment of silence to honor the family members who have passed.
They may not be with us in person, but they are with us in spirit.
Here. Restore original DNA profile. Yes. Would you like to add a Hemsworth haircut? No. Are you sure? Yes. Really? Yes. Would you like to first see a photo of what you're turning down? No. Too bad.
I know that there's got to be a part of you inside there that can understand me, and maybe Rupert can help you remember.
Remember Rupert? He's your best friend with whom you seem to have a very sexual past.
His preschool teacher said he took home the Flat Stanley this weekend, and she needs it back.
I wish I could go back to before this whole thing happened and tell him he's right.
I know, but I may not have been telling you the truth about Chris being a smart baby.
So you're saying that somehow, all my smooshed-together, crappy Griffin DNA is actually what makes me smart?
For everything to revert back to normal, you have to drown your past self in the toilet.
And don't worry, it won't be that creepy one where the Chinese mother eats her baby.
Ah. Nothing like drive time radio to remind me that I don't make enough to afford satellite radio.
Hey-hey! You're listening to WQHG 97.1, and we are Devin and Lawrence, formerly known as Weenie and The Butt.
Those nicknames no longer fly ever since several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against each of us.
And don't forget, Quahog is expected to experience record-high temperatures this week, according to our respected meteorologist
Ooh, he's not looking at much of anything right now. And those mirrored sunglasses, not doing him any favors.
I'm going to watch the older boys play Fortnite, because I'm not old enough to play Fortnite myself.
Well, it said it was designed for writers, but when I sat down to work, it just wasn't flowing through me.
Well, we can probably throw out this sunflower butter now that Stewie's classmate with the peanut allergy died.
Now that I sweat all the time, it's just natural that I be a very sweaty bomb defuser.
I've been asked to be an overly sweaty Southern lawyer during a landmark civil rights case.
Snack Cart Steve, elderly widows with paper fans, woman in the third row with a flower hat,
Yay Radley, Herman Munster judge, lazy dog who wandered in due to the heat, crazed Al Pacino, old Robert Duvall, young Robert Duvall, in-between Robert Duvall, the books of John Grisham.
Sorry, guys. All I have left are one pair of extra-large contact lenses and one pair of extra-small.
Come on, we got to think of some way to raise that money in a hurry.
The shameless film star who made a movie college kids used to like is again asking people who have less to give him more.
We'll raise the money we need, pay back the store, and then e-mail the backers, saying we ran into trouble and couldn't finish the project.
Great idea, Brian. Much better than that version of Free Solo narrated by a concerned Midwestern mom.
You see, Mom, we try to stay focused on the task at hand here at Griffin, Griffin, Griffin, Griffin and Griffin.
Hey, Lois. I'm at the small bodega in the living room lobby trying to pick out a new baby card for Janine.
Yeah, right? Anyway, should I get one with a baby with SpaghettiOs on his head, like, This is what it's gonna be like, or one with a stork with an injured back?
Again, I want to say I'm so glad all of our schedules lined up so we can work together. And, as a reminder, we've got New York on the line.
My father made holes in belts, and my mother was the Italian guy on a pizza box.
Don't make me beat you with the instrument with which I make holes in belts!
Anyway, all that is why I want to make a movie about a dog who joins a hockey team.
Now, the way this works is we simply gather information and I make up my mind an hour ago.
I'm sitting there at my desk, trying to watch porn on sites you guys haven't figured out yet, and she comes in and kisses me.
Now, Barbara, the reason you are here at Super HR is there's been an accusation of unwanted touching and an overly sexualized work environment.
All right. Dishes washed, kids off to school, taking my boobs out of my bra.
I just stepped off a bird from Omaha, and I have a very tight window.
Well, I'm gonna have to circle back with Ken to get it past the goal line.
Not to put too fine a point on it, but when push comes to shove, look, listen, look.
I got to go crowd the gate so people think I'm in first class, even though I'm in boarding group seven.
Peter, for God's sake, can I not just have 15 minutes of peace and quiet in my own kitchen?
Attention, please, we are gonna begin pre-boarding Flight 238 to Scottsdale, beginning with our first-class and Prestige members.
Scuse me, is there any way I can get on the plane now, even though I'm in the seat whose back touches the bathroom?
Chris will be on speakerphone from down the hall, and, as a reminder, that may result in a five-second delay.
I would like to officially thank Stewie for spearheading this project, and I'd like to thank Chris for his help scouting all the locations.
Yeah, speaking of scouting, you sure got good at scouting the location of the nearest Burger King.
Chris, we're having a little delay issue here, so try and come in a little sooner, yeah?
You're going to slap the table halfway through your line, and, Chris, when you hear the slap on your end, that's when you talk.
Okay. Uncle Cornelius stands in the doorway in stunned silence not knowing what to say but knowing he should say something.
Uncle Cornelius slaps the table in anger as he walks across to pour himself a gin and...
We can put your logo on anything: a mug, a set of pens, a mug.
Lois, you know once I hear that, I can't get it out of my head.
Well, we could bring that down to $29.99, but you'd have to buy 4,000 of them.
Everyone out in the hot sun for an hour, with no information as to when we're coming back!
I guess you're right. When you look at it, most marriages are just a couple hours a night.
And we even had $300,000 left over to buy snacks. M-Movie snacks are very expensive is, is-is the joke.
I only read four books in my life, and three of them were about Johnny Bench.
Damn it! I shopped at Trader Joe's for this fancy cocktail party, and once again, your ignorance of books has ruined it.
I got a junior high book list here, and starting tomorrow, you are reading one of these books.
You better, 'cause this was more embarrassing than when we played truth or dare with present-day Madonna.
I am ready for you to be lame and a book and not something unexpected.
We've got a red station wagon blasting Panama and being awesome and partying and being rad.
Negative, Dispatch. Just need to wait for that Runnin' a little bit hot tonight part.
He's gonna time his jump for the greatest harmonized sound drop in '80s rock history.
I didn't want to play this card, Peter, but if you won't listen to me, listen to the pancake with slices of banana on it.
Hey, in case you need it, someone left this business card at the crash site.
I mean, he's not responding to my advances, so it's either a coma, or he's a frigid bitch.
Mrs. Griffin, I have some good news or some bad news depending on how you feel about your husband.
I can't get anything less than a ten, so if there's a problem, you should tell me about it right now.
Running into a tunnel that's not really a tunnel but just something the Road Runner painted on the side of a rock.
Honestly, I-I'm amazed you haven't died in some kind of Black Mirror techno nightmare by now.
I want you to line up and give him one compliment about his Netflix show, the Santa Clarita Diet.
The comments have to exclusively relate to the Santa Clarita Diet, a show which aired three full seasons on Netflix.
It's over. You'll never forgive us for killing you at the hospital, so we're done.
And I definitely won't have any flashbacks of our happy times together to convince me otherwise.
I-I thought maybe your father would show up at the last second and we'd have one of those airport scenes.
Well, that's a nice movie trope, Lois, but the post-9/11 reality is there's no way a nonticketed civilian can...
I will as soon as I find out if he has a banned-from-the-Apple-Store podcast I can listen to.
Coming up, I find even more sand on my body from a beach toilet I used a week ago.
But first, tragedy strikes close to home, as a car crash near my apartment claims the life of a local teen girl.
What brings you around at this late hour with your uniform on and your hat held mournfully against your chest?
Peter, Lois, it pains me above the waist to tell you that Meg is dead.
She got in a car wreck, and was burned beyond recognition, and I leveled up on Fortnite this weekend, but you probably only care about the first two things.
Your little angel was one stamp away from a free sub, which only adds to this horrific tragedy.
Usually one of the guys would swipe a thing like this, use it on the way home, but I snagged it for ya.
When I was hastily relocated to this parish a week ago, the last thing I thought I'd have to do is stand before you on such a sad occasion.
A family losing a child is like a Trivial Pursuit wheel losing a pie piece.
And you have to keep reminding everyone playing the game, Don't forget. I already got 'Entertainment'. What a pain.
I hope that you're with Bubba, and I want you to know that Lieutenant Dan is walking around...
She'd wrap up both hands like oven mitts and act like she was cleaning out a pot of burnt chili.
Maybe we should just have a moment of silence as we hear the guy down the street scream at his barking dog.
I just thought I'd come by and see if I could borrow a cup of tampons.
You know, Stewie, when Meg was little, we used to love to make Christmas cookies together.
In the case of Kent and Bradley v. Holiday Dongs, the court rules that you must give us the recipe.
And because of that, he did not get into heaven, just like they've always been saying.
Chris, here are the keys to the drivers ed car to use anytime you want.
So was that before or after you were one of the first black women to do math for NASA?
And two, to find the owner of this X-Men water bottle someone left in wood shop... Does anyone recognize it?
I'm not gonna tell you which character's on it, you have to be able to tell me the character.
But now, here to help you mourn, an artist who specializes in sensitive music to do finger stuff to,
I think we can all agree that John is entitled to take whichever student he wishes home with him tonight.
And finally, the Quiznos across the street has graciously taken out a full page ad in the yearbook that will feature a dedication page to Meg.
And I think if Meg were here today, she'd be the first one to agree.
You faked your death, I fake orgasms and being impressed by my husband's accomplishments at work.
Experts say Hurricane Michael Caine is 100 times more impressive than Hurricane Dean Cain, which just seems silly now.
Let's all just go to the bathroom and pretend we can't hear each other go.
And there's a book in here that makes you tired just by looking at it.
A book called T, written by Holly Bibble. Uh, Peter, I think that's the Holy Bible...
Seriously, could somebody else read this? In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth, and the sitcom joke that goes, 'That went well.' And the first man and woman, Adam and Eve.
You know, I-I gave them water, the sun, a clear road map to hating gays.
My girlfriend got a piece in an art show, and I'd look like a dick if I didn't go.
I'll be nibbling terrible cheese cubes with Santa Fe people who couldn't cut it in the real world.
I have nothing to gain from lying to you, aside from the minor sexual thrill of watching someone eat something.
Well, the girls with either their brothers or their fathers, and the boys with either their sisters or their mothers.
Are we just gonna let that guy in the parking lot keep screaming at his girlfriend?
And again, you'll let me know if another older, heavyset woman wanders by in nothing but a T-shirt?
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. Noah was feeding his children chocolate cake for breakfast.
Michelob Ultra! To build the ark, Noah stole the wood from the front of his neighbor's house.
No, no, no, no, Noah! And the animals came, two by two, and were given poorly assigned rooms.
Oh, good for you! Soon, the Great Flood came and the ark set sail. Then, like every father on a boat,
Look, why don't I tie the knots, you polish the teak. Can you do that?
Now let's divide it into banks and strips as one normally does with land. Shem and Ham married their mom, while she and Noah remained the best of friends. Noah even danced with Ham at his second marriage to his daughter. Shem and Ham had twins named Phlegm and Yam, who married each other and gave birth to Noah's next daughter-wife.
Now God only brings natural disasters to places that have too much butt stuff going on.
How about this laminated motel information sheet? Checkout is noon. Must dial nine to reach outside prostitute. In the event of fire, follow the older heavyset lady in just a T-shirt. There are no dining facilities on-site, but guests are encouraged to visit the Applebee's, which is a short walk across the six-lane highway.
I had an umbrella, but as this is a comedy, you can imagine what happened to it.
You know, that actually reminds me of another Bible story: The Last Supper. It was the week before Easter, and Jesus and Mary Magdalene were dyeing eggs with that cheap messy coloring kit from the drugstore that has those weird paper things that are like costumes for the eggs but never really fit around the eggs...
Somebody'd have to nail me to a piece of wood and throw me in a cave grave.
Like last time, Paul was on his speaker phone, and we were like, Paul, you're up, and he'd be like, I'm what?
Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm not taking advice about germs from a whore.
If it isn't spaghetti, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Now get out of here!
Listen, pal, I forgive you, because you know not what you do, but get the hell out of here.
Oh, you think so? It was a chicken fight of biblical proportions. And then, there was Easter. Also, pregnant ladies have to have the baby.
We got to spend time as a family, and read a few stories from the Bible.
Maybe there's one more story we can all learn an important lesson from... oh, oh, it's a whole big toenail.
Yeah, now we got three months of sour-smelling house to look forward to while it dries out.
Yeah. I think I'm gonna get a job as a night security guard and just read it constantly.
I'm already putting lots of notes in the margins. And the king said unto her, 'What aileth thee?' And she answered, 'This woman said unto me, give thy son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
Look, man, I was just seeing if anyone dropped off my umbrella at the lost and found.
You're going to be like one of those DJs on SiriusXM, where it's all national so nothing's local anymore.
I'm going to be massaging your shoulders, just so I can say in court that I do it to everyone.
And if you want to liven things up, you can start out by saying, Good morning, Vietnam!
Okay, well, the student council meeting will be held today at 3:00 in the gymnasium.
Brian, I'd love to stay and talk, but Bugs Bunny is about to make this tenor hold a note for far longer than anyone should.
As a courtesy to the hardworking cast and crew, we ask you to please refrain from looking at your iPad
So we're all decided, our last high school play was about as gay as we wanna go.
Sure, more than once I've caught him eating Crisco with a spoon, but I can't watch everything he eats.
And deep down, he's just like everyone else... all together in one big pair of pants.
If your son had been shot, all I could offer is thoughts and prayers, but this calls for a far stronger response.
Uh, excuse me. I saw a commercial in which a dog had a very shiny coat.
That's right. And it's just Firstname Shepherd now that you've had me fired and I have no income.
And now I'm living in my car, just panhandling outside Miles Teller movies, which is pretty slim pickings, obviously.
Lois, can I talk to you one step over this way, yet magically out of earshot from him?
All right, Peter, he can live with us until he gets back on his feet.
Also, would it make any sense to put all the beds in one room and make one room a trampoline room?
Who but a witch would not give up her virtue to a man who brought her a luncheon of salt pork and boiled sweets?
And my aunt. She fell out of the casket at her funeral and her dress came up.
Did you know they pack cotton in corpses' noses, rectums and vaginas to prevent embalming fluid from leaking?
Je was watching Je Love Lucy, then je... was wondering why Lucy wasn't talking so much, and then je realized it was just a orange cat in a ashtray.
Just join me one step over here, yet out of earshot, so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.
We-we... uh, okay, we're gonna deal with that thing and then we're gonna deal with detention.
Thank you, Your Honor. In my case to prove that Brian Griffin is, in fact, an idiot, and therefore cannot be defamed, I call Brian Griffin to the stand.
If that is true, please tell me the difference between Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg.
Now, Mr. Griffin, I'm going to recite a biography and I'd like you to maintain your composure. On December 1, 1951,
At this point, I will turn things over to Brian's lawyer, the gentleman from Table, Knee, Bump and Associates.
This Sunday, on an all-new Family Guy, the Griffins are grounded and the one actor of color plays a character named Lawnmower Guy.
The game begins. Hey, cutie. Long time, no talk. I'm trapped in Europe and all I have is my bikini.
I'm gonna walk out that door, come back in and you'll just be excited to see me.
And again, we cannot show you the nude photos the Spanish teacher sent to that kid.
My name is Peter Griffin, and I get to the in conclusion part of my speech faster than most people.
Sorry, Lois, I needed you out of the way so I could kiss this lady.
Read it to me while I eat my soup. Ferb was having a throbby morning.
If you are not rooting for Lahore, please you may leave, I can tell you!
Guys, from now on, I am living my life according to the Magic 8 Ball.
Ahoy! Are you looking to build a city where sports fans can be notoriously racist?
And can our own 9/11 be, like, one one-thousandth as bad, but we'll still make a fricking movie about it?
Okay, I don't know if this is gonna be a problem, but we forgot to bring the letter R.
Mr. Griffin, if a Magic 8 Ball asked you to jump off a building, would you do that, too?
I remind you that... in honor of Lent... today's coffee service will not include Chewy Chips Ahoy.
I can't believe Stewie finally said his first word and it ends up being... that.
I was feeling so much intense emotion in the moment, and that one word somehow just burst through.
I brought my own veggie burgers, but I'm not gonna make a big deal about it.
You're saying that because of a swear word, my son isn't good enough for your pool party?
Oh, I'm trying to prove that Peter's the one cussing in the house, so I waxed the staircase for him to fall down.
In fact, I'm meeting him at the park to eat unsalted saltines on the swings.
Lois couldn't find the swearer, nor could she remove the voice of the grating Caillou narrator from her head.
Lois was sad, but not as sad as she was going to be when she realizes she has to use those ouchie wipes to make a potty next to the store dumpster.
Plus, if I go, that means I won't be here to help out around the house or feed you guys or monitor your Internet usage every day...
Uh, I don't know what that was, but, Lois, you should go to that resort.
Lois Griffin? My name is Roger, and I'll be guiding this relaxation adventure for you and the other white women, plus an Asian woman who has a white husband back home.
If you hear a sound, just, um, rec-knowledge it and then, like, let it go?
So I'll just put you in this baby seat you've grown out of, right where the rocks are gonna fly.
I mean, I'm just saying... I already have a word that does all those things when I say it.
Everyone's glad you're home, except for mean older brother Buzz, who never says anything nice.
You thought you were a big wheel till you found out squares don't roll, man.
Rupert, remember that very expensive bottle of coconut water I got from Pressed Juicery in Newport that we were saving for a special occasion?
I just took it one day at a time and minded my own beeswax, and now look.
I know I wasn't originally supportive when you joined A.A., but I have to say,
Nobody's ever gotten Busy Bee three weeks in a row before, and with you by my side, I know I can do it.
Ugh, can't you ever come back from shopping without looking like you were getting supplies for a refugee camp?
We've been firing on all cylinders lately, and I just wanted to let him know I care.
He's, like, three years old, and he's in a mobility scooter rolling around an oxygen tank.
I've j... I've had a lot of time to think, and, well, look, I-I don't see why this has to change anything between us.
I want to get on stage and talk about my husband and how he leaves the toilet seat up, et cetera.
Must I show you my genitalia in order to book a gig at this establishment?
(regular voice): Can I just stick around a little bit so I can go up onstage when you guys win an Emmy?
Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.
You know, all of your responses have been very similar, so you might want to nip that in the bud.
I-I don't know how to respond that won't sound similar to other responses I've made, so just, uh, continue.
Right. Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact, ten minutes later, I'll get a chime notification on my phone, and I can pull up the video.
He's just here 'cause I got gum on him and he stuck to my hand.
Just a warning, I had some bad experiences at camp, so now I sleep with one eye open.
Excuse me, I'm in Bali on a spiritual journey but I seem to have mistakenly wandered on to the heavy people beach.
And I... Yeah, I finally feel like I'm getting my life together again af-after the breakup.
That black-and-white TV still has a white dot from when they turned it off six years ago.
I thought I could live with the idea of you and Rupert together, I-I really did.
I now realize the only way I can go on with my life is by ending yours.
Okay, Rupert, so remember, we sit through a nice dinner and then you go back with Stewie.
And I didn't want to say it because I-I didn't know if you were going to say it back and oh, what a fool I've... Chris!
Because of the lake water, uh, I said some things that I did not mean.
Jordan Peele is our greatest living filmmaker, and visionary, both in comedy and in drama.
Some lady up the block is giving away all of her husband's stuff 'cause he shot himself
Since Willem Dafoe has more bones in his face than most people have in their entire body, he's perfect for carving, 'cause the angles are so sharp.
Oh, hey, Lois. I'm just hollowing out this tree for the Keebler elves to live in.
Did you hear that one vet technician say our little squirrel here was in the 70th percentile for height and weight?
Well, if it's your elbow that's bothering you, we should start by checking your reflexes.
As a celebrity dick, it's always been my passion to own a ranch in a low-tax state that I list as my primary residence.
But this type of thing is usually done in strip malls next to a little caesars.
I know the holidays are still months away, but I was just so excited to take our family Christmas card photo.
I will concede that's a good song, but we don't live in Memphis, so I find it confusing.
Everyone, after the service, you are all invited to a small reception to honor our beloved squirrel.
But, first, please join me in a frozen-in-place moment of silence, followed by a manic scattering in all directions.
Yes, thanks to you. If it weren't for you, our sweet baby would still be alive.
If you hadn't kept the squirrel up so late, none of this would have happened.
What? I'm not the one who just had to post the video to Instagram that very second.
You couldn't even enjoy the moment for one damn minute before desperately groveling for online approval from aunts you never talk to and past coworkers you don't even like!
Is that so? Well, if you had a newer phone, it wouldn't have taken so long to upload the video.
And don't think I didn't smell the Charleston Chew on your breath at the service.
Maybe if you'd been a little sharper on the evening in question, we wouldn't be in this...
The female power to belittle is such that the recipient can physically shrink in stature.
I hate the one story you tell at every cocktail party about almost meeting John Kerry.
I know every word that's gonna come out of your mouth before you even say it.
Well, let me first start by saying y'all's doing your relationship a huge favor by coming to couples counseling.
Now, why don't y'all start by each trying to suck up to me so I can choose who I'm-a side with?
Stewie promised he'd make healthy meals for us, but all he ever makes is frozen pizza.
You said you loved pizza, especially when I make the ones with the crust made of hwheat.
Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story while I share looks with Stewart that say, whoa, this is what you got to deal with?
We can't bring our baby back, but we'll always have Tuesday through Friday of last week.
I's just gonna open up this big book and use the time you're paying for to figure out when you're next available.
Once you hit a certain age, that's the swimsuit you have for the next 40 years.
When I go back to school, my greaser friends are gonna say, Tell me more, tell me more, and I'm gonna say you were a slut.
Mom, I tried to look at a... lady who was lying with her... straps down and she saw me and she said something to her friend and they laughed!
You know, one of those videos where you can't tell if he's enjoying it or not.
Tanner became Head of Household, while host Julie Chen had plastic surgery to look less Chinese.
With nominations looming and Les fired for his predatory behavior, the Boys Alliance of Jeremy and Pablo strategized while Julie stepped down from The Talk to avoid uncomfortable questions, but continues to host this show and spend Les' enormous wealth.
I snarfed a bunch of oysters from over there, where the foam is super yellow.
How 'bout we do something that ain't been done under a pier in 50 years: have heterosexual sex.
Can you make 'em shorts, cut off the sleeves, and make the shirt say Billabong?
All I know is that we both set up this cutaway at the same time, and now we're inside this cutaway in Australia.
So, you and I set up a cutaway at the same time and that somehow put us in the cutaway?
And it takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.
Lois, are you saying that it takes a setup from both of us to get in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand?
Exactly, Peter. It takes a setup from both of us to get in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.
Peter, this may sound crazy, but this is our chance at the getaway we didn't have at the beach.
It's just as big as you want it to be but not so big that it's gonna distract him.
This is better than a spin class where the instructor is just two giant Swedish legs.
All right, just keep giving me details and I'll be taking notes and definitely not drawing cool TIE fighters on this notepad.
Then, out of nowhere, Peter and Lois get all angry with us and start yelling at us.
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia. R as in Robert Loggia. O as in Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia. B as in By God, that's Robert Loggia.
All right, get him in a room and give him 20 cc's of Log Cabin negative.
I chose this cutaway 'cause it's fun and for sure not to feed my fentanyl addiction.
Ooh! And next door is a classic song about AIDS that I now partly regret.
Peter, enough. I know you want to have fun with drugs, but what's the point of drugs if you don't have kids to share 'em with?
Damn it, Lois. We're having fun for once, but all you can talk about is the kids.
Okay, you don't like these jokes, but let's see what all the moms eating soup at Panera Bread think.
I haven't been given a morsel of food since you left, by the way. Not one crumb.
This is better than being at home. We make a better team than at home. Worse than at home? The AIDS person is Tom Devanney, which is the name of a Family Guy writer home?
And now, if there are any spiders the size of dinner plates that object to this marriage, please speak now or forever hold your peace.
Shut up, everyone, shut up! First things first, did you clean up the house before coming to CutawayLand?
Joe, shut up. No one cares. Just tell me, are you in the real world, or are you a cutaway?
Well, according to a 16-year-old autistic fan in Akron, Ohio, In order for the Griffins to escape from a theoretical CutawayLand, they must first journey back to the original Family Guy cutaway with Adolf Hitler and kill him.
Well, this is where it gets a little complicated. In order to return to the original cutaway, each family member must...
Yeah, I know he was evil, but do we really have the right to take the life of another human being?
Hey, Peter. If you have a sec, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Yeah, you're my best friend, and, well, I'd like you to be Susie's godfather, too.
Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather is closing the door in your wife's face while she wonders what's going on inside.
Now, before the child goes in the water, has it been at least 20 minutes since she ate?
I hereby christen this child in the name of Jesus Christ, who was killed by we-don't-know-who, it's not important.
From now on, every Sunday you get to eat a hard cookie and pretend it's a guy.
And let me assure you, any shouting you hear from the kitchen is not Gordon Ramsay tearing us apart.
Oh, God, here comes Doug. He just got a race car bed, and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.
I don't look at those. I'm too busy fixing my hair in the mirror... Oh! I'm sorry.
Uh, it's a very special day, as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ before she can consent to it or have any conception of what's happening.
Joe, thank you for having us in this restaurant with a painted wall that makes Venice look terrible.
Uh, for the kids, we've got games and also a party princess dressed as Elsa who's clearly a prostitute, but please don't proposition her here, just nod in her direction, trust me, she'll get it.
God, I can't believe Mike Pence came out of the closet just before he hung himself in prison.
And as a mafioso, I'll be doing more voice-overs, which will always begin by naming everyone at the event.
It was one of those breakfasts where you realize you put on your boxers the wrong way and you need an excuse to leave the room.
Interesting question. My value system will vary wildly between incredible immorality and intense social conservatism.
Now, kids, before you go to school, let's discuss what you tell your friends about me.
You're not safe here anymore, so I'm gonna send you where all the murderers are from.
With the guys at my side, we were the most powerful criminal organization in Quahog
Even since Dad became a mobster, he's been giving me a ton of Italian children's books.
Like, look at this, this morning, totally unprompted, they sent me a lovely wrapped fish.
I had a beautiful family and it would be a shame if anything happened to them.
I think you need to get wise to what's going on here, because their next message may not be so subtle.
God, I can't believe Melania was deported to Slovenia and then hung herself in a European prison.
