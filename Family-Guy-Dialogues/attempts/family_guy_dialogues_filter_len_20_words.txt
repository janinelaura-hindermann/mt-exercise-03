But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman!
Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Not today or tomorrow.
Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened.
When she worries, she says, I told you so and: Stop doing that. I'm asleep. So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?
The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys.
No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into.
Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old trying to make amends... ...for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds play.
But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless.
I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner?
It sure was. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: She sells seashells down by the seashore.

The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Faloppia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.
If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell.
Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time.
Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.
Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable.
Class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea.
The killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river!  Jinkies! What a mystery!
Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced.
The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment?
Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together.
If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little...
It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life it's who you do it with, and your family...
I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your father.

I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt. Dear Diary... It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated  in that amniotic Attica. As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity  I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months.
I'm up to 11. As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white!
Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount.
Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives.
Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home.
As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite!
Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change.
When life is getting to you put some fresh in your life Let Mintos freshen up your life Life is just a breeze when you stay fresh and cool Because Mintos puts the fresh in life Taste that freshness Just can't beat it Mintos freshness Let Mintos freshen your life

Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine.
All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you.
Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well.
No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty.
Meg, take Stewie upstairs. Show me the way to go home Everybody! I'm tired and I want to go to bed Just the women!
Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks. You'll never know just how much I love you You'll never know just how much I care
Yeah! And if I try, I still couldn't hide my love for you You oughta know for haven't I told you so?
All right! If there is some other way to prove that I love you I swear I don't know how
Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight. Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for You know you got the brand of kisses that I die for
Hit it! Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta If someone takes a spill it's me and not you Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade
Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? It's got steam heat I got steam heat But I need your love to keep away the cold I got...
Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers.
No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special.
Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints.
Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say I love you every day.
Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless.

Man. What'll I do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model.
What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference.
Gosh, I'd like to help. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on my ass for five minutes.
Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys, you know to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged!
All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. You think you have won You think all is well But kiss my green ass I shall see you in hell!
Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.
Yes, you forgot the words. Jesus loves me He loves me a bunch Because He always puts Skippy In my lunch
I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company.
And when the kids at school see us on TV they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, That psycho is my dad!
I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano, had you not driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a. m.
She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. l shall give her a piece of my mind!
Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. ln fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created.
Anything on that remote lower than mute? l got a surprise for you, Chris. lt'll have to wait. This is where the Fonz goes....
Dad, what would you say if l told you l didn't want to be in the Scouts? l'd say come again? And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.''
Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room. l thought that was just when you were asleep.
What do you want? l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. l just want to draw. l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke.
Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter.
Chris, l am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again.
Do not go until l wave my flag. l can't stress that enough. l'll wave it once just to show you how it looks.
Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore? l think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together.
Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. l sort of bet our car. l won't panic. l need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife.
No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you? l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish. lt just seemed like such a good cause.
But we're not allowed to return gambling losses. l think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too.
Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past. l come from a long line of you people.
So are you gonna give me back my car, or what? l have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait here.
How long do these vision quests usually take? lt varies. lt depends on the person's age, and height, and sign.
Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision? lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees. And l saw the Fonz.
A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer. l want a spiritual vision, too! Man! l guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. l mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity.

Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. ...almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits.
It sure has. You know what they say, If you don't like... ...the weather in New England, go back where you came from.
I'll get us the best help there is. Dear MacGuyver... Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking straw. Please save my dog.

Newport, Rhode Island home of New England's most elegant and historic estates the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt.
Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else.

That's why we got that Steven Hawking guy. My God, this house is freakin' sweet I used to pass lots of gas Lois ran away Now we've got 30 rooms Hello, beans, good-bye, spray We'd take a bullet just for you
Stewie! Prepare to suck that golden teat Now that you're stinking rich we'll gladly be your bitch My God, this house is freakin' sweet
Lois' friend yacht boy and his lovely wife Caca invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again.
You're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa.
Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City he saw that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader.

But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.
Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me. So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell... ...where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever.
That one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital.
I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants!
The Rhode Island Cock Society is sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why the suggestive name.
It's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket.
I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand a very devoted son.
I always wake up fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this.
Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it.
Well, in that case, Dad l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.
Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for party over here!
Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together.
Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nukular holocaust: cockroaches and Twinkees. And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.
We can dig Joe out of the driveway and we can build a community just like the one we had.
But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a year.
I dreamt I saw the strangest episode of Family Guy, and there was a giant chicken and Stewie was an octopus.
They were so itchy I couldn't sleep, which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if I was OK and I said I couldn't sleep.
I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he bends a French biscuit on the conveyor belt?
I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs.
Oh, by the way, nice rap. I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile.
Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting, glow of sensuality that surrounds you.
Lois... did your heart ever want to ask something but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be?
Sometimes we should cherish what we already have, like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share, that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world.
It's fall. The time of year when the leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.

Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots I just want to crack you with a cue stick.
Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer!
If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the time you could do it yourself, like the law says you should.
Combine one small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman.
You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan.
And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who in turn sells them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family.

Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom?
Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids.
I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long...
You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers l'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire.
You guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: Aren't you Richard Simmons?
Man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: I have no son. I have no son, and Mom just stood there.
Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed?
Yeah! I've thought about it, like in church and stuff but I don't think I could ever do what you do.
Yeah, about that I was pretty sure I was gonna die because there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious.
I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids.
I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice.
If you look out the window, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn.

Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus.
Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think.
It works! Look how tiny they are! Oh, no not in springtime summer, winter, or fall No, never would I leave you at all
Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York.
Five, six, seven, eight. Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition Met the greatest earthquake ever known High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft And plunged them down a thousand feet below to the Land of the Lost
It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it.
I'm presenting Peter Griffin presents The King and l a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story.
Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I.
Action! Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him. Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him.
On Springer yesterday, they had I won't share my husband and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts.
Someone radiant and sassy with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression.
If I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be?
I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny.
I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America. ANNA rules Because I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels ANNA won Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun Dance and shout 'He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt Though they tried to defeat me they can all just freakin' eat me Because he blew all of us away In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay
But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is well, he's gotta be creative.
Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year.
That's so cute. You're just afraid that because you're a woman, you'll do something stupid, like buy that time-share, or not realise I taped over our wedding video with soft-core porn.
Mr and Mrs... Griffin. If you sign this contract without reading it, I'll take your blank cheque, and you won't not be not loving your time-share before you know it.
We'll take the box. We'll take the box. You gave up a boat for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.
This comic sucks! He couldn't make me laugh even if I was laughing my ass off and he was making me do it. Huh?
Three. One dirty, stinking ape to screw in the light bulb, and two dirty, stinking apes to throw faeces at each other.
As a matter of fact, if you were any slower at cooking, you'd... well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all, now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
Well, maybe that was part of my act. Urine happens to be very edgy, but an unfunny person like you wouldn't understand that.
You are a valued member of our business team and every bit as important to this company as I am.
You're a valued member of our business team and I will give you a raise tomorrow if you come to work without a shirt on.
That's a bad mud puddle. I wouldn't want you to step in that and get your nice shoes all ruined.
You know I love you, but I have to admit there are times when I wish you were a little more sensitive.
OK, ladies. I'm gonna start with a Greg Louganis triple Salchow and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half...
It's your fault we have so much crime in this country and it's your fault we have so much violence in this country.

He failed a class, it's not like he felt up his cousin in the garage that Thanksgiving when I was 19.
I tried that once. It got me in a lot of trouble. If you don't put Coach back on the air, I'll be really upset. The skillful acting of Craig T. Nelson will be missed a lot. Signed, Peter Griffin.
Okay, we're gonna get our show back on the air and were not gonna be intimidated by any slick executive types.
And in gridiron news, little Johnny Gobraun a terminally ill 8-year-old who dreamed of playing quarterback for New England got his wish today thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.

I'm not going to jail, Chris doesn't have to die and best of all, Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.
From the cats who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft and Black Kramer v. Kramer, comes a funky flick so bad you gonna say, Damn, that's funky.

Great. You can get Mr. Fargas his job back. l'm sorry! But l do have a mind of my own!
And l happen to agree with the School Board's decision. l know you're a feminist and l think that's adorable but this is grown-up time and l'm the man. l'm not giving that lunatic his job back and that's final.
Lois, l can't let you deprive our children of a fine teacher like Mr. Fargas. l'm gonna stop you the only way l can by killing you in the race for School Board President!
Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap and if running against you is the only way to get him back then l am gonna run like the Six Million Dollar Man.
Don't just sit there! l have misbehaved! l've been a bawdy little monkey! lf that vile woman were here, she'd prove a worthy adversary.

Winning was only half the battle. lf you blow this chance to do something good for our kids you'll be the biggest loser!

There's quite a crowd outside. l haven't witnessed pandemonium like this since Ridiculous Day down at the deli when prices were so low they were ridiculous.
And he's right. Pin it on the old ball and chain. l can't do that. Lois is mad enough at me without.... l'm sorry. l can't look at you! l mean, l can handle ugly. But this is like circus ugly.
We now take you live to Peter Griffin Junior High where embattled School Board President Peter Griffin is fighting for his political life.
Mom, what are you doing here? l thought you were mad at Dad. l am. l just came to see him twist in the wind.
Oh, honey. Maybe. A parent giving porno to their kid is a terribIe thing... ...but I'm here to teII you that I'm innocent!
Oh. Oh, God, sorry. Can you give me the line again? Not the whole line, just the end of it.
I don't get it. I poured it in her drink. ...name was Steve Rock. First black I ever did it with.
Don't feel bad, Chris. I didn't even want it. Now we all get a free trip to New York cos Mr Monatti thinks you could be a famous artist.
Lois, our son has been blessed with a great gift, and I'm gonna do everything I can to nurture that talent and help him succeed.
Then I'll use him to live out all my frustrated hopes and dreams, because that's good parenting, right, Bing Crosby?
Right, Peter. And if your kids give you any lip, you can beat 'em with a sack of sweet Valencia oranges.
My son's gonna be the best thing to happen to New York since Mayor Giuliani had all the homeless secretly killed.
Ah, that's OK, kids. So I don't have my name on an amusement park, and maybe I'll never be famous.
All right, we're gonna use a fan brush here. I want you to take some hunter green, and we're gonna put a happy little bush down here in the corner.
It was 360 years ago that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket set sail for the new colony of Rhode Island.
But, as legend has it,  he was saved by a magic clam, who brought him to shore and shared the vision of a new colony, which would be called Quahog.
Miles never spoke again. But every year until his death - from a combination of tuberculosis and a tomahawk to the head - he went to the shore on this day in hopes that the magic clam would return.
I look at you and I see a series. We would like to put cameras in your house and follow the drama that is your family. Kinda like The Real World.
It's just there's always been a lot of tension between Lois and me, and it's not so much that I want to kill her, it's just I want her not to be alive any more.
I sometimes wonder if all women are this difficult, and then I think to myself My God! Wouldn't it be marvellous if I turned out to be a homosexual?
I have an announcement. Meg Griffin's plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan. It spun in. There were no survivors.
We could offer you the guest room, provided that it doesn't bother you that my Great Uncle Chet died in there.
You know, some people think that dandelions are weeds, but, uh, you know, I always think... who the hell decided tulips were so great?
Uh, I don't know if Mom and Dad told you, but we usually have breakfast naked and I'm allowed to videotape it.
I didn't make cheerleader because I'm so plain, and I still don't have a date for Friday night, as usual.
It's not fair. If I don't get any airtime, how am I ever gonna get my own spin-off where I'm a retired baseball umpire who opens a bar?
Me too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother who isn't as good-Iooking or successful and never answers my letters, but he's still a Baldwin, dammit, and so is Meg.
Dad, if bad men broke into the house, and they had guns, and they put a gun up to your head and made you choose who you wanted to live, me or Meg, who would you choose?
Oh, come on, Lois. This is gonna be worse than when we had to watch your Uncle's Jerry's snuff film.
I'd like to start by asking the women to leave the room, because this part of the tape is for men only. We'll see you in a little while.
If Montgomery Clift, who was in From Here to Eternity with Burt Lancaster, who was in Atlantic City with Susan Sarandon, who was in White Palace with Kevin Bacon. There.
And God said Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better? Jerry, pull the high end out. I'm still getting some hiss back.
I thought if I held Connie's toad, she'd make one of the cool guys ask me to the Snow Ball.
We all did it. If you want to be a Supreme Court justice, you gotta pick up that cherry with your butt cheeks and drop it in that beer.
Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take to get to the centre of a Rhode Island state prison?
Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to us as parents to be a part of the solution.
I've gone undercover to get rid of the toad problem, so your school can be safe and innocent like the good old days.
God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and this is all just a side effect from the chemo.
This is great. Not only did I live long enough to see Meg go to her first dance, but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.
I farted real loud on purpose to make the guys laugh, and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie Johnson ralphed up her Salisbury steak.
Mother, this could almost have passed for a palatable banana pudding, but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one of your wretched culinary abortions!
Hey, Connie pulled a power move. When the most popular girl in school asks you to the dance, you don't say no, you say Haba-haba-haba... OK.
Me? I did a lot of drugs, married some broad named Cher... and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.
And Lando Griffin,  a popular student at a local high school, was killed last night when his motorcycle careened off Dead Man's Curve.
Police were baffled when no body was found,  but they decided not to ask questions and just let everyone get on with their lives.
I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get the sifter so we can build our sand village.
I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick, a can of beans and a pocketful of dreams.
Mom, you can't get a job. The last time you left Dad home alone, he turned the house into a giant puppet.
Uh... If you get a job, who's gonna feed me and protect me from the evil monkey in my closet?
Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind at all. What the deuce has come over me?
Look at her, Leonard, sitting there with her curly ebony locks and those pouty come-hither lips. My God, she's unappealing.
Ha! I said Will you be my wife? You said yes, so it is official. Let me touch your face.
Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the way to Kentucky to get some fried chicken, and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?
My feet are killing me, I've got vomit in my pocket and I've seen that crappy Julia Roberts movie 47 times!
Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over. The plane has safely landed in Cuba, and all Americans aboard are on their way home, except one couple - a fat man who is inexplicably married to an attractive redhead.
Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies. There'll be dancing, Christmas mornings, and arguments over the proper way to discipline the children, and...
Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm the only one in this thing, I deserve to know.
This is what you call dolled up? Why don't you save yourself years of sexual ambiguity and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens and a plaid flannel shirt?
I had rehearsal for Death of a Salesman,  but we can't show death at school, so now at the end, we dance around with sparklers.
I'm just sayin' that me and my associates will steal your car, and ipso facto your insurance company'll buy you another one.
Lois, can you go down to the basement and do somethin' really loud and complicated for the next 15 minutes?
No, no. I mean, am I George Carlin funny, am I Spin City funny, Rita Rudner funny, what? Come on.
Willy Loman never made a lot of money, his name was never in the paper, but, uh... You know, like, attention could be paid.
I say, Jeremy, isn't that Reginald B Stiffworth, the chap who's been touting the merits of a United European Commonwealth?
Peter, there is no such thing as the Mafia. The don's daughter is getting married tomorrow. Here's my invitation. Now, get the asterisk, percent, ampersand, out of here, you SOB.
Decent phones, God-fearing phones, phones that everybody else gave up on, but we knew better, because we were a team.
Peter, my good friend. How good of you to come and show your respect, on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
See, marriage is a partnership. If you really love someone, you gotta work together, as a team. I... I learned that the hard way.
See, the reason your fleas are drawn to you is your kidney energy is bein' blocked by a dark chi, or what we call in my country wee-fung-chow-hu.
There's only one thing to do-learn the language of the fleas, earn their trust, then breed with their women. In time our differences will be forgotten.
I feel terrible about this. Why don't I put us up in a nice hotel for a couple of days?
You're not fat, Chris, you just come from a long line of husky Griffins, like your great-great-great-uncle Jabba the Griffin.
I'm like a Green Beret, you know. I sneak inside you and I skulk around like it's Vietnam or somethin', and I'm sneakin' through the bush, you know.
I'm ready. Well, time for dessert, isn't it? Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie, and we have something very tasty for big fat you. Bon apptit!
I mean, what kinda lazy, narcissistic, irresponsible moron would even consider doing something as unbelievably foolish as getting liposuction? Who, I ask you? Who?
You know, there's somethin' I always wanted to do, Brian, but, uh... I-I could never do it cos I was so heavy.
Fear not, some day word will reach you about the success of me, the great Eskimo actor Jennifer Love Hewitt.
It doesn't matter if your nose is a little bulbousy, or your eyes are too close together, or your chest is flabby. You are who you are.
You... you've really let this family down. We should be embracin' the things God gave us, not tellin' our kids a person's not as good as someone else because of the way they look.
Here's your introductory basket. It's got lotions, Ferrari sunglasses, and pills to make your bowel movements smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.
Maybe I will. Then I'll put it on my feet and skate on Paul Bunyan's giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!
Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, to Petoria, where first lady Lois Griffin has graciously agreed to give a tour of her country. Tricia.
You think G Gordon Liddy paid for his drinks while he was stranglin' people with piano wire for the good of our nation?
Good morning. I'm Diane Simmons. We now go to Tom Tucker, live at the site of the US blockade. Tom?
Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front, where the US has cut off electricity, water and gas to the tiny four-bedroom republic.
For less that the ticket price of one of my movies about capital punishment or neo-feminism, you can make sure that Stewie never goes hungry again.
Hey, Lois, if you happen to see the dungeon master, tell him his grandmother was tryin' to work me over.
That show is so funny. It really reminds me of me and my friends, how we hang out before I kill them for worshipping the wrong god.
And I love that Kramer guy. He comes in the room like this: Whaaaa... Well, I can't do it, but you know.
Attention, President Griffin. As you may presently, yourself, fully be aware of, my grammar sucks, but more importantly,  we're about to commence
And that's the story of Petoria, a little nation that, 200 years ago, seceded and repatriated in less than a week.
Yes, this is Meg Griffin. She's here to see the dean of admissions and we'd, uh, like it if she got into the university.
Well, actually, I really wanted to go to Wellesley but Mom said I might as well buy hiking boots and call myself a lesbian right now.
That's why I started Stewie's Big and Tall Man Shop. If you're portly or tall, you'll find a friendly atmosphere brimming with personalised and expert service.
If I could build a device to harness the size of that leviathan, there's no limit to what I could... Oh, my God, there's an orgy in my mouth. Got milk? That's a funny one too.
Meg needs something that'll pull those kids away from their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots and their Spirographs and their Moby Grape and their 90210.
Brian, that's it! If I could get a picture of Luke Perry doing something gaylike it'll make people believe Meg's story is true!
Hey, I've gotten people to believe crazier things. And if you are pure of heart and deed you'll all go to a beautiful place called Heaven.
Look here, you gourd-bellied codpiece. Allow me to purchase the provisions I demand or I shall transform your blue collar into a red one and...
We interrupt for breaking news. After years of isolation, the mysterious and eccentric brewmeister, Pawtucket Pat, has said that he's opening his never-before-seen brewery to a lucky few.
Each lucky scroll winner and a guest of their choice will take a magical tour of the brewery, and walk away with a lifetime's supply of beer.
The recipient declines to be interviewed for safety reasons, but I'm sure you're all with me when I say Congratulations, you son of a bitch.
That's right. I made it up. I figured if people thought the last scroll was found, everyone would stop looking, giving me the edge to find it myself.
I was at home nursing this throwing-star wound, my wife Janey gives me a beer, and bam, there it was.
This beer will still be carbonated long after you die of old age and we buy another dog to help the kids, you know, forget about you.
Lois, take a letter. Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you! You are a bad man! And you made me cry. Furthermore...
Wait a second. Rosie, I've just poured this glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter, and you say that Bounty can pick it up in five seconds?
They call this the magic hour: the day's not quite gone, but the night's not quite here, and somewhere, Scott Baio is ploughin' a woman he doesn't love.
The raccoons were here. See? We're a bunch of sneaky animals. We're gonna wreck this food and eat it, cos we're naughty! And then there's a guy. Let's get him in trouble with his dad! Ha ha ha!
Boys, I'm a miracle worker. I have used all my parenting skills to change my son from a lazy slacker into a workin' man.
Oh. Well, at least you have a dad. When I was growin' up, it was just me and my mom.
We are at the 17th hole, where Peter Griffin and Cleveland Junior are five strokes ahead, making victory all but a certainty.
It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy
I must say, I've always dreamed of a life at sea. I'm the greatest captain of the Queen's Navy And your record will stand as proof Be it galley or freighter, I'm an expert navigator And you're also a world-class poof My manner, quite effete, is mistaken on the street for a sailor who can pirouette on cue Well, despite your point of view I can thrill a girl or two But I'd rather get it on with you
Un-freakin'-believable. First we nailed a bastard who had the gall to hide his stuff in his daughter's doll. Her doll!
Freakin' evaporated like a dingy, stinkin' mud puddle. One day you see your reflection in it, and the next day it's a damn oil spot on your cracked driveway staring back at you, mocking you. Blah! Blah! Blah!
Oh, well... It's not as good as my Irish cop. It's just a little thing I... I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up for it by having a very strong upper body.
Brian, I know I don't speak up much, and it's really hard for me to talk about my feelings, but...
Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.
Our goal here is to find your X factor - the element in your life that made you turn to drugs.
Brian, it's moments like this that make me sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do. He was all coked up and we were choked up But now we're happy Brian's home, cha-cha-cha!
Brian's gone to Los Angeles to find himself. It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely?

You are some piece of work, lady. If you... Actually, yes, it is. Greetings from California. I've been very busy. Having a great time trying to make it as a writer in LA. It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. I've been working the room at a lot of Hollywood parties.  Oh!
If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
Every car I hand-wash comes with a smile, an air freshener, and a copy of my coming-of-age teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood, where people are sexy and clever and always say somethin' funny before the commercial break.
Well, I was invited to the premiere of the new, uh... the new Val Kilmer picture, but I'd rather take you out to dinner.
It says here this is the gutter where the policeman fell over laughing after Eddie Murphy said he was just giving the transvestite a ride home.
I've always found your writing a little hackneyed and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?
Peter, slow down. Brian said he was gonna be on the set all day. On the set! Listen to me. Two days in Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.
Your husband's always away on business and you feel isolated and unloved, so you begin to think maybe you should go back to graduate school.
Sorry. I thought the name of the show was Kids Say the Darndest Things, not Old Black Comedians Never Shut the Hell Up.
I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.
My God. I thought I needed to get away from you guys to find what was missing in my life, but the only thing I'm missing is my family.

Louie left his house at 2.15 and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of five miles per hour. What time will Louie arrive?
What about that graph on the wall that says The first thing we want is to get kids to start smoking.
Huh. Then what about that poster that says The graph was not made in art class. We really do want kids to start smoking.
But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean.
So what's this big assignment you got for me, chairman of the broad? Chairman of the broad. When did you become such a stitch?
Don't you remember? You gave me writers. I don't want to say you're rich, but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go 'Whoopee!'
We need someone important like you to go down to Washington and help those bastards see what fun-loving people the tobacco industry's made of.
We have indisputable evidence that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas, you've never been in the same state.

Hurricane Norman is about to pound Quahog. We go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa to see how locals are dealing with the imminent disaster. Tricia?
I know The Drunken Clam was your bar, but you and your friends can find somewhere else to act like idiots.
Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm supposed to say I am so up to it. Ha ha ha.
Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, we'll have to use our superior linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the phrase Hey, check out that flaming queen.
We've got five days left, and I'll not lose my wager. Now repeat after me. Hello, Mother, have you hidden my hatchet?

Yeah. This morning my mom was, like, Don't forget your lunch, and I'm all I'm a flag girl now, I won't forget my lunch, and she's all Don't forget your halftime routine.
In fact, a lot of women prefer them to normal-size bananas, because they're exotic and flavourful and very, very special.
Beautiful to look at, but mess with one of my chicks and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip your eyes out! Cookies are done.
OK. Now we're gonna play Seven Minutes in Heaven, and it's my party, so I want Doug to go in the closet with... Meg.

Before you tee off, here are your complimentary monogrammed bag towels, a sleeve of balls, and this mobile ball cleaner.
What Jughead has done here - and it's quite ingenious actually - is paint pupils on his eyelids so he can sleep through class without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
My Nose out in front, followed by Sea Biscuit, followed by Some Crazy Lady and Middle-Aged Housewife, followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That and Silver Dasher.
We were just about to sing a song about mopping. We're mopping the deck Which is Navy for floor And when we're done mopping We'll mop it some more

The tourists are gone and we have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over.
Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game, and red like the sauce on my mamma mia's gugotz.
Wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.
Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt cos girls don't have anything down there.
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.
I'll go first. Don't listen to your mother, kids. She's worthless and dumb. Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter. I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales, but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs.
Me next, me next! I'm the dog. I'm well-read and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the rug by the door. I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim.
I got a letter from Dad. Dear Meg. For the first four years of your life, I thought you were a house cat.  Dad! Dear Stewie. Get out.  That's nice.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control before we kill each other.

The tourists are gone and we have the town to ourselves before those idiots from New York show up to watch the leaves change and take over.
Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game, and red like the sauce on my mamma mia's gugotz.
Wanna go, tough guy? I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.
Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt cos girls don't have anything down there.
If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats. I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
Oh. Yes, very well. All right. Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your curious indiscretions no longer faze me. Really? And I suppose you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of gin sugars you call buttocks?
I... I know who's responsible for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you, Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
I know I went a little overboard with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have any more anger in this house, OK?
OK. The psychologist wants us to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be the person who makes us angry.

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the joining of these two people in the bonds of holy matrimony, consecrated before God Almighty.
Let me guess. Another colourful box with a crank that I'm expected to turn until - big shock - a jack pops out.
There's a law against teaching the evolutionary theory that Gil Gerard used a time machine and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.
Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are. ...turmoil when President Bush stuck his finger in a socket.
Stay away from me, Neil. Just because we're working together does not mean I like you. Give it to me!
Thank you, Diane. There may have been some commotion on the rooftop, but the real story was inside the mouths of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman, where a meeting of the tongues, a summit of saliva, established a new world order of love.
Just because you're repulsive and the most annoying person on the planet, and I'm not the only one who thinks so, doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.

I gave him some special ointment, and he hurt so bad that he had to apply it in the car with his sock.
I bet you're just a low-level assembly-line guy who stands all day screwing heads on dolls. Ooh, is it on straight? I don't know.  Boo!
Ahem. Cinderella had three wicked step-watermelons who were very smelly to her. So her fairy god-toilet turned a pumpkin into a fanny and sent her off to the poop.
In other news, toy industrialist Jonathan Weed was found dead in the home of an employee who claims Weed choked on a roll.
As you know, we of the Christian faith believe that Jesus is not really dead, but that he must let the world think he is dead until he can find a way to control the raging spirit that dwells within him.
I'm Mr Weed's lawyer. We found this tape among Mr Weed's personal effects with instructions that it be screened immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.
OK, we've got your typing test here and all the pertinent data about your, um... um, you know, your background and, um... skills and...
This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you so hard to invite Mr Weed to dinner, he'd still be alive and you'd have your job.
Yes. I'm trying to overcome my fear of swords because a man in a pirate suit stabbed me in the ear when I was five, and then again when I was 30. And you? The same?
I just wanted to thank you. I don't know if you remember, but when I was a kid, you helped me get my life back on track.
Hey, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker, and there's nothing you can do about it because I'm protected by my impenetrable cereal-box fort. Ha-ha-ha!
I'll be watching him from the stands, because the Black Knight is a big jerk, just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.

I never got a chance to return that sweater Lois gave me for Christmas. The receipt's on top of my bureau. I'm probably over the 30-day return limit, but I'm sure if you make a fuss, they'll give you a store credit or something. It's actually not a horrible sweater. It's just I can't imagine when I would ever wear it. You know? I also left a button on the bureau. I'm not sure what it goes to, but I can never bring myself to throw a button away. I know as soon as I do, I'll find the garment it goes to, and then it'II... Actually, could it have been from the sweater? Did it have buttons? Hm. I should wrap this up before I start to ramble.

Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make... a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back?
But I figured I got a few days of free booze and food... before they kick me off. I could use a vacation.
I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were one of those criminals... who broke in and destroyed my entire stock of acne medication.
Yeah, I mean, I know I was skeptical at first... but I got to be honest, I've never felt this way about anyone before.
Hi. Wasn't sure if you got my last message... or any of the other ones. Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...

Well, Meg, I want you to be with me because you want to be with me... not because you have to.
I have to do laundry, then I have a piano lesson... then I have to make dinner. I am so busy. Better hurry.

Lois, I got your new headshots, and I set up a shoot for you... over at Glamour next Monday... but, sugar, you're gonna need these to stay on top.
Lois, if you being a modeI means you're going to be eye-candy... for the whole town, then I ain't going for it.
Now, then. I'm going to do something I call the compliment sandwich... where I say something good, then talk about where you need improvement... and then end with something good.

You know, Brian, there was a note in the suggestion box that says: Stewie should eat a steaming bag of...
Well, now that you say you're fine with it... to be honest, I'm not really sure I wanna do it anymore.
I think all I really wanted was the freedom to know I could... and now I have it because I have you.
If I drive, I'll have to have a bunch of drinks first... because I am very self-conscious about my driving.
My God, you know, if I could just take all the orphans in the world... and just, you know, buy a farm somewhere... and let them all run free, you know.

His sweater was neatly folded on the grave... so we went back to the car... and the severed hook was hanging from the door handle... because the calls were coming from inside the house.
Listen, I'm sorry for everything that's happened between us... and I figure, I don't know, I thought maybe we could be friends again, huh?
You know, it's bad enough that Peter and I were fighting... but ever since he met James Woods, it's like I don't even exist.
Do you really care about a man who used to try and pick up girls... at the Miss USA Pageant?
Brian, I know you're upset now, but if there's anything I've learned in this life... is that you can't let the little things...
If I whispered in your ear that Commander Worf's head... looks like a fanny, would you join me in a laugh?

Come on, Karen. Do you hate your body so much... you have to reduce every painting of the female form to pornography?
I'm going to teach you the lesson that it is not okay to be a freshman. all right, Mr. Griffin. Jobs you think you would be suited for.
Oh, my God. This one time, we got so baked... we ended up eating all the food the World Health Organization... had airlifted in. Man, those villagers were so pissed.
Hey, how you doing? Give me a word, any word at all... and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickeI.

Hi, and welcome to The Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour, a wonderful look back on all the partial nudity network television used to offer.
Norman Mailer will read an excerpt from his latest book, and we have a girl from Omaha who's hiding a banana.
Guess that's it. You probably want me out of your hair, so here's the Drano in case there's a clog.
It's one thing if a network runs inappropriate shows I can't do anything about, but I won't have it happening in my house.
Until you and all of Quahog start to clean up your act, like when Ozzy Osbourne stopped biting heads off bats.
You know what I mean - when you... lubed up... toothpaste in my... cherry... Episcopalian... extension cord... wetness... with a parking ticket - that is the best.
I know it's a little extreme, but when it comes to our children, it's better to err on the safe side, right?
No. You know, if everybody was as closed-minded as you, the world wouldn't have some of its most inspired creations.
This government's FCC is trying to take the farts away from television, and all the sex and nudity and all the poop.
And the Pentagon? Well, you look me in the eye and tell me it doesn't look like a big anus.
This is gonna be a fun day. Much better than that day I tried TAG body spray for sick cats.
OK, everyone, Alan Thicke will be up in a minute to answer your hate mail, but first, the winners of this year's costume contest, the A-Team with the real black guy.
I read your article too. You should spend less time working for the paper and more time working on that novel you've been working on.
If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.
Oh, Brian, how droll. We'll have to put that into a cartoon, or as we call it, an illustrated laughing square.
Louis, the French people really wanna thank you for your services as king, but, it's just not working out and we've decided to go another way, so...
If this is Mom, send money because we're college students and we need money for books and highlighters and ramen noodles and condoms for sexual relations with our classmates.
Only way I'll pass is if I cheat. If I do, what was the point of coming back to college?
That's exactly it. We didn't stay focused. I mean, we were right there, and then we just... Somehow we just... I mean... It...
I couldn't do it. I thought I'd be able to finish this time, but I just don't have what it takes to be a college graduate.
What's the point? I thought I could help people with this A-Team thing, but it turns out I'm as useless as that nude Playboy spread of Debbie Gibson.
Doesn't matter how it turned out. I finished what I started, which means I have my pride, and that's something.
Stewie's really been acting out a lot at home and I was just wondering, how's he been behaving at school?
At the end of the day, if you're exhausted and your face is wet, it means you did a good job.
Listen, things here aren't working out any more, and I was wondering, can I come live with you and Janet for a while?
Peter, when I said bond with Stewie, this is not what I had in mind. I am furious with you.
I feel awful. We were getting along and now he hates me. How do I get him to like me?
Fat man, I'm not sure how to say this without sounding cheesy, but, well, you really came through for me today, so I...
HÃ¤gar the Horrible, if you keep up that lifestyle of pillaging and turkey legs, you'll be dead in a month.
Toss the ball, catch it in the cup, dump it out of the cup, toss it, and catch it in the cup again.

If we get Stewie baptised, you and all other old people have to acknowledge and be aware there's crap in the corners of your mouth.
Mr and Mrs Griffin, I've examined your son and he is suffering from toxic anaemia, which has weakened his immune system.
At least you're in no danger, since you only visit church to leave your self-delivered, half-dead newborns on the step.
He would travel from place to place putting things right that once went wrong and hoping each time that his next leap would be the leap home.
Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment. It's a portal, an opening, through which all light, rejuvenation, joy and ecstasy may enter the human form.

I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back, and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai are gonna take you down, man!
See you, Lois. And like I tell you every day, if I come back in the afternoon and you're having sex with somebody, I'll kill you both. Thanks to effective treatments, Magic Johnson down to one AID.
It was amazing. I got to tell you, he said some things that were exactly what I needed to hear and I was just inspired to get up on that stage. Gotta live life for today, you know.
And I say, Those are my father's cards. You can't leave them there. He's gonna be mad.  Where am I?

Managed to pull it out of the deer's mouth and put it in some ice I got at a 7-Eleven.
My God, you're as transparent as your father was when he pretended to be a Hassidic Jew to get off work.
I went into a store last week and they wanted 800 bucks for a TV, but I ussed them down to 500.

You know, Brian, as smart as you are, you've got to accept that there are some things in life that you just can't control.

What do you think, Mike? I mean, if you saw action going on in front of you, would you know instinctively to centre it?

We will blitz the competition, and in no time, you'll be driving your new Hyundai or Subaru right to a touchdown.
I say, Jenkins, you give me that dirty look one more time, and I've a good mind to get into my PJ's and have a pillow fight with you.
All right, players, the answer once again is: It was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of Mars.
Unless the next words out of your mouth are directions how to get back to the fish skeleton, I'm going to punch you right in the stomach.
You know what?! That's what I'm going to do! I'm going to go on strike, and you can all try living without me! What do you think about that, huh?!
You see, the areola is very tender here, and I think one of his new teeth may have bitten down right on the duct.
Uh... any, any other problems you have, too, like, for example, around your underpants... that you want me to take a look at, I could, I could take a look at that, too.
You know this place is unique because if you're lucky, some nights around sunset, the screaming black dolphins come out.
Of course it's clear. Every American has the right to hang a pair of bear arms on their wall. How could that possibly be misconstrued?
Joan and I always say, if you don't have anything nice to say about someone don't say anything at all. We say that, right, honey?
You think this is just: Oh, here comes Peter with the Statue of Liberty's foot? Oh, isn't that a gas? No, no. The reality, the real reality of getting this together was staggering.
So, anyway, what I'm trying to tell you is, uh... some of the guys thought we should get a divorce.
Wait a second. We know she's gonna be upset if you dump her, but if something happened that was out of your control...
So, anyway, here's Quagmire walking through the park minding his own business. I just happened to be there with my video camera, when a ninja shows up!
You go for a walk in the park one day and wheel chair ninjas and Nazis and pots-and-pans robots show up to kill you and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.
I can use my helm of disintegration, and do One-D-Four damage as my half-elf mage wields his plus five holy avenger.
Although, I got to tell you, I was, uh, kind of getting used to the idea of having a little brother or sister.
Peter, it's the male equivalent of a woman getting her tube's tied, except it's actually a lot quicker and safer.
There is absolutely zero chance that I spilled all the jars and had to refill them with my own sperm.
I got to go meet Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire down at the bar, so, uh, just put my dinner in the fridge, and I'll heat it up later.
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're, like... it's better than yours, damn right, it's better than yours I could teach you, but I'd have to charge.
You start with five pounds, and then one day, boom, you wake up, and you're on The Practice with sixteen rings in your ear.
It's quite simple, actually. You press the smiling duck to take off, the cow with the bow tie to fire weapons, and the clown face is just a clown face, enjoy it.
We've got to fight him over there by the swing set, so we don't have to fight him here at the sandbox.
He's got a clown costume in his trunk, so we know he's good with kids, and pictures of boys in their underwear, so he's probably had some medical training.
Ever since I was a little boy, people have enjoyed the sound of my voice, and I figured you either get busy talkin' or you get busy dyin'.
The wall is covered with something that resembles egg crates, except they're soft and spongy, like a Twinkie... like a Twinkie.

Well, it was a tough job removing all that fat to get to your heart, Mrs Griffin, but you came through it beautifully.
You know, Meg, that guy's been playing fast and loose with his position for years now, and I've had it. He's a corrupt bastard.
Hey, now, Peter, you gotta remember that when we used to write the old songs, we had a lot of inspiration, huh?
No, no, no, I actually came to my senses, and realized I was out of line. Uh, I'm just here to apologize.
Well, uh, you two are busy being nude. So, uh... we'll just, uh, head out and, uh... let you be nude.
In a moment, we will use the special lights to see just how filthy this seemingly clean hotel room really is.
I am going to the press with this story, and when it hits, it'll be bigger than Uncle Sam's nipples.
Uh, married a black fella, which is quite a surprise because I'd call her quite a catch, and black guys, by and large, they're not so helpful on a fishing vessel.

You know, when she tugged her ear at the end of that show, she was really saying good-night to her mom.
I got to tell you, I've read 4 chapters of this, and it's not sexy at all. Much Ado About Humping.  Well, sounds sexy.
Hey, guys, tell me if this letter sounds all right. Dear Reek Publishing, I was highly disappointed by your erotic novel. Here's what I would've wrote: It was past midnight when the blonde, smokin'- hot lab assistant who looked a little like Heather Locklear, only with bigger jugs, was grabbed and thrown on to the lab table. He ripped off her lab coat, and she grabbed his metallic extension. Oh, did I mention he was a robot? Cause that's kind of important. Yeah, a robot. Awesome.
I'm no school administrator, but there's an extension program going on in my trousers. And then Captain Leroy Hot Dog' Zanzibar and Gina from my work got in the backseat of his really cool spaceship. Gina was finally wearing that tank top I got her and nothing else. Zanzibar knew he couldn't control his space horniness any longer, and then they totally did it. And if I'd have been there, I would've been, like, Ah, sweet.
Listen, uh, Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're a businessman, I'm a businessman, and I've got a proposal that I guarantee you can't refuse.
Chapter One. Oh, God, you should've seen this one hot chick. She was totally Italian. Or maybe some kind of Spanish.
Well, it's not real fur. It's actually made from bald eagle, and it's weather-treated with a mixture of whale skin oil and children's tears.
Listen, I know you're upset about losing your money, so I wanted to show you it's not so bad living like a regular guy.
Trust me, it makes it that much more special when we finally get inside and see Renee Zellweger doing her whole scrunch-face routine.
The bus smells like crap, the movie theater is sticky, and Renee Zellweger should only be the cute friend at best.
Hey, Meg, uh, we're trying to make some money and, um... would you like to buy some pot from your granddaddy and me?
All I know is, there's a lot of money to be made in these stupid teen dramas they keep putting on TV.
Well, we do have... we got Total, and we got some raisins. I mean, you could, like, mix those together. It'd be... it'd be kinda like Raisin Bran.
No, no. No room at all. But, lucky for you, there's a big new airport out in the middle of the ocean.
Five hours on my moneymaker, sitting across from a gaggle of sailors flying home on leave, here I am in a committed relationship, and all I can think about is having a piece of Navy cake.
I can think of no greater tribute to their memories than this solid gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks frog.
The spirit of America is epitomized by his inspiring motto: Smack, smack, Sugar Smack. Gimme a smack, and I'll smack you back.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to announce extreme budget cutbacks having almost nothing to do with this solid-gold statue.
Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something. When you're in the shower at the Y, is that just like Supermarket Sweep for you guys, or is there some kind of etiquette?
And the speech thing, and what you're doing with your eye... uh, you had a stroke about seven years ago.
Oh, you hear that, Meg? Guys can marry other guys now. So... um... this is awkward, but, uh... I mean, if they can do that, that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
I'm here at the parking lot outside City Hall, where hundreds of citizens have come out in protest of the Mayor's decision to spend the town's treasury on a gold frog.
Sorry, little man. Ricardo and I were playing Clue, and he got me in the bedroom with a lead pipe.
All I ever wanted was to get married and make a home with a skinny, hairless Filipino boy. Isn't that the American dream?
I'm a very open-minded person, and I've never had any problem with gays before, but something about two gay people getting married, I just don't think it's right.
Well, regardless of what you think, this is going to change Mayor West's mind, and we are going to have Jasper's wedding here.
I still kick myself for missing that Topless Cheerleader Parade with the hundred-foot chocolate teddy bear and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics choreographed to the music of Queen.
I've been up for 24 hours, I paid off a few people and I did a few things in West Quahog I'm not proud of.
I have a tiny bullet-proof shield the exact size of a bullet somewhere on my body. And if you hit it,
So two straight people who hate each other have more of a right to be together than two gay people who love each other?
So people will know if they step into my yard, there's only one way out... in a body bag... from dog injuries.
Uh, Lois, have you, uh, noticed some spooky things going on ever since Peter brought that skull into the house?
Oh, I must have accidentally stacked all those things upside down and then just forgot about it. Yeah, that's probably what happened.
Well, how about you and my father go and hang out at the gun range some afternoon and you can spend the whole day just agreeing with each other.
We just got to be patient, Lois, like waiting on the results of a blood test, a real important blood test.
I went in there once and there was a guy with a harelip eating soup, and I was like, Ew... '
I mean, I guess there's only, like, a one in 50 chance of me getting the same spoon that he had, but I still don't like them odds.
If Stewie can't find his way out of Meg's ass, we have to enter the other realm and get him ourselves.
We pissed off a bunch of ghosts, and now our house is gone and we got no place to stay.
It's an avocado pit with a little bit of avocado still on it, and that comes on a ripped pair of boxer shorts.
Now, I'm trying to decide between the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper and the half yogurt with the balled-up tissue in it.
I normally have, like, a case with all my... little props and gadgets and what not, but... it's okay, you can use your imagination, like maybe a piece of luggage, that shoots dog biscuits, so, like, if you had, like, weed in your bag and you went to the airport, you could shoot the dog biscuits out, and then, the drug dog would be... would go away from your bags, kind of... if you can imagine the dog... the dog...
Once again, you brought our family to the edge of the abyss, and at the very last minute, you saved us all.
After that, a meteor hit the Earth turning it into a block of ice for some reason, but then it thawed and cavemen came.
Commandment number four: When we pass a billboard, please don't read it out loud.  All right? Now, come on, let's get going.
It all began in Africa in the tiny village of Quahog-swana where he was a proud member of the tribe of Tootie-an-Blair.
Not today, Joemama. I'm going off to find a log to build a drum so I can play the opening part from Hot For Teacher.
If we can break out of here, I've got an idea how to give the captain of this boat what he deserves.
It was way down there. You know, when you stop seeing Howard Johnson's and you start seeing Stuckey's. Anyway, it was a horrible place where they took away everybody's African names and gave them new names.
With an accent over the I, and a little lineover the O so you know it's a long vowel sound and not a short one.
The quarters are too crowded, the hours are long and... you know, I don't like to be this guy, but... a couple of the overseers have been making racial slurs.
As a poet might say, she was the kind of woman you just want to have sex with over and over.
That's right, Diane. We're looking at Nate Griffin and Al Cowlings the man we believe to be Al Cowlings. We'll stay with the chase.
After that, Nate devoted his life to getting back at the white man for the injustice of slavery, by inventing the Department of Motor Vehicles.
I might as well tell you about my great grandfather, who was the greatest silent movie star of the '20s.
They spent their idle time cavorting, doing the Charleston and enjoying America's prosperity following World War I, which, at that time, was called International Civil War II.
Well, it sure would suck if you guys died without hearing the story of my great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was Adolf's favorite brother.
You know what? You guys, with your marching and your letters and your phone calls, this is all thanks to you. You made this happen, you guys... My God! Give yourselves a round of applause! Come on.
Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged according to size from largest to smallest, and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.
I only went in there for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval, but I turned out to be the guinea pig, for a sexual experimentation.
But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman, beloved family doctor to all of Quahog, is the target of a molestation lawsuit.
And I suppose it wouldn't matter if I told you for the 50th time that it's a legitimate medical procedure to test for cancer.
Okay, everybody, uh, I know you were expecting something else, but as science will tell you, people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.
Okay, so if we can all be mature... give me the gum, we can all get through this a lot faster.
We could call it, like, like, strawberry sunset or ginger maiden, o-o-or-or one of those hair color names that's a random noun, like like temptress.
I'm like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage by holding him underwater. I'm just like Barbara Bush!
I mean, I have, uh, sort of been hitting the gym, so uh, if-if you wanted to see how it's going...
Okay, and, um, number three could you say, Julie, I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives.
And if you think you can say that just like Weenie here, you could win 97.1 dollars for the cool weekend ahead.
Um, yes, that turkey, that- that raw turkey that you ate off the counter last week that got Lois mad, when you pooped that out was the timer still in there?
I was on my way in here to cancel your show, but the banter you did with that guy, well, as we say in the radio business, If you put that on the radio, people will listen to it!
In my view, as good as the Yankees were in the first half of this game, that's how as bad they've been now.
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker trying to get back on my feet after having my ass handed to me by my bitch of an ex-wife.
All right, this is my show, and it's a serious, intellectual hour of discussion and I want to keep it that way.
Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment for you, but all I want is for your mom to be happy.
Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do my best to make her even happier than those kids on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.
How about the first three women willing to come down and have sex with Hank get free boob jobs courtesy of Dr. John Viener?
But no matter how you come to judge, Charles Wheeler and his partners' unethical, moral, and inhuman terms, the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law.
We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon, and for every hot dog that you catch in your mouth, you get a $100 toward a boob job that you desperately need.
Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk?
You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on, you got to get your car home.
And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official.
Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs up against glass in public just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill!
What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months, but she gets a freakin' car just like that?!
We come in here wanting a practical car, but then you dangle this tank in front of me and expect me to walk away.
Now, I may be an idiot, but there is one thing I am not, sir, and that, sir, is an idiot.
Yeah, right. You hate all megastores, ever since you were petted way too hard by that special boy in front of Kmart.
You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime, no health benefits, and every day at 3:00, you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.
Contrary to those upbeat lyrics, the Electric Company would like us to emphasize it will not be bringing you the power.
When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation... that I'm standing on a mountain top with the wind blowing through my hair.
I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA, while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat.
Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this, but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable of performing the simplest tasks.
Take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and before you know it, you'll be up on your roof; pooping in the chimney.
Don't worry, Lois, all he needs is an after-school activity to get his mind off the army. Just something to distract him.
I just want to swing by the army recruiting center and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.
Well, actually, yeah, your last little, uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie, that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny.
And we are gonna rock this place until... un... well, until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over!
You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack, or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their toothbrushes.
Ever since you hooked up with this band, you're like a completely different person, and I don't like it one bit.
But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate, or none of you graduate. Griffin, it's up to you.
Listen to these lyrics. I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches. I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits.
Oh, look, they've got a translation for white people : I give 110 percent when it comes to helping my community, even though I occasionally associate with some less than reputable characters.
You're right, we got to find this Marilyn Manson and I got to give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis.
Uh, we both got shot in the foot, so, uh, we figured an honorable discharge would be in order and, uh, you could just send us back to the States.
And I just wanted to tell you, rock n' roll music is cool, but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to.
And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen is with a healthy breakfast rich in breads and grains.
They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal.
Oh, boy, I tell you, I haven't felt this good since I came up with that new place to hide my porn.
But a moron with large breasts you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars, or whatever it is grown-ups do with large breasts.
Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning, I call my friend Cleveland and he describes every scene from You, Me, and Dupree.
Lois, take a letter. Dear Life Cereal, Where do you get off? Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious? Who do you think you are? By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically and have nothing but good things to say about what you do. Life Cereal, do not change a thing. Signed, Peter Griffin. Dictated but not read.
Ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On. You must be so brooding and deep.
But just tell me this, Brian : does she laugh on her own or does she laugh only when you laugh?
Uh, so, yeah, um... so I figured we could get together tonight and maybe, um, do all those things sexually that we usually do.
You know, it's no wonder you're so far behind in your work if this is how you behave at the office.
Geez, Lois, I thought having you here was gonna be fun, but so far you're a bigger buzzkill than Buzz Killington.
And then, think about this : have you ever seen the sun and the moon in the same place at the same time?
Well, I just think, for starters, that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us and, truthishly, we should just accept that.
Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to Penthouse Forum, and I don't wanna be made a liar in the nudie magazine of record.
Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week, and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office.
And sometimes, just for the hell of it, she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair and places it gently on your tongue.
Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's.
Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me again.
Fine, but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson when he tries to play an American cowboy.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class.
Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up, but, watch carefully. If I move this down here, and this over here, and this part here...
Dad, look at the facts about sex. If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension populated entirely by dogs who will eat it.
Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent, but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count.
Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.
Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade, and this is how we choose to express our love.
I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose?
Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far, prompting a new slogan : Once you go black, you go deaf.
Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but, yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors just like Harry Houdini.
But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins with today's announcement that Tasty Juice will be dropping her as their spokesperson and replacing her with a new ad campaign featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians, as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
I mean those big, Oh, my God, here they come, floatin' around, making noise gay guys, not the fix up your house gay guys.
I can't understand what the devil he's saying, but you know, there's a lot of movement, and it's bright and colorful, it keeps my attention.
Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face. I mean, she's a woman now, Brian. So sophisticated, so grown up, and she says she wants a grown-up man. But...
No. If I was being mean, when you opened the door I would have said, Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia.
Just standing there smelling his hand? What is that? What is that on my hand? Is that... is that barbecue sauce? When was I near barbecue sauce?
It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz, is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has uncurable chick cancer.
Uh, sure. Idea for a novel : guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.
Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh... it's been a long one.
Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip, but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel, so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.
At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns, but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff, and before I knew Vageena Hertz.
Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.
Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know?
Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that?
Joan Wilder's sister is being held hostage in Cartagena, and there's not a policeman in sight. I guess it's up to me.
Our top story : Mayor West has dispatched the entire Quahog police force to Cartagena, Columbia, to assist in the rescue of fictional 1984 movie character,
Um, I heard you didn't have a date to the dance, and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me.
Well, we have started an emergency training program at the Police Academy, but I'm not sure that you're cut out for the job.
So, you pick on Meg to avoid the inevitable realization that once your body's used up by age 19, you're going to be a worn-out, chalky-skinned burlap sack that even your step dad won't want. How's that? Am I in the ballpark?
Now we can do this one of two ways. I can bust your balls to pieces right now, or we can spread it out over the course of the day.
Sir, I suspect you are in possession of drugs, and I'm going to have to give you a full cavity search. Drop your pants.
You know, I thought about how you stood up for me at the dance, and all the nice things you said.
I don't think that's gonna be a possibility. I have... plans, um... with Chris. Chris and I have plans this afternoon.
Look, this has gone a little too far. I like you. I think you're great, but what happened at the dance was...
Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. And... hey, look, I wanted to thank you for being so great to me.
Yeah, well, the thing is, Meg is becoming a little enamored with me, and I'm kind of losing control of the situation.
I don't know what the hell happened between you two, but you'd better go upstairs and straighten it out right now.
I like to watch her strip and pretend she's a woman who I've never met, but who looks just like Bonnie and lives in my house.
Mom, is it bad if I saw Meg tie up Brian last night, put him in the trunk of his car and then drive away?
Yeah, Brian, you're doing the same thing that Mia Farrow did to that Oriental guy that Woody Allen brought home from the circus.
Peter, hold on to that thought, because I'm going to explain to you when we get home all the things that are wrong with that statement.
Now you probably just think of me as square old Mr. Quagmire from next door, but I've been around the block a few times, learned a couple things, and I can tell you this, there's no reason to grow up too fast.
I can see why a relationship looks glamorous, but you've got all the time in the world and a lot of wonderful experiences ahead of ya.
Coming up at 11:00, Quahog police return to active duty after giving up the search for fictitious Romancing The Stone character
We got reckless driving, disturbing the peace, plus the driver of one of the other cars was a virgin whose hymen was busted by the airbag, so rape.
Well, this is your own fault, Peter, and if you want my opinion, a little time away from the bar will do you some good.
All right, all right! Geez, Lois, I'm just trying to amuse myself, since I don't have a damn driver's license.
Yeah, well, when greyhounds start running The New York Times and the World Bank, I'll be more inclined to believe you.
I would say that, given the events that preceded it, the couple hundred years or so, maybe we're about even.
Are you kidding, Meg? I've had more fun with you than I did going to see Lost in Translation with Cleveland and Quagmire.
You know, calling you names, reading your diary, farting in your cereal when you go to get milk and then laughing : Ha-ha ha! She doesn't know she's eating my fart.
Certainly. That's Robert Loggia. R as in Robert Loggia, O as in Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia, B as in By God, that's Robert Loggia, E as in everybody loves Robert Loggia, R as in Robert Loggia, T as in Tim, look over there, it's Robert Loggia, space, L as in Look, it's Robert Loggia...
Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake, and the guy wants to know how old Meg is. I didn't know what to tell him.
You know, we're gonna have to talk to her and kind of steer the conversation in a way that gets her to spill it.
Well, I hate to side with your father, Peter, but you do kind of drink a lot, and, you know, sometimes it affects the people you love.
Oh, what's this? Hot Monogamy, the board game for failing marriages. Dare card : Have her do a strip tease and see how long it takes you to get a bonner.
All I know is somewhere in the great land of Ireland, is a big fat bastard who looks like me.
If I can just get her to hit me one more time, it'll give me the rush I've been looking for!
What's next? What's next? Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty, and I need to be taught a lesson and you're the one to do it.
Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the hills are green, the streams are clear, and the sweaters are so thick, even the boniest-fingered nun could poke you in the chest and it wouldn't bother you none.
Boy it's amazing, isn't it? You get two fathers and neither one of them wants anything to do with you.
Wait a minute, Brian, that's it! I'm a fat stinkin' drunk because my father is a fat stinkin' drunk. I gotta prove it to him.
I have gotta drink him so far under the table, he'll have no choice but to respect me. Get me a beer, Brian.
Francis may not have been your father, but he raised you as if you were his own. And if that isn't love,
Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate yourself to the back of the line with your feet and stand there with your shirt?
Legs probably spread a little wider than they ought to be, but who gives a damn? This is just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.
I'll do it, Lois. Right after a healthy breakfast of juice, toast and store brand imitation frosted flakes featuring Terry the Tiger.
Oh, just a few friends over to enjoy this gorgeous weather, and maybe take a dip in the pool. Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.
And the sooner you get that through your thick skull, the sooner we can get this marriage back on track.
You know, I always used to be the nerd getting bullied, but doing it to someone else was pretty sweet.
Well, the mole looks benign, but we won't know for sure whether it's cancerous until the tests come back in a few days.
Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy. They will do what you want because they know, they know what you want.
Now, I've made a list of things I want to do before I die and you've got to help me since this is all your fault. Visit Chicago Museum of Art.
I see you there lurking on the periphery of my vision, but when I try to look at you, you scurry away.
I thought it'd feel good to be a bully, but all I did was make people feel as bad as Randy made me feel.
I mean, you know, unless I get really stinkin' drunk, in which case all you got to do is outrun your sister.
Meg, I'm a redneck, which means I am about to do something to you that you will not remember until you're 40.
My Pet Goat. Page one. You know, said my pet goat, I'm sure, if I watched Grey's Anatomy, I'd like it, but I just don't have the time. You should make the time, said the farmer.
Our top story : There was drama in the skies of Quahog today, as a Trans National 767 was forced to make a crash-landing.
That's right, Diane. As if the world weren't already scary enough, it seems you can't even get on a plane safely these days.
Now here's how it would've looked if the plane had crashed into a school for bunnies but one passenger had survived, gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.
No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to siphon jet fuel from an active runway with the intention of flying a pickup truck.
Oh, come on, Marlee, I know you can't hear them, but you got to feel those things slapping out of there!
Hang on to something, 'cause this ride's about to get rougher than dating a hot girl with a bad laugh.
He said : You know, I've got a 13-inch member... and Glenn Quagmire is the best damn pilot I've ever seen.
You bet he did... right before he died a very painful, AIDS-related death from having unprotected sex with so many people.
All right, now do you see a button that looks like a drunken gay guy eyeing you from across the bar?
Coming up : Why calling every Asian man you meet Chung King can land an anchorman in hot water. After this.
We'll start off your workout with vigorous calisthenics executed in rhythmic time with acetate pressings of the new musical craze called jazz.
Look, Lois told me I had to start using the toilet and you're the one who's had potty training, so
I'm just writing a letter to my boyfriend. Dear, my boyfriend, Thank you for making out with me recently on purpose. That was cool. Those flowers that you totally sent me were really pretty, just like you said I am. Love, Meg.
Meg, you are so full of crap. You're like those people who sit in Starbucks and publicly write on their laptops.
When you get out of here, I'm going to take you out and show you the time of your life.
Peter, that pig... could be in our stomachs in, like one minute, and then we could... and then... and then we could do other stuff.
They see your diaper and think : Ew! That dog is sick. He must be dying. I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet. Why don't they just put him to sleep?
I mean, Peter, the man presided over the longest economic expansion in US history, and he reduced the percentage of Americans on welfare to its lowest level in 33 years.
Apparently, there's the side of Bill Clinton the world knows, and then there's the dark, sex-crazed side only I know.
Look, Peter, I know this is a very difficult time for you, but I want you to know I'm here for you if you need anything.
Well... the way I figure it, the only way to even things out between us is if you have sex with someone else, too.
Well, that's the thing. I mean, there's only two phones in the... well, in the world, and one of them is in my office, and the other's in your office, and those two didn't even exist until about a few hours ago.
I haven't been so struck by a woman's beauty since I was Uma Thurman's eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.
So you can go ahead and say what you're going to say, and my natural response could be to get offended.
You have no idea where I come from, where I've been, how long I've been there, what I had to do to get from where I was to where I am now!
Your pajamas created a charge of electricity when you dragged your feet across the carpet, and when you touched Chris, you passed it on.
I got to tell you, you're pissing me off worse than when I watched the O.J. verdict with my old roommate.
Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess, when you called me I sort of misunderstood what you were asking for.
All right, Violet and Pigpen, you've been seeing each other a few weeks now. What seems to be the problem?
Oh, God. I hope there's not one of those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys with the bandana on his head. Oh! There he is.
That's right, Diane. If you're handicapped, or know someone who's handicapped, or just happen to be a fan of the circus, then come on down to Big Pete's House of Munch, where the elite without feet meet to eat.
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid he'll never walk again... without remembering how lucky he is that he'll only be in this wheelchair for two weeks.
I thought you and your friends were just a bunch of gross cripples, but I've been in a wheelchair for 45 minutes now, and I see how tough it is.
Well, Peter, it's been a rough week for both of us, but it means a lot to me to hear you say that.
Well, finally! Some of us have been waiting all evening for a certain wife to come home and feed her starving family.

I was about to bone my girlfriend out at the lake, but suddenly she yelled, so I looked up and it was bigfoot.
Then I went back to bone her, but the mosquitoes were going crazy, and she said there was no way.
At the top of the news tonight, authorities have called off their pursuit of a fugitive Rhode Island baby who was thought to be possessed by the devil.
This turn of events came after Vatican scientists announced today that the devil is not the greatest threat to salvation due to last week's discovery of the Superdevil.
The Superdevil is at least six inches taller, he has a flying motorcycle and a jar of marmalade that we believe forces you to commit adultery.
He is a graceful, majestic creature who is a part of this family and only wants you to love and respect... The horse may have pooped in the bed.
Well, the cheers is when they generally approve of something on television, and jeers is when they find some sort of fault with it.
I agree, Lois. Like, for instance, if you're watching a TV show and you decide to take your values from that, you're an idiot.
Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids watch certain shows in the first place if you have such a big problem with them, instead of blaming the shows themselves.
You know, Ted, don't you think it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s to always be talking about getting married rather than getting laid?
And with a name like The Nutcracker I thought, Oh, this will be worth a few yuks, but no, Lois, that title wrote a check that those queers on stage refused to cash.
I have a history test today, Mom, and I couldn't study last night because you made us go to the ballet.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but the No Child Left Behind law cost us our federal funding because our students' test scores were too low.
Our curriculum consists of being on boats for long periods of time with men, just men for many days at a time.
I guess I just convinced myself things would work out for him, but with no education, what kind of future can he possibly have?
Chris got expelled from James Woods High, and, well, I was wondering if you could get him into that fancy boarding school you went to.
The Skull and Bones Society has been a part of my family for decades, and we want you to become a member.
The first Thursday of every month we go to a local orphanage, pick out a kid, fill out all the paperwork and then don't take him home. It's hilarious.
As is customary with all our new members, you now have to spend seven minutes in the closet with our most senior member.
Now remember, kids, when we get to Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch anything before I have a chance to disinfect it.
Which leads many political analysts to ask the question, Can a woman really be mayor, or will she just menstruate all over the city? Stay with us.
Hi, I'm going door-to-door to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin who's offering real change for the city of Quahog.
I mean, Lois is my wife, and if she's the mayor we can pretty much do whatever the hell we want.
Ma'am, I know that you're going through a difficult time right now, but I just have a few more questions.
Are you aware that Lois Griffin has a plan to cut property tax in half over the next three years?
Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel about those computer websites that put a blue square on the home of a sex offender?
And I think we all realize the importance of stopping the environmental damage being done to Lake Quahog, which is why I'm proposing a very modest tax increase that will help us to...
At the top of the news, Lake Quahog is once again clean, thanks to the efforts of newly elected mayor, Lois Griffin.
Besides, there was a lot left over after the lake cleanup and I figured maybe I earned a little treat, huh?
All I ask in return is that you let my company do just a little bit of dumping in your lake.
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Quahog Oil Refinery, we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin for our newest waste pipe.
All right, now I want you to meet me at this address in an hour, and we'll slap five there.
I figured Scott Baio was androgynous enough that we could both fantasize about him, and no one would be gay.
Lois, we got the rest of our lives for me to not hear a word you just said, but tonight, I got plans with Cleveland.
Now, at some point during that evening, you did something that changed the course of your history, causing the time line to skew off into an alternate tangent, where you're married to Molly Ringwald,
You ever hear the theory that if you kill a butterfly in the past, it can drastically alter the present?
Hey, did you guys hear on the news about President Gore hunting down and killing Osama Bin Laden with his bare hands?
I mean, there was a time back when we dated that I thought you might be the one, but as I recall, you were more interested in partying with your friends.
Dick Cheney, the chairman of Halliburton, shot Supreme Court Justice Scalia in a hunting accident, and the bullet went right through him and killed Karl Rove and Tucker Carlson.
And not Quagmire or any man, she-male, robot or sentient robot curious about its own existence is going to keep you from me!
I got a better one. This is a story of love and loss, fathers and sons, and the foresight to retain international merchandising rights.
(Darth Vader) My God, look at this mess! Darth Vader's gonna be here. Shall we clean up? No, it's OK, he won't mind.
Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they obtained.
Well, I mean, there's this little hole - it was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect - and if you shoot a laser into this hole, the station blows up.
Lord Vader, your inside references to the Los Angeles real estate market haven't given you the clairvoyance to turn a profit on that condo in Glendale. Nor...
And if that weren't enough to get you mad, we now have news that Lando Calrissian has been made the chief administrator of the Bespin Mining Facility.
This is just, like, logistical stuff. I'll check that later. ... Joey Lawrence haircut. So I'll assume we can count on your help to get the Death Star plans to my father on Alderaan.
Hi. My sexy friend and I are looking for a ship to take us to Alderaan, and I'm willing to pay big money.
Well, you've come to the right place. I'm Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon, and the only actor whose career isn't destroyed by this movie.
While some view the attack as unwarranted, the Empire has obtained proof that Alderaan was in possession of weapons of mass destruction.
You know, Luke, this may be the last time we see each other, so there's something I want you to know.
And do you, Alan, take Judith to be your lawfully wedded wife, till death or a giant explosion do you part?
You know what? I know we have a dangerous job to do here, but I'm taking this. I'm taking this couch.
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler. It's easier than we're making it.
You know that last drill we had? I was about to finally bone my girlfriend, then we heard that there was this drill and she told me there was no way.
I mean, sometimes the brain is still active for a few minutes after the beheading, but to be honest, I can't imagine a worse kind of hell.
And unfortunately, hell is probably where he'll end up, because the Christians don't look too kindly on the whole Force thing.
Thanks to the information in this R2 unit provided by Princess Leia, we should be able to mount a successful offensive on the Death Star.
There are gonna be so many folks coming at you to slow you down, you might feel like you got a bull's-eye on your head.
Also, don't forget you have teammates out there watching your back - unless you been messing around with their wife or girlfriend!
Lastly, you wanna make sure you step back and take cover after you sink that bucket, cos that sky gonna light up like the Fourth of July.
Hey, Luke. I was under a Y-wing, working on the space engine, and the whole thing just dropped on me.
Let's see, I got 10% off a Netflix membership, um... some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar, assorted lotions, and a little plastic champagne bottle full ofjellybeans, and a little bear.
Here's my summary of every Vince Vaughn movie: Oh, I'm incapable of loving another person. Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end.
No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father, who's a pilot, that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country.
Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta gather all these old World War II pilots to help him rescue his father.
That is just what I was going to... His day off... that is just what I was going to say. You know, you are a catch, young lady.
She was in A Beautiful Mind, and I've gotta say, the direction was excellent but I was very disappointed that she, um... wore clothes the entire film.
Yeah, in the way that, like, classy women with expensive clothing who never take the moff are hot, you know?
'cause you definitely worked at it with the clothing, and the jewelry, and the makeup and stuff, but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man... where is the chase and how do I cut to it?
Yeah, yeah, in that sort of you think you could get her, cause she could be your brother kind of thing.
One of those underrated actresses that was always talented and beautiful, and never quite popped, if you know the meaning.
He's a failed writer who just decides that, Ooh, I'm going to have a big last hurrah in Las Vegas.
And then he meets a whore and pays her a bunch of money to stay with him, uh, and have sex with him while he murders himself slowly.
There you are. That's just the kind of can-do spirit that built this nation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.
The runners will score and a cascade of boos rain down from the stands as clearly the fans' sympathy for this scrappy, little no-armed man has run out.
Now, granted the throw was a little wide, but you've got to believe that a two-armed player would've made the catch.
In fact a one-armed player would have at least had a shot at it, which calls to mind the question once again, why, with all the two-armed youngsters waiting in the minor leagues, does this team stick with an arm-less second baseman?
All right, Peter, this is a tough one. All right you ready for this? Okay, would you have sex with Cleveland. if it meant you could have sex with Angelina Jolie.
I'd have to give it to Janet Reno, 'cause I've always had this business plan for a home delivery of prescription medications, and that seems like it's more her market.
I was walking by your house the other day, and, uh, I poked my head in the window and Betty was undressing.
I mean, I knew what to expect after, you know, Joe's accident, and I'm prepared to live the rest of my life this way.
Now, Mr. Swanson, through the magic of digital imaging, we'll select the legs most suited to your body from our inventory of donors.
Well, Peter, I realized over the last few days, the only reason I hung out with you guys is that I was crippled and you were lazy.
Well, Peter, there have been a lot of changes in Joe's life, and maybe he just needed to move on.
Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here in the booth and crack jokes, but you're kind of a buzz kill.
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bar you from the aft section of the ship for the rest of the cruise.
Then I'm gonna make her crawl on her hands and knees while I drip hot candle wax all over her back.
You're gonna bitch and moan, and then you're gonna do what you always do : the minute Lois walks through that door, you're gonna forget all about it, beg for your apple juice, go poop and fall asleep.
All right, so we're driving up to get this abortion and we get to the abortion clinic and the abortionist has one hand.
So I turn to Lois and I says, You want to get an abortion here? You want to get an abortion with the abortionist having a stump hand? We can't get an abortion here.
And finally, still no word on the disappearance of Lois Griffin, housewife and mother from Quahog who vanished from a cruise ship six days ago.
Right after we had that big fight when I said, I wish you were dead, right before I never saw her again.
Either of you guys think it's a little suspicious that Peter took out a life insurance policy on Lois right before she went missing?
I was hoping to keep these mementos, Rupert, but I can't risk it with the dog sniffing around for evidence.
Well, the trail is pretty cold by now, but if Peter did kill Lois, we might find some clues in his garbage.
Can't believe it's been 12 months since I've deliberately choked myself by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges down my throat.
Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid, and I fart at times that ruin my father-in-law's social occasions, and that's why I'm never invited to them.
I mean, not tonight 'cause I've got plans with the guys, but tomorrow night, I want to hear all about it.
I would have been dead if it hadn't been for a passing merman... who treated my wounds and carried me to safety.
It sounds romantic, I know,  but unfortunately, he was kind of a reverse of what you'd expect a merman to be.
After wandering around for a while, I discovered I was in North Carolina where I managed to get a job at a summer camp for fat kids.
Okay, first order of business, uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy, who have agreed to bring cookies for next week's punch social.
Next time they hear 'bout me, they, they's gonna be, like, We was wrong about Stewie, cause I's gonna be huge.
Somebody told me he goes down to Home Depot and pays the migrant workers to go to his house and choke him in the shower.
Once I locate the proper code sequence, this terminal will allow me to take command of the satellites which control the world's power grid.
I now control the entire planet's power grid, and unless you want me to send you all back to the Dark Ages, you'll do exactly as I say.
Look, Hilary, all I know is it's breakfast time, I've got this bowl of Corn Flakes, and I gotta beat work at at 9:00 So what are we going to do here?
Not so fast.Did you know you'd have to eat 17 bowls of those Corn Flakes to get the same nutritional value in one bowl of Total?
Also, as I've had quite enough of the fat man, anyone who sees Peter Griffin must throw apples at him.
And, finally, anyone who uses the terms irregardless, a whole 'nother or all of the sudden shall be sent to a work camp.
Well, you said I didn't have it in me to kill Lois, so I was just running a simulation to find out exactly how killing her and taking over the world would play out for me.
Yes, but theoretically, if someone watched the events of that simulation from start to finish, only to find out that none of it really happened,
Mom, how come, when we see these guys on the street corner, you tell me not to stare a and today that's all we're doing?
You never really feel them love you back, but that's okay because they got other stuff going on, and you understand.
I just had my penis tattooed to look like the space shuttle and my nads tattooed to look like launch exhaust.
All right, guys, it's going to be a long night of border patrol, so I brought along Michael McDonald to help us out.
I think Fuad is an illegal immigrant, and I cannot stand by while he steals wages and opportunities from citizens.
You don't see Nike or Microsoft or General Motors or Ford or Boeing or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's profiting from non-American labor.
Hey, uh, there'sa new policy at work where everyone has to prove they're an American, and I need my birth certificate.
I was so afraid of being judged by the community that I never filled out the paperwork to make you a citizen
I'm gonna get a big, fat piece of pizza so I got something to stuff in my face while I'm reading USA Today.
Peter, I'm using you as a house immigrant, so take my family's luggage to their rooms and then go get settled down at the servants quarters.
We come to America for financial opportunities, Peter, but someday we will return to Mexico because our heritage is rich and glorious.
For example, I used to hate the Japanese, but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips in Young Guns and now I don't hate them anymore.
But men like Carter Pewterschmidt use us for cheap labor, and then-and then try to punish us when we demand to be treated like human beings.
Well, I mean, technically it's yours, but we don't feel like you deserve it, so, we're calling it ours and taking it anyway.
All I have to do is make one call to friend of mine in Washington, and he can push your paperwork through.
Tom, residents all over Quahog have been affected by the heavy rains, although some are doing their best to ride it out.
I like riding the ten-speed because it's fun, it gives me energy, and it's a great way to stay in shape.
This guy may look harmless on the outside, but on the inside he could be a complete bastard, like Fred Flintstone.
You ever sit on your arm till it falls asleep, and then play with yourself and pretend like somebody else is doing it?
All right, Brian, I'm going to go up to the upper level and run this wire down through the wall.
Just don't stop doing it and then chicken out halfway through the pregnancy, because then you'll wind up with Chris.
Oh, and they were all out of the bride and groom figurines, so I got the Iron Giant and a courtroom doll that kids use to show where the molester touched them.
I guess sometimes a father just gets a little over protective of his daughter, but you got to know I was only thinking about your happiness.
I wish I could tell you that the Monopoly guy fought the good fight and the Sisters let him be.
But, mostly,my mustache tells people that there is a 90% chance that I am poorly educated, that I keep upscale pornziou the open and that I listen tothe Little River Band with giant headphones.
There is nothing that'll ever happen in the rest of our lives that's as important as what's going on right here, right now, in high school, by these lockers.
I'm gonna make you somehash browns for breakfast, and then, later, I'm gonna takeyou down to the whoreh to lose your virginity.
You can see them onmy MySpace page, along with my favorite songsand movies and things that other people have created, but that I use toexpress my individualism.
Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it like a parking spacethat you think, Gosh, there's no way I'm gonna be ableto fit in there.
Five minutes.I went in there they injected me with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam good ol'gambling man Peter.
They have a hundred lawyers, and you tried to bribe me with a subscription to Grape Soda Today which I already have.
The McBurgertown franchise suffered a publicity setback today from which it may not recover, thanks to testimony regarding its practices by a very brave cow.
The courage lies with a man who has the guts to say no to a fast food restaurant and eat a salad instead.
I'm going to be honoured with a big ceremony in Martha's Vineyard. they are going to put me up in luxury hotel, all expenses paid.
But he promised he'd go with me to put flowers on my grandmother's grave this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.
Thank you very much. She was grace in name and in essence. To those she loved, she exuded strength, life, laughter and light. And to me, also sorrow. For circumstance had bound her to my best friend, through whom we met in the warmth and serenity of her home. Nothing from the first day I saw her and no one that has happened to me since has ever been as frightening and as confusing. For no person I've ever known has ever done more to make me feel more sure, more insecure, more important and less significant.
You had an opportunity to share a beautiful moment with Brian and you wasted it, wasted it like the Osmond family wastes water.
Almost as potent as the inspiration you give me to plumb the deepest fathoms of my soul for a literary bounty of truth and loveliness.
Thanks. You know, Lois, I'm sure you've already figured this out, but... that essay I wrote- I wrote it about you.
Well,yes. I mean, you and I have a lot in common, and we've spent so much time together over the years, and... of course, that essay you wrote, oh, it really touched my heart.
Well, we may be leaving Martha's Vineyard, but the spirit of this wonderful place will stay in our hearts all the way home.
Agh, Peter,you and your excuses for losing your wallet. I dropped it at the concert. The hooker took it. It's with my other family.
Right, so I got my hand gun and I'm just randomly firing it into a crowd of people and then...
For God's sake, I went to Brown and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
And that's why I contend that when Frost speaks of birch trees, he may very well be talking about himself.
Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I had the same coke supplier, and he threw a punch social one day and we both happened to be there.
Well, our top story continues to be the fall of actor James Woods, who almost overnight has gone from America's most beloved celebrity to America's most hated pariah.

It's like listening to those two foreign guys down at the coffee shop o' bn vi ithU. almost long enough to sound American.
You know, Matthew, I-I may not ever getotr an to say this,so I just want to get this offmy chest.
The truth is I spendat least 90% of my year going away exploringexotic places, having sex with mybeautiful girlfriend,just doing sit-ups.
Money that I made off thteib fmsat I put out into the American populacebecause they just love to see me doing whatit is that I do.
I know. I know. I saidthe same thing. but they're just, like, Oh, we need agood-looking guy with a greaasanso thtbs to just provide some down-home enthusiasmin this picture.
Truth of the mte isI n'li my movies either, but, man, they justkeep offering me money and I do it and I getto go around the world.
So to get out of hereI just make a left out of the driveway and drive as fastas I can?
My mom wanted meto give you this. To Brian from Tracy.He's your obm w. P.S. Will you write mea letter of recommendation for the
I have a pet hedgehog named Zippy and I shall walk her to town, and each time my foot hits the ground, I shall say, Boing, boing, boing. m gi!
Dylan put this paperbaony ad and I could not, for the life of me, figure out howto get it off.
And then in chapter 28 of my novel, the other pilots finally trust the Japanese pilot and let him, let him into... their group.
From now on, I plan on being a real father to Dylan, and together, we are gonna turn his life around.
I am now in possession of hundreds of palettes of crudely painted, not-so-funny plywood cutout folk art, and it's just waiting to transform your uncut, trash-strewn lawn into a living canvas that tells passers-by, Hey, everyone, a real funny bugler lives here.
Your neighbors will chuckle warmly, and motorists will slow down and applaud when they cast their eyes on such favorites as...
Most of this stuff is price to move and until it does, it's an enormous fire hazard, so please, come see me, on Route 2 in Weekapaug.
But that's only because I've truly connected with the one bit of flesh and blood that I have on this earth.
I'll always be grateful to you for turning my life around, but now, thanks to you, I finally have a chance to transform my mom's life in the same way you transformed mine.
We now return to busy business lady, whose life is missing something, but she doesn't realize it, because she's so busy with business.
And you should have sex with that crossing guard, even though she looked young and then i found out she was 12.
After we've had our fill of bread and wine, we shall tell tales of other times we had our fill of bread and wine.
We'll see to it that no child ever received these as a last minute gift hastily bought on the way to the party.
Then a passing nurse accidentally stepped on him and kicked him into a puddle of urin, which must have frightened him, because his bowels released all over himself.
And now all I wanna do is show you my innermost self but I'm afraid you'll reject me, because you won't like what you see.
Or that you'll see my scrotum, and see that it has a seam on it, and then you'll think I'm made up of two different guys that were sewn together,
I went on a date with this girl, that I really like, and, if you don't mind, I was hoping I could ask you a few questions, about the birds and the bees?
Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories, but I was kind of hoping to get some advice from someone who isn't broken from the waist down.
You, a man, are cleaning up a mess made by Anna, a woman, that she, also a woman, spilled on you, a man.
You gotta wait for the beep, you gotta leave your name, you gotta leave your number, wait for the beep!
I know Dad's been trying to help and I'm trying to listen to him but nothing seems to be working.
Well, I know, I asked him to help but it occurs to me that you've been taking advice from everyone except the one person who matters.
You know Carolyn, I rarely find myself connected with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your compagny.
'Course I'll tell you what would really set you right is uh... couple of Aleves and a good night's sleep.
Alright, but just one last piece of advice: Remember, listen to her body, and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you.
Now why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something.
You know it's amazing Cleveland, you went from a black woman to a white woman without having to take a hispanic woman step in between.
That-that's not it at all. I-I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful with her sassy wisdom and speedbag arm fat.
But overall, Loretta is a delightful person, very pleasant to be around, and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
Well we're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good and that he can't trust her and if he catches you guys in the act
What you and I have was a wonderful thing. and as much as I still have a great deal of love for you, our time is over.
Son of a bitch! Looks like I'm gonna have to pile all dinner on top of... He guys how are you!
Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.
I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.
Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.
Say listen Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but there's one person I really want you to meet.
Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.
Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.
Mom, why is it there when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous and when I did, I've got suspended for 5 days.
I raised River Phoenix from the dead then we went out to the Viper Room and he OD'd again. blah-blah-blah
Boy. Who would've thought, me, Peter Griffin, the guy you just two weeks ago drew a smily face on his own testicle to make his son laugh.
This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!
That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.
Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconscious.
Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying: Jews are responsible for all the world's wars
Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.
And when I've got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out.
There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo, and my great aunt Vera, who didn't like to spend a lot on anything.
Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top jew.
No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe from the nazis.
Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful and rub dirt my assneck(?) all over my assy nipples.
We pray in the name of you and of your son, who died in a freak accident, that you can't really blame on anyone.
So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home.
Yeah, but you remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one and then rescues them at the end of the third one?
All right guys, the best thing you can do for your body after a massage is hot coffee, alcohol and slim jims.
Why is it every time I open this door you seem to be in some ridiculous vehicle you inexplicibly acquired?
Plus I've had a lot of time to rub one out which in space is great, except after a while it's like living in a snow globe.
So, if you're cruising along the left side of the road at a 120 km per hour in zis kheavy desert, turn up the decibels
I'm gonna take Brians novel and replace every use of the word and with the word fart. The young soldier fart his brother looked at each other fart both knew that with love fart truth fart courage they would both emerge st-fart-ing on their feet.
No. Peter, Iraq had nothing to do with this, it was bunch of Saudi-Arabians, Lebanese and Egyptians financed by a Saudi-Arabian guy living in Afghanistan and sheltered by Pakistanis.
Of course how hard could it be? You just unfasten these things and lay back with your legs in the air and let nature do the rest.
Our baby is at home all by himself yet instead of getting us home you've managed to make things worse at every turn!
I promise with all my heart that I'll never say or do anything bad to you for the rest of the evening.
You know, Peter, I'd expect this kind of behaviour from you but you have no business endangering Brian like that.
He's old, Peter. Plus he drinks and smokes all the time so take that 56 and make it 79 at least.
Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while, so I've got you a journal.
Dear diary. Today at the school library I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman with nipples that cover most of her breast too.
Well, you know, I wasn't sure about this new dog thing at first but I've gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy.
Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of-- ran my course here and you know, besides there's whole big world out there and it's time I saw it.
I'm gonna be bringing a puerto-rican girl over here later and she's superhot and real nice but when she was five years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van and it's still kinda messed up in a pretty obvious instantly visible way and uh-- please don't say anything and-- try to make eye contact with her when she waddles in because I want this to work.
I mean she herself is so pretty but-- that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in 'em.

And sometimes walking out on to a dry plane or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then.
No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights, and we especially don't like the way you humped that chair in the den.

Oh, Lois, I've just had a weirdest dream that Louis Black told jokes that was so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear.
He was the only guy on the golf course who had a five iron with the cork on the end of it.
I like to bring transient hookers to the old oak-tree where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I watch them having sex with each other.
Hey, come on, we had a great seventy-two hour run and in this business that's all you can ask for.

Guys, I don't think I can make it today. It looks like Bonny might go in to labor any minute so I think I should stick close to home.
Man, I am so sick of this. Joe is just gonna keep bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonny's butt.
What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.
I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.

Brian comes in and it changes the song looking at me like he thinks I'm a douchebag but he's gonna learn pretty fast that he's wrong hey Brian, why are you bringing me down there? why are you bringing me down? DON'T BRING ME DOWN!
All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.
But you know, dad will find out he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.

Dear god! I could describe the horror I'm witnessing but it is so unfathomable ugly and heartrending that I cannot bring myself to do so.
I know you can't hear any screams but I assure you they're signing frantically just as fast as their little fingers can shape the complicated phonemes necessary to convey dread and terror.
Oh boy. I miss the old days when it was just a flaming bag of poop and a hurtful note.
All right, mr. Griffin, at this time we're going to inject you with what we believe we've isolatet as... the Gay gene.
I assume that's the one you meant even though it wasn't literally the last thing I've said when you said What did you just say?
I think I'm jelous of miss Eats anything she wants and still fits into size 4 Oh, I could scratch your eyes out. Meow.
So we're all just gonna have to get used to this and lend to accept your father for who he is now.
No, thanks, Rick. Ever since Peter left our house hasn't been getting destroyed by a shenenigans on a weekly basis.
You're all here because you've made a choice to renounce your evil sinful ways and redeem yourself in the eyes of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ who hates many people but none more than homosexuals.
Oh god, I feel like I'm kid in the candy store who's having sex with a bunch of gay guys.
Tonight's episode of Family Guy was recently discovered in Peter Griffin's basement, along with a number of other lost episodes.
Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?
So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.
And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf away from all those people who have demonized me and made me out some kind of bogeyman.
That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson as a boy and you just can't accept the fact that he's not who you thought he was.
Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.
Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise on how to murder a woman and get away with it.
We don't have footage of the murder itself but we can show you what's happened thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.
I love you, Nicole but I must confess to some trepidation for I am a lonely waiter who loves a loss of a estation (?) opera-style song
Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.
This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.
W-w-well ... y'know I came down here not even thinking I had a shot and now you're telling me this?
Lois, I can't believe you're doing this. If you work for FOX News you're  going to be selling your soul.
This is our control room, where we have the ability to monitor up to 500 different news stories in any given hour.
Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose are trying to build a house of cards and it keeps falling down?
Umm ... maybe Poopy Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh .. Boy, this house of cards just doesn't wanna stay up.
Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna go right at it like a neanderthal sure, but I think we're shooting for a little more subtilty here, y'know.
Y'know, I don't believe that. I don't believe that that's a real conversation when I hear it. People don't talk like that, Meg.
Oooh ...oooh! What if they just bought a new wood stove and Red Hynie Monkey says, Boy, it's so hot in here because we just bought that new wood stove
(Both) and we're sweating, and our hands are all slippery and that's why we can't get the card house to stay up.
I mean, we haven't even referenced the fact that they're ducks or that they're handicapped. But the show is called Handi-Quacks.
Alright, Lois, for your first assignment we want you to do an investigative expose on one of America's greatest enemies.
We have reason to suspect that Michael Moore may be a closet homosexual. We need you to get the proof.
Well, if you think that Michael Moore's possible homosexuality is news worthy, I'll do my best to get the story.
People will tune in to Handi-Quacks each week and see that big red bum and get a big laugh out of it.
Good note. Good note. OK, now I also had a thought for a female character who's always nagging at Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not to leave his beer cans lying around and what-not.
What are you talking about? You're the one who sent me to investigate, and now I'm showing you proof and you're dismissing it?
You understand? I. am. Colonel. Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon so. I. talk. like. this. with. a. moon. accent. Do that!
Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They wanted you to do the story when they thought it would embarrass Michael Moore, but they don't want you to do it if it's going to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
You realise that the only reason I'm taking this meeting is that your wife is a reporter for our news division?
We take you on a little trolley ride down story lane. You're havin' a good time, enjoying out little tale, think you know what's coming. BOOM!
You're yukking it up, you're laughing, your sides are hurting. All of a sudden you realise, you're feeling something too.
Well, after the Wonder Years I was hungry to do more acting but the pickings were slim so I came up with this scheme to satisfy my need to perform and I guess it got a little out of hand.
Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight
Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says: I am in command. You are safe with me.
I have this itch on the back of my leg. And I can't figure out if it's a bug bite or dry skin?
Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but your father's bringing in the old TV.  Hey Meg!
Here's your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote and it only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.
If my calculations are correct the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation will soon be here to anwser all my questions!
You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have faith in but there is such a thing as moderation.
And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.
I try to rent a movie and they threw me out. I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they threw me out.
I know, I know. Hey, you mind spreading the news around town, say maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam
If there were a God would he put you here on Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?
And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.
You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with.
Hey, lets take a man- sized poop in his cat box so he thinks there's something really wrong with him.
How 'bout we hide the cat's body and leave that window open and that way, it'll seem like the cat ran away.
No, no. Pot is illegal because William Randolph Hearst ran a smear campaign against marijuana in the 1930's to protect his interests in the timber industry because hemp was poised to replace wood as an inexpensive raw material for the manufacture of paper.
Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test and if I give him some of mine he's gonna know I've been smoking pot so I need some of your urine so I can ...
No, what's sick is making marijuana illegal when it's been proven that it does less damage to you than alcohol.
Brian, when you have to go to these lengths just to get away with smoking pot it's time to make a change.
Look Lois, ever since marijuana was legalized   crime has gone down, productivity is up, and ratings forl Dr. Who are through the roof.
Y'know, I've only seen that show once but I gotta tell ya,  what's really weird to me is why is the voice of the guy from the future, Bob Saget?
Marijuana's illegal because of you, and Stewie got to build a nice little fort with all of your unsold books.
I want you to know I'm raising my reward to 50 dollars for anyone who can help me find James.
What was weird, was that she was crying   but the way she was standing over me, made it look like I was crying.
Uh, so, I heard you talking in the hall the other day about how much you liked High School Musical 2, so I burned you the soundtrack.
Well, I took him to the gym and the colorful gent there advised me that I put him on steroids.
Well, to answer your question, Connie, apparently I'm married to a man who thinks it's OK to inject an infant with steroids.
I do this for you, and I have your permission to think about you later tonight when I'm in the tub.
The meeting of the Cool Kids Club will be at 3:15 leaning up against Tim Breckner's SUV in the parking lot.
Brian, I'm filling out my RSVP card ... and I don't know whether I should get the salmon or the snausages.
Shutup! He's obviously some sort of Superman. I just   I just need to know if he has any shortcomings that'll make me feel better.
No, no .. it's just .. I .. I mean .. I probably had a lot to drink last night so if I did anything that might have offended you, I'm .. I'm sorry.
Hey, you know what? I'm actually on my way to go shoot now if you want, you guys can tag along.
Whatta ya want? I came out to Hollywood, I'm on camera all day and I turned my back on my own kind.
I need to be, like, fine, to be alone, and, like, not even want to date someone and then I know I'll be fine to get into a relationship.
It's OK. They fill the rest with shots of street signs, and fronts of restaurants and old footage from the A Team.
Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I got a little wrecked after dinner and I didn't wanna drive home.
Well, I think it's wonderful that  you're datin' such a classy, well educated girl like Lauren Conra ... ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.
It was a one night thing. I have no interest in dating one of those shallow idiot celebrities who's only famous for being famous.
We're even using state of the art computer animation to create a fake sex tape with me and Bill Cosby.
Now, you will get ready for the zim zam and the babbidy bibbedy. and you will take off your clothes, like vooo and voooom and get ready for the most splendiferous pudding pop you have ever seen.
Lauren just finished a fascinating doctoral thesis on sub-orbital propulsion mechanisms that NASA is using for the next generation of space shuttles.
Well, Halsey was hospitalized with cirrhosis at the outset of the battle so Spruance, who prior to June of 1941, was primarily a desk Admiral was charged with leading the naval fleet at Midway against Japan.
That's it. I mean, I don't know what else I can do. The wedding's tomorrow and she hasn't shown any signs of leaving Derek.
I want you .. no .. I need you with all my heart and soul. And my only regret is that I didn't realize it when we were together.
So I went to the library and picked up three books by the greatest author of the last thousand years.
We begin with a little tale called Stand by Me about 4 young boys who went looking for a dead body and instead found ..... themselves. ... and also a dead body.
Anything was possible as we set out that day except contracting AIDS because AIDS had not yet been invented by the government in an effort to eradicate the homosexual community.
Even though legend had it, that any kid caught scaling the fence ran the risk of being attacked by the old man's dog. who would charge to the cry of Chopper, sick balls
Now, he said sic 'em, boy, but what I heard was Chopper, talk to disfigured World War 2 veterans who aren't as bitter as they should be.
The twisted and mangled body we had come to see was far more disgusting than any of us could ever have imagined.
Joey learned to live without the use of his legs, and even went on to create a wheelchair type rugby game called Don't-feel-sorry-for-us-ball
Um, Paul, quick question, and feel free to say no, but I couldn't help but notice the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript in your bag, and, I was wondering if I could read it then kill you if I hate it?
Look, Stewie, I've gone as far as I can with Snuggly Jeff, and I .. I wanna write something more serious
But then this other guy's like: Hey, it just so happens, I built another identical trillion dollar space machine at my own expense, on the other side of the world
Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said: No! You can't go into space because the machine already got blown up by Jake Cock-a-Doody Busey!
If I let you go, you'll just run straight to the police and tell them I kidnapped you and held you hostage and fondled you while you were asleep.
Now, you remember that Stephen King story when the guy went up to the empty hotel and there were those creepy twins and a guy was runnin' around with that axe and a kid talked to his finger?
He was a fat drink of water, the kind of drink of water that y'know your friend got from the bathroom and not from the kitchen. fat one breaks first tonight.
But I have to imagine it's a foul disease ridden thing that wears too much makeup to cover up the fact that it's a 47 year old fish dog.
A prison is an environment which requires the highest level of discipline ... and that little stunt you pulled today
Up in a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, under an old oak tree, there's a rock that has no earthly business bein' there.
What the warden and his boys didn't realise was that Andy Dufresne had escaped from Shawshank Prison the night before.
It's just a stupid made up word so boys like you can sit behind a desk, wear a fancy suit, and feel important.
I dunno, but I ordered him a beer and now it's just sittin' there lookin' lonlier than Alan Rickman's answering machine.
Hello, Alan Rickman. It's Alan Rickman reminding you to move the pork chops from the freezer to the refigerator so they defrost properly.
Now wait a second, Cool Runnings. We learned in school that Miles Chatterbox Musket founded Quahog, after he was saved by the magic clam.
Peterson, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be down at your job, making oblong bricks out of manure and straw?
I was just walkin' off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.
What a wonderfully exciting day. I'm young, I'm all dressed up, and I'm on my way to marry the woman I love.
Well, at least it wasn't one of those promos where they've got the whole cast shoving each other playfully,  like they're all good pals.
Oh, I know. I've just been so tired, and I've had so much work, and I think .. I think I wanted to the other day but I couldn't find you. So, y'know, it's like both of  us on our schedules, y'know?
Griffin Peterson and the other colonists worked day and night to build their new settlement, until finally, after much hard work, the colony of Quahog was complete.
I was ordered to keep silent by the King, under threat of execution but .. you're gonna see this anyway.
.. and then I finished scrubbing the kettle but .. then I saw that I'd missed a spot and, oh .. I was so worried that the whole thing wasn't clean enough so I went back and started washing it again, and sure enough ...
Well, I mean, sometimes we .. we..  we sleep .. we.. we go to different .. er, we go to bed at.. at different times. We've both been so busy ... it's been .. rediculous! I .. I thought she was takin' a class or something.
Months rolled by, and Griffin and Lady Redbush continued to flourish happily in the colony of Quahog, completely unaware that King Stewart was on the march.
Little wrong in the head, I am, from eatin' some bad sausages. Yes, bad sausages that I eat, indeed, sir.
All those months I was without you, I never stopped seein' your face in the back of my wife's head.
Alright, your Majesty. If you wanna leave with your pal in one piece, I suggest you throw down your weapons.
Hear ye! Hear ye! This talent competition will decide rightful possession of the good Lady Redbush and control of the colony of Quahog.
I know I been able to keep this a secret.   But Kathy and I are not actually working on a project together. We're... in love
Now kids, you don't have to  call her mom right away, but I do want you guys to get along.
Oh, Lois, I've missed you! You and your wonderful smile and your beautiful eyes and your awesome third boob that's on top of the other boob.
Now Mrs. Griffin, although you are in the clear for the moment, we need to have a look at your family medical history to determine your future risk.
Look, Peter, I am the one  with the Jewish heritage, and I really don't want to make a big deal out of this.
As we approach the passover holiday, let us remember the struggle of our people as they labored under the yoke of Pharaoh's despotic rule.
Yeah I have a question. What are you gonna do when Jesus comes back and puts a boot up your ass?
Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose. Don't even try and make him lose, because it's just gonna be that much more embarrassing for you
This is my first time doing a Seder which is where we tell the story of the Jews escaped from bondage in Egypt
And discover his identity is by saying the phrase, gosh, that italian family at the next table sure is quiet.
I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer to think of it as a happy accident. Is she ready ?
Come to think of it, how did this get in my wallet in the first place ? Dear Brian, somewhere between the point when you're excited enough to want it and too excited to care, think about your future.
First of all, that's not true, and second of all, she's not like that. She's wonderful, she's smart, she's pretty.
The only reason I haven't brought her around is that you guys don't always make the best impression with girls I date.
We've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after their release, and even corresponded with them in prison.
Okay, you know what ? I'll bring her to dinner, and you can see for yourself what a bright, fun, and charming woman she is.
You know what we haven't done for a while ? Go around the table, and everybody says what year they were born.
Boy, speaking of that, I don't know how many people have asked me today where I was when Martin Luther King was shot.
Nobody bats an eye if a woman dates an older man, but god forbid it's the other way around !
So, what are you doing this afternoon ? Oh, I'm just sorting out my pills for the week, sweetie. well, you do that, and I'll be over a little later.
Listen, Brian, you say the word and I'll go in there with a pillow and you won't have any more problems.
You see, these past few weeks I've been doubting whether we're compatible, you know, because of the age difference. But I realized that that doesn't matter.
That what-what I get from you is what I always wanted : a smart, sexy, real person who I can talk with and share every piece of me with.
I had a moment of weakness today, but in a way, it's all right because it's taken me to a place where I now realize that you're not too old for me.
You can rationalize it any way you want, but to me, all that shows is that you're an immature guy who doesn't realize what a catch I am.
So far the only station that comes in is some british guys reading news from places I'm not sure exist.
Today, in Kuzikistan, a peaceful demonstration turned to bloodshed as members of the turzirly tribe flooded Kenpao square in remembrance of the third anniversary of the Hormsburg massacre.
But finally, some good news out of neighboring Kanduzi, as locals there have reached an uneasy alliance with the bordering Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal.
You know, dad, I saw that movie White Noise, and they said you can use empty radio static to talk to dead people.
My schedule's been so packed. I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass stuff.
We had a little bit of a problem earlier because bitch Stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he ?
Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail and run your fingers along the length of your tail.
Squeeze the base of the tail lightly with your thumb and index finger and then, while continuing to squeeze, run them up the length of your tail to the tip and I'll make you a clone.
It's true. I never mentioned this because I don't want him to feel bad, but after he was born, they had to rearrange most of my organs.
Okay, now I want to qualify this by reminding you, as with my clone, the intelligence level is reduced a bit.
So, it's just not working out, me being a father and that's why I'm wondering if you and Lois would be willing to adopt the baby.

She's fascinated by things that are going in my life, and... Fine, I googled myself, okay ? You got me. But check this out.
I am sick as hell of you constantly making a mess of this house and having to clean up after you.
Why don't you shut your *** mouth for once and go home *** *** and your wife in the face !
Well, I've killed seven, but the point is, you might feel better if you just confess to what you've done.
I know, and that's why I'm prepared for you to arrest me and take me to jail where I belong.
I just couldn't take the stress anymore. I had to come clean. I mean, the truth is, I didn't even stop to find out if he had an owner. I just completely...
If I ever get molested or raped, this is the place I'm gonna think of to make everything all right.
I just can't believe our society actually values the life of a dog less than that of a human. It's infuriating.
Look at that dog over there. You think he wants to be tied to that chair, waiting in the hot sun while his owner gets ice cream ?
Hell, no ! I am gonna make people see that an animal's life is just as important as a human's !
Our first meeting is tomorrow night, and I'd really appreciate it if you guys would come and show your support.
Somebody better have something to say to me pretty damn soon, or I'm gonna have something to say to them !
I couldn't agree more. Just let me see if Mikey sells those things with batteries or what the situation is there.
Now underneath each one of your chairs you'll find a pamphlet with a simple list of animal rights do's and don't's.
Wait a second. Just to prove a point to me, you burned down a liquor store and murdered a dog ?!
Hi, we here at Family Guy want you to know that we respect all living beings and assure you that no animals were harmed in the making of this episode.

Hi, we here at Family Guy want you to know that we respect all living beings and assure you that no animals were harmed in the making of this episode.
Eaten by sharks while snorkeling Stabbed to death in a toys r us bathroom. ...1940s roller skate left in the hall.

How would you like to take a half pound of hamburger and make a delicious meal for the whole family...
He's never gonna be quite in step with the rest of us and this is sort of my way of taking care of him.
Well, that's nice of you, but it was so much simpler when it was just you and me doing our thing.
What if he's in a coma for, like, 20 years and he comes out of the coma and you guys are all dead.
But I'm still alive and I'm a famous race car driver, and he's like aw, man, Stewie turned out awesome.
If you're watching this one it means the train wasn't able to push the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour and I'm still stuck in 1885.
Pewterschmidt Industrie's pharmaceutical division is up over 30%, profits in new media have doubled each quarter over the past year and our stock is at an all-time high.
I'm gonna toss a ball to one of you, and whoever catches it, throw out the first idea you got then pass the ball to the next guy. He throws out an idea and so on.
You've been treating me like crap For 20 years, Mr. Pewterschmidt, and now I'm the one in charge. Hang on a second.
Hi. I was gonna catch the big bang theory tonight and wondered if you wanted to come over and watch.
And then he made me clean out the fridge in the employee lounge, and the employees were mad at me because I threw out food that they still wanted.
And if you don't mind, I'll address you in my natural speaking voice, as I've grown so weary of doing an american accent.
So I'm gonna go with the flute that Captain Picard played, first in his imagination and then in real life, in the episode
Oh, my God, we gotta watch this. Look what they're saying about it. As funny as it is touching !, Gene Shalit. I stood up and cheered. Go, Julia, go !, Joel Siegel. This movie made me laugh so hard I had mild headaches.
Well, we usually come here, you buy us drinks and tell us what Lois's nipples look like, like you always do.
And if sex with the rest of you is half as good as it was with her, then I think we're all gonna get along just fine.
Your father doesn't remember his life, and he doesn't want us to be a part of it, so we've just got to move on.
Well, I'm a bachelor, so I invited a bunch of people over, and now I'm waiting for them to leave. That's what bachelors do.
I almost don't want to ask you out because I know you're gonna say no. You want to go out ? No ? Okay.
Gosh, you know, I was just picking up a couple hams to take down to the shelter and here I run into you, buying food to make dinner for your husband.
All right, Peter, now I know your head is still a blank slate, but you got to listen to me when I say... Wait.
Look, fella, I don't know who you are and I don't want to, so why don't you just go back to your crabgrass ?
But if Peter's never coming back to me, it's at least nice to know I'm in the arms of a trusted friend.

In anticipation of this event, we put together a clip package featuring some of billy's work for channel 5 News. I'm still hungry. said the very hungry caterpillar. But you've already...
And if that don't convince you, look at this. In this week's TV guide, it says, Peter gets more than he bargained for when he joins the rodeo.
Well, he robbed his way from Utah to Oklahoma and the law just could not seem to track him down and it served his legend well for the folks, they loved to tell about when billy the kid came to town.
You know, just because you're writing a profile on teenage girls, it doesn't mean you have to be a creepy stalker and follow Meg around all day.
Sunday, Sunday... Here it is. Peter gets more than he bargains for When he joins the rodeo. Boy, did I. And Meg dates a prison escapee !
I forgot to tell you how much I like the rearrangement you and bonnie did with your living room furniture.
Already ? It seems like just yesterday we rented her room to that fly that wants to leave, but can't figure it out.
She's probably a little fragile after being in there so long, and I'm sure she'll be heartened to see our faces.
I'm a woman in a lab coat wearing goggles, staring intently at a beaker that I'm holding near my face.
This isn't a library, you know. And in the face of every adolescent challenge, she looks at the world through hopeful eyes and maintains an uncommon resilience that can only be admired. In this sense, Meg Griffin is not the typical american girl. She is far sweeter and kinder than that.
I was just so tired of being everyone's whipping girl that it felt kind of good to do some of the whipping.

I came to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.
So you know, you got only yourself to blame next time you go to the vet sand complain that that Indian doctor is too rough with your cat.
Our top story : The search for two local boys lost in the woods drags on into its third day.
We're still very optimistic that we're gonna find these kids, and we just want to urge everyone not to give up hope.
You know, Mom, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about psychics who help find people who are lost.
I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel about this fat woman who sat on her dog and it went up inside her guts.
Gentlemen, these are all important fundamental rights, but I move we strike the right to bob for small fish with your butt in the air.
Because, if the circumstances were such, as you have described them, but with me in them, that's a very different and scary outcome for those involved.
Because, Meg, Estelle told me that someone in the family was in danger of drowning, and that I should take some steps to prevent it.
All right, look, Lois, this psychic nonsense has gone too far, so I'm going to prove to you that there is no such thing as someone who is psychic, and that with the most minimal training and the right set of buzzwords, anyone can appear to be psychic.
Just by asking very general questions that would apply to most people, a person can appear to have inside knowledge about you.
You know, I used to hear that people with down's syndrome were different than the rest of us, but you're not.
No, you didn't. You made a vow that you were going to ask Ellen out, and you did. That took courage, my friend.
Okay, Joe, when I'm tracking someone, it often helps to touch something that belongs to the victim. Does he have a wife ?
Okay. Like a... like a young 12 or, like, a she eats a lot of milk products so she got her boobs early 12 ? Which is a real thing, by the way.

I was, like, is he gonna fall for this And then when you did, I was like, I guess I should see how far I can take it 'cause you know, it'll be funnier.
You know, we've enjoyed having you around so much lately, so we got a little welcome to the family present for you.
I mean, I need all the help I can get, but you have such a youthful look, you could pass for 11 months.
Gotta hide it for the cameras. Instead of tucking it, I just push it in like a button and put a band-aid over it.
She told me, it was the christmas we all went to Edaville Railroad, and you cried because you were afraid because one of Santa's elves was a real midget, and father said, that's it, I can't take this anymore, and he left that very night and all you cared about was ice cream on the way home and mother said you didn't appreciate anything !
At least I didn't bring up that time at Brigham's when you showed your fanny to that girl in the wheelchair !
You've made me feel so unattractive lately that I went and did something disgusting and abhorrent and I'm ashamed of myself.
I guess I thought that if I could bring you down, you wouldn't start to notice that you're too good for me and run off looking for another fella.
I moved here because my uncle was molesting my sister, and my parents wanted her to start a new life.
But my sister Mary shot herself in the face, and that's when I decided that she would live on through me.

This is my rassinfrackin' land, and I don't care what no man from no Tennessee valley authority says, consarnit !
Look, I'm sorry, I can't help you. what? You too big and famous to walk over to that corner drugstore and pick up a pen and paper and possibly some other groceries I need and come back and sign several things for me ?
From now on I'm gonna be right where the action is, like my uncle the guy in the white hat Griffin.
My chemistry teacher, Mr Taylor, rubbed my shoulders for 35 minutes in class the one day I didn't wear a bra.
to come in here and give you a good shoe to the gift bag. You know, keep you in line.
It means standing up to fart, not hidin' it in a pillow or holdin' it in till your stomach goes...
Because I vowed to myself that I would spend the last night of my life in the company of the most beautiful woman in the world.
If we can get just one good shot at it, we can blow that fat bastard out of the cosmos.
It's basically Jaws, except when the guys in the boat are going after Jaws, they look around and there's an even bigger Jaws, so the guys have to team up with Jaws to get bigger Jaws.
But after spending the last 18 hours on the Internet and in libraries trying to find traces of it somewhere,
Look, I don't want to get your hopes up, but Daddy's got some connections over at CBS, and I think he could help you get this on TV.
I mean, Byron is a 25-year-old single father going back to finish college so he can do right by his four-year-old daughter.
So it's got to be somebody who can project a certain amount of world-wizened sophistication, while at the same time retaining a certain youthfully passionate idealism.
You know, Brian, you've spun gold into these pages, and it's our job to bring that gold to the screen.
Now, this is the scene where Byron's professor fails him for missing the chemistry midterm to take his daughter to the doctor.
We should have told somebody, but we were too scared, and-and-and I wanted to take him to the hospital, but Chris wouldn't let me.
I wrote a script that really meant a lot to me, and you guys took it and turned it into something cheap and ridiculous.
Let's put a hat on him to cover the wound, and-and then let's get some makeup and draw eyeballs on his eyelids and find a way to pin this on someone else.
Our top story tonight, scientists at NASA have made a fascinating new discovery: the first directly observable instance of a black hole, which appears to be located just outside our solar system.
Tom, I'm standing here with Stephen Hawking, the first white man I've ever met who knows math better than me.
I am part of an elite group of individuals deemed intelligent enough to decide the fate of a fellow citizen.
The only reason you've never been called is that they use the voter registration list, and this past election is the first time you ever voted.
All right, now the prosecution is about to show you items pertinent to this case that have been entered into evidence.
I would like to remind members of the jury that you are forbidden to discuss details of the case outside the courtroom.
NASA has made the alarming announcement that the newly discovered black hole at the edge of our solar system appears to be expanding.
Seems like I've run out of waiting time. ...but it looks like Nicole Ritchie's baby is gonna be just fine.
Also in the news, the doomsday clock is ticking with less than 19 hours to go before our planet is consumed by an expanding black hole.
Well, it's become clear, the only way to avert this disaster is by writing a strongly-worded letter to the black hole. Dear space. Well, you're just full of surprises, aren't you? You think you're so good 'cause you went to Choate. Well, you're not gonna be so tough when I put a fish bowl on my head and a rocket pack on my back and come up there and punch you.
Well, Diane, now that our time is almost up, just to lighten the mood, we introduce a new feature called Tom's Crank Calls.
I want you kids to know how much your father and I love you and how important this family is to us.
You know, I went to the zoo last week and asked if I could do it, and they told me to scram.
It was real, good old-fashioned grab the nearest tree and hold on for dear life gay, not today's fancy, featherbed, thread-count gay.
The only thing that's nice about this is even though it's a Tuesday, it feels kinda like it's a Friday.
We here at Channel Five would like to leave you with some highlights of mankind's brief existence, like the Battle of Hastings.
We at Channel Five News concocted the whole black hole story as part of our commitment to being festive around the holidays.
I know, and I love 'em, but don't you just sometimes wish they'd run away or get kidnapped and be made to work in a Temple of Doom?
Trapjaw is trying to get a variance to build an unpermitted structure within ten feet of Optimus Prime's property line.
Destro is the City Councilman who's telling Trapjaw that he has to file it as an accessory structure, and even then it can only be built at the rear of the lot.
Look, I know you kids ain't too happy with your dad right now, but I hope at least you could see that I'm tryin'.
Dad, can we please have a turn at the Xbox? uh, now, which one do I press to shoot now?
Good evening, America. Tonight we present a full hour of Family Guy, beginning with a very special extended episode, followed by some never-before-seen musical clips.
You know, it's the one time I ever splurged on myself, and you have to go and make me feel foolish.
Can't believe this. We're locked in here until tomorrow and the only thing I've eaten today was a grape Chris dropped at breakfast.
So what I would need you to do is eat what's in my diaper, lick the diaper clean, possibly lick my fanny and then put the diaper back on me.
You stink! And now I'm trapped in here with you and your stink because you were too stupid to call somebody who could help us!
Oh, and just do me a favor and tell me when you're about to begin because I don't wanna be surpri...  Moon river!
First you have to say that you'll do it before I tell you, no mat... no matter what it is.
I don't give a... I'm all worked up right now, so we have to do it. Just do it, okay?
You know, I don't, I don't know why I told Matthew that I liked, that I liked The Bounty Hunter
Well, I could save you the embarrassment and shoot you in the head except there aren't any bullets in this gun.
A bowl that starts in the kitchen at the beginning of a meal and ends up in the living room. Shut up.
Oh, good, 'cause that'd be strange if you had fantasies about pressing a gun up against your crotch and feeling your heartbeat through your balls.
Dogs are supposed to be able to instinctively live with purpose, not even to have think about it, just born like that.
And, you know, I'm not talking about purpose in the shallow, Rick Warren over-the-counter self-help variety because that's... that's just delusion.
I mean, is there ever a time when we're truly in the present moment and not looking toward the past or the future?
I mean, not in like a Hey, let's, you know, let's have an underpants party, or whatever grownups do when they're in love, but I mean,
Okay, go. Chapter One: I am born. Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station shall be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life,
And for the rest of the hour, we'd like to treat you to some of your favorite Family Guy musical moments.
Peter and his friends from the National Association for the Advancement of Fat People never got to mourn for any of the victims.
One thing we like to do at Family Guy is make fun of pop culture by twisting it and mocking it and commenting on it.
A Jerry Lewis film entitled The Errand Boy that was created for the episode where Peter takes over Pewterschmidt Industries.
Several years back, Brian made friends with an elderly woman who had been homebound for years, and he attempted to bring her out of her shell.
We became close friends, and I sang this song to explain to her all the wonderful things that she was missing by shutting herself off from society.
Quahog is a wonderful example of suburban America-- full of neighbors who look out for each other and enjoy spending time together.
Up next, we find Peter and Lois in need of a babysitter, and their kind, elderly neighbor, Herbert, offers to help out.
And now we have a super special treat: a never-before-aired clip that may be the greatest thing we've ever done.
True, but when Peter found out that his father wasn't Francis, the man who raised him, but instead a man in Ireland, Peter decided to visit.
The breeze was just warm enough that you could wear short sleeves, but you know, not so warm that you break any kind of a sweat. because let me tell you, I do hate to perspire. It just ruins...
And a lot of little things: the way he talks, his mannerisms, and he had the complete DVD set of Sex and the City between his butt cheeks.
I guess I could, but I don't know if it'll do any good, Lois; he's in complete denial, like people in massive debt.
My dad wanted me to tell you he would be thrilled if you and Lois would join us as his guest at the naval ball.
At the navy ball, you'll see how much of a man he is and how everyone in the military respects him.
He has an appointment Friday with Dr. Hartman to have the procedure, and he wants me to go with him.
We should put on some '80s music, and then, like, every few minutes, have him come out of there as a different sex, and we'll go...
Not to worry, I called in, and a new cell phone should be here for you in three business days.
I didn't know what to do, so I took them off and hummed them at the wall, and they started sliding down like one of them sticky octopuses.
But when their trail had led to a bartender in Virginia, they had given up, much the way the world had given up on them.
Besides, this will be way more fun than hanging out in Maine with the wives, sitting around a campfire, listening to Lois tell grocery stories. Oh, Peter, you should have been there. Uncle Ben's converted brown rice was on sale.
But then Daddy got frustrated 'cause he couldn't find it, so we just ate fast food in the parking lot.
Donna's been nice enough to invite us to stay the weekend, and frankly, that sounds better than continuing this wild-goose chase.
All right, well, if you have a sudden change of heart and you want to chase us down the street as we're pulling away, you know where to find us.
One of us should pretend we're hurt, and when the guards come in to give him medical attention, we'll jump 'em!
See, the March of Dimes wanted this air time to talk about cancer kids or somethin', but I was like, No way! Monkey scratch!

Okay, great. Annoying question. We have to get gas, would you mind pulling off and waiting for us while we do that?
I'm asking, did you see the DVD frat house edition with all the uncensored footage and the interview with Ryan Reynolds?
I'm glad you're here. Look, I pulled this all apart, and it looks like you're gonna need a new condenser.
Okay, well, how about this? Do you want me to just go ahead and do that while I'm replacing the new condenser?
You know, I'm up for this, but it kind of feels like the dark side has a better gym than us.
Correct. I also would've accepted the rotting old woman in The Shining, but Kathy Bates is probably worse. Best scene in Teen Wolf?
When Michael J. Fox is in the bathroom, turning into a werewolf for the first time and his dad's knocking on the door and he is freaking out and he opens the door and his dad's a werewolf, too.
I would've also accepted the scene at the end, at the basketball game, where the guy in the crowd has his dick out.
Go online. Look it up. He's in the stands, way in the background, and he's totally got his dick out.
All right, Luke's on Dagobah, there's a Rebel base on Kashyyyk, and I'm the one who clogged the toilet on the 16th floor.
And as long as we're freezing things, why don't you toss this ice cube tray full of orange juice in there?
Nice work, fellas! And, David, you sold the most magazine subscriptions, so you get to invite four of your friends to a pizza party.
You know? I mean, it doesn't have to be as father and son, it can just be as, you know, as two really close guys who just happen to be men, you know?
I mean, it's not even about the doing it part, but that's a part of it, but it's not the whole thing.
A letter. Dear Luke, if my calculations are correct, you should receive this letter at the exact moment the DeLorean vanished. I have been living happily for the past six months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that...
I don't know that. I haven't seen that show in a while and I don't know that anyone else has.
All right, Peter, I don't know what this is about, but you're my best friend and I'd like to think that you do the same for me.
Look, I know it's an inconvenience, but it's a wonderful gift to be able to give someone, so I am going through with it.
Lois, I don't want you walking around all pregnant for nine months, just to hand over that thing when it comes out like a hen to a farmer.
But Lois, if they do it good enough, they'll save the rec center from being torn down and replaced by some mall.
Lois, do I need to do anything tomorrow that doesn't involve me being bent over in excruciating pain three feet from a toilet?
But before you do, remember: science has proven that within hours of conception a human fetus has started a college fund and has already made your first Mother's Day card out of macaroni and glitter.
And did you know the baby you aborting may also have a baby inside of it that you're also aborting?
What if you look at the ultrasound and see that the baby is gonna be born with no arms and no legs?
We got invited to a party. Peter Griffin, you and your family are cordially invited to a gala dinner in your honor at Rocky Point Manor.
I assumed it was for being able to fart the alphabet, which I almost did till I pooped on the S.
She came into my life as if out of nowhere, enchanted me beyond my wildest dreams, and opened my eyes to the cleansing truth of Jesus Christ's love.
A member of Mensa, a huge hit with the ladies, someone who, you know, would have broken out bigger if he weren't so impossible to work with.
All right, since it's my fault that Joe got knocked out, it is now my responsibility to take over the investigation.
No. Actually, I was a normal guy until one night, we dropped acid together, and he thought I was a steak.
Why don't you come over to my place for a glass of wine and a couple of fruit pies, and then we can go in the back room and play crazy snake. Hee-hee-hee!

Well, I suppose it all really began a year ago when James Woods and I met at a press event and began seeing each other.
She was so anxious to get into the reporting business and would have done anything to get on my good side.
I paid her off to seduce James Woods and reel him into a relationship like a fish on a line.
At my direction, she persuaded him to become a born-again Christian, and instilled him with the drive to bring together all the people he'd wronged.
I planned to kill James Woods and frame Tom Tucker, thereby destroying the two people who cast me aside and ruined my life.
I had to leave the knife in her, because I couldn't very well hide it on my person with everyone quickly closing in.
I barely had enough time to plant the Golden Globe in Tom's room and run back downstairs, where I took advantage of the commotion and joined the crowd as they were all running outside.

I want to take a moment to give a shout-out to my good friend Ken Lay, faked his own death, listening in on a ham radio somewhere in international waters.
You strap her to a board, put a cloth in her mouth and pour water over it to simulate drowning.
Brian, look, there is no victory unless people know why they were wrong to disagree with you in the first place.
No, I'm here to strap you to a board, put a cloth in your mouth and pour water over it to simulate the sensation of drowning.
It's not a coincidence you turned your back on your democratic principles just when the Democrats became the political establishment.
Right there. See, the fact that you would give a woman credit for anything... it means you're a liberal, Brian.

God, you know, Stewie, I-I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's like,

How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing Renee Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant?
Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state?
I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, less substance than an issue of TV Guide.
Actually, it, it, I mean, it seems that these sorts of books tend to pander to the laziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range.
I mean, yeah, you u can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, like, what, five per cent of the country has.
Well, yeah, you forgot want it, which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know...
I think what this is is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful like legitimate healthcare that they actually need.
Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, like, a quick fix to any and every problem that you would ever have, what books like these suggest is actually damaging to a large, gullible segment of the population.
If I didn't know what it meant, I wouldn't use it, Dana-- which... which is a girl's name-- and I'm...

All right, Stewie, I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle.
That waiting in line is such a catastrophe for you that you'd rather destroy the confidence of a five-year-old cancer patient?
Yeah, yeah. And I want a Charles in Charge lunch box and I want a Magna Doodle and a new Uno game on a 'cause of I lost the Draw 2 card.
Look, Stewie, I know you're disappointed that you didn't get to see Santa, but I... I'm not driving you to the North Pole.
Now you get your ass back into that hippie car of yours and take me to the North Pole now!
Look, I know you're upset, but why... Why don't you just sit down, write out your Christmas list, and I promise I will mail it to Santa Claus?
I'm gonna see the workshop, pet a few reindeer, take a few pictures of me and Santa, and then I'm gonna blow his brains out, hopefully with his bitch wife watching.
Because when you get there, you may find out it isn't what you thought it was, and I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.
Well, you know, if you had just taken me to the real North Pole to see Santa, none of this would have happened!
You do what you want, Brian, but I am going to the North Pole and I'm gonna kill that bastard!
I'll tell you what, you take me to the North Pole, and if Santa isn't there, I'll do something for you.
Look, we don't have enough cash to fix the car, and we're kind of on our way to the North Pole.
I received a call about notarizing a document, but I am spending the day with my family, so they are here, too.

Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid all the toxic chemicals your husband ingested from his homemade energy drink have caused total kidney failure.
President Barack Obama, it will be a very big day for one local teenager who will be reading his essay to introduce the President.
I sat down with accomplished wordsmith Chris Griffin. Hope is a horizon we head for, leaving nothing behind us but fear.
Well, as I said, Mrs. Griffin, he's on a list, but there are a lot of people ahead of him.
But it turns out you are a match for a little girl who's dying in that next room over there.
Okay, Doc, we gotta have a talk at some point, but Brian, are... Are you... Are you sure about this?
Now, since the operation is tomorrow, I thought it might be a good idea to just kinda close the book, you know?

And, Lois, I only ask this because of the dire situation I'm in, but... can I, can I hump your leg for fifteen uninterrupted seconds?

And don't forget, next weekend, we will have the Sunday afternoon family picnic... as God said to Noah... weather permitting.
And after what I went through with Diane Simmons, well, let me just say it's nice to be standing here with no one trying to murder me.

If you own the choice that you made, you take away all their power to make you feel bad about yourself.
Well, you remember a few years back, people used to make all those jokes about how Ryan Seacrest was gay?
I mean, he's still gay, but now it's no fun to joke about it, because he beat us to the punch.
And so did the Corinthians finally write back to Saint Paul, saying, Dude, enough with the letters. We have received them all, and will get back to you when we have the time. And by the way, a lot of the information you're asking for is available online.

This one time, me and Joe and Quagmire made a bet to see who could drink the most beer and still drive.
I see you got your own thing going on this week, but there's a new teacher at preschool who deactivates the camera and then hits us.
She slams us into the monkey bars, but none of us have the language skills to call her on it.
I sat here and listened to you bums the other day, and I got to tell you, I have never seen a duller bunch of pathetic bastards in my life.
I don't know who you were when you were drinking, but it sure as hell's got to be better than who you are when you're sober.
So I did... So I just put my thumb over it, and then... And that got me through the rest of... of the... of the session.
One time, I took a liberry book out, and I fells asleep reading it, and I left it under the bed.
I was going to take it back on Amnesty Day, but on Amnesty Day, I had a sip of rosé wine, and I never made it out of the house.

Most of the surviving American pilots were taken to POW camps, but for some reason, they thought I was gay, so I was taken to a concentration camp.

Clean your pool with my shirt off, or wash your car in jean shorts, bend over in front of you to get little bits of lint out of the rug?
Say, listen, my wife and I appreciate how nice you've been to my son with all the puppets and whatnot, and, uh, we wanted to invite you over for dinner.
Now we can't fit through the window, but maybe there's some way we can let people know we're down here.
You know, I gotta say, Chris, all my life I wanted to see you locked in a basement, but now that it's happened, all I want to do is get you out.
Hi, Lois, um, I hate to bother you, but I'm going out of town for a few days to visit my father in the hospital.
I mean, when was the last time you tried to blow something up, or take over the world, or even used the phrase, Damn you?
Oh yeah, I just wanted to make sure you got a nice hot breakfast before you head off to work.
If I can decode the genetic puzzle of this being, perhaps I can determine how to apply it to my own neurological makeup.
Oh, yeah. Susie spit up on me, and I didn't want to go all the way home, so I just threw this on.
I wouldn't have created Evil Stewie, he wouldn't have escaped and we wouldn't be trying to track down a murderer.
And I don't really know how to break it to you, so I'm just going to come right out and say it.
Look, Meg, I do care for you, but I care for you like I... I would a niece or a good friend's daughter.
We interrupt this program because I have had kind of a crap day, and I know all the station passwords to do it.
Okay, our top story tonight: A local car dealer has announced a Hands on a Hard Body promotion in which a used dirt bike will be reward... awarded to the one customer who can successfully outlast his competitors.
And the lucky one of you who can keep his or her hand on this dirt bike for the longest amount of time will get to take it home!
No, Lois! I will not allow you to look down on Amber just 'cause she goes to an alternative high school!
Fact is, she rumpled up some poetry she wrote and threw it away in a fit, but I un-rumpled it, and it was really good!
You know, I don't think you kids appreciate how hard your father and I work to provide you with everything we do.
I bet you Lois Griffin doesn't make the track team, which is an important thing in high school right now.
Seems like you don't have a choice but to let Chris work at the brewery until Peter finds a new job.
What... What the hell is it with that school that every time you walk in there somebody wants ten dollars?!

I don't, I don't think he's got the leverage to Rita Wilson her around town anymore. I mean, I... I... That's...
Oh, yeah. I went to the first part of that, but then some fireworks went off and I ran for two miles straight.
Well, you know, listen. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for yourself, why don't you take Quagmire's class on picking up chicks?
You know, I came here 'cause I thought I'd made a mistake by not giving you a chance, but it's obvious you're just another typical jerk.
But if you ask me, she got lucky, because now she's dodged the bullet of being in a relationship with a loser like you.
Well, you know, it's been so many years, and I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd just drop by and say hi.
But then he started saying things to me that my father might say if he were still alive, and I knew I liked him.
Did Brian ever tell you he once had a tick on the back of his neck that he couldn't reach with his mouth, and it swelled up to the size of a ping-pong ball?

I'm just saying that if you read somewhere that Gwen Stefani was a grandmother, you might not even bat an eye.
Your Aunt Carol's going to be staying with us for a little while, so she's going to need your room.
She has such low self-esteem that every time a man shows her the slightest glimmer of attention, she rushes into something serious and gets her heart broken like a teenage girl.
Well, what we're discussing is whether or not marriage is a smart move for Carol at this point in time.
We bonded over the Red Sox one time, and now he's got to bring it up every time I see him.
Well, that's what I tried to tell you, but you were as stubborn as a pigeon at an ad agency.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, these are all good ideas, but I think what people really get excited about is dropped museum popcorn.
Hey, you know, when it's your turn to say, I do, you should say, I do the Dew, and then... and then we both pull out a Mountain Dew, and then I'll... I'll... And then I do, like, a radical skateboard jump off the altar.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
You-you would take the magazine and you'd put it on the floor and pee on it 'cause you're a dog and you're stupid, and-and you have a weird toenail halfway up your elbow.
Brian, can I give you money and you write me a check so I can order something from this Abercrombie & Fitch catalog?
Yeah, if you could just grab some rocks, Neil, throw 'em in a bag, we'll get you home safe and sound.
Hey, you remember a few months ago when you scored that date with that Victoria's Secret model and then ended up sealing the deal?
It operates according to the laws of physics, but we're outside the space-time continuum, so there are no laws of physics-- watch.
Well, if I overload the return pad's reactor, it might release enough energy to blow us back into the universe, but it's too risky.
And if you don't, I am gonna spend the rest of eternity chuckling at a joke that I am not gonna share with you.
Yeah, the theory that the universe started with a massive outward explosion from a singularity of infinite mass and infinite density.
The universe's cosmic background radiation, a kind of echo of the big bang, precisely matches the energy spectrum of my return pad!
You know, it's funny, I had actually stopped playing with that toy, but now that I see you with it,
Ah, you're forgetting I initially encountered Bertram as a sperm in one of the fat man's balls, so he couldn't get rid of the fat man or any recent ancestor on my father's side.
Bertram had to go back enough generations to make sure he was snuffing out the ancestral source of my genius without affecting his own.
Brian and I were trapped outside the space-time continuum and the only way for us to get back was to overload my old return pad!
It was left to us by Leonardo da Vinci himself, with instructions that it be delivered to you on this exact-a date at this exact-a time.
So I've built a cryogenic stasis device, and am placing myself inside it, leaving instructions for it to be buried in very specific coordinates in what will be future Quahog.
I put a sample of my DNA in a syringe and I injected her on the staircase, the couch and the balcony.

Bonnie, não achei que chegaria a esse ponto, mas vejo que só resta uma maneira pra eu provar meu amor por você.

When we arrive at Endor, we will destroy the Death Star and then begin setting up the Ewok reassignment camps.
All right. Now I want you to take off your helmets, go outside and dig your own graves with them.
And then go home to his family still wearing his face, and see how long it takes them to figure out that it's you and not him.
Come on. Take that lightsaber and try to strike me down, and your journey toward the dark side will be complete.
What, because of Seth Green? Do you ever hear anyone say, Hey, let's go see that new Austin Powers, Seth Green's in it?
I don't know. He was up there like, I can't do this, I threw the thing, and I just meant to hit him in the arm, and then the whole thing fell.
Can we at least put together a press release that says I'm resigning of my own accord to pursue other evil projects?
What's going on, Lois, is that this girl is obviously not well, and I have just learned that she's been stealing from the show, and she should probably be escorted out of the building.
We're here live in our studio where a checkout girl in a cheap dress who wants to be a model is ready to draw the winning numbers. E!
A static shot of the house where night turns into day or a montage song that over-explains what we're doing?
I just bought a giant room full of gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck.
Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk.
Well, my friend Marty is a whiz with chemistry, and he says he's come up with a new penis enlargement pill, and if we can bankroll him $100,000 in startup money, he'll triple our investment in a year.
Bonnie's birthday is coming up, and I'll be gol-darned if I didn't go ahead and promise her that Stevie Nicks would come to our house and sing three songs to her.
Hey, Peter, you wanted me to watch the entire first season of True Blood and come show you where there was boob?
Okay, Quagmire, I want you to take the first bite out of this fudge pop, because that first bite is the one that really hurts.
Okay, guys, now you're gonna do a synchronized duet of Makin' Whoopee while I shoot you with this BB gun.
You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning, and she said you haven't talked to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks.
Waiter, have the chef prepare a bucket of your finest caviar, and then give it a helicopter tour of the city.
I thought being rich would solve all my problems, but all it did was make me forget what was important.
I don't expect you to forgive me, but if, for some reason, you do, you can find me in a cardboard box on the corner of Meeting and Thayer.
The National Weather Service has issued a Severe Hurricane Advisory, and is urging everyone to stay indoors for at least the next 36 hours.
(with Spanish accent): Hey, kids... if you have an open wound, get some dirt or kitty litter and rub it in there to stop the bleeding.
I figure we're going to be stuck inside f a while with this storm, so it'll be a fun way to pass the time. Okay.
I-I-I-I have a lot of friends who do it, and they're willing to do it around me all the time, because they know I'm so cool about it and I don't judge them.
What if I started calling you a fat, zitty loser, who has no friends and smells like an old woman who has birds for pets?
Meg seems to think she's taking some kind of stand here that's gonna make us all feel like we're inadequate.
NARRATOR: Having been officially challenged by her natural enemy, the black female prepares for combat by taking off her many rings.
Meanwhile, the Italian male looks around to make sure the other Italian males are indeed seeing what he is seeing.
Sensing the impending battle, a flock of Jews flies quickly away, as avoiding confrontation is their best chance for survival.
The shoplifter, the drug addict, the porn star, the whore who let Gene Simmons and Bill Clinton go to town on her?
What's your point, Meg? My point is that with all the irresponsible, reckless, idiotic behavior in your past, that somehow, somehow you have the nerve, the arrogance to consistently and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings.
You're my mother, and you took a child's trust and smashed it into bits in a 17-year-long mission to destroy something that you killed a long time ago.
You have no education, you have no interests, you just do whatever reckless thing you want to do whenever you want to do it without regard for anyone else.
Oh, oh, and when you're not terrorizing the community with your impulsive escapades, you're being a total jerk to your family.
You are a fat, lazy, abusive, blue-collar Irish Catholic dad who drinks way too much and barely makes enough money to support his family.
Do you think it's possible that... that this family can't survive without some sort of lightning rod to absorb all the dysfunction?
I mean, it-- it's not ideal, but it's an important piece that maybe it's just my lot in life to provide.
What? Mom, you're an amazing mother and all the things I said about you were out of anger, and I didn't mean any of them.
And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but then they're always like, Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?
It's like a surprise birthday party, but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves.
Now, I know it's going to be a long day, but we're all here because we care about her very much.
So we're going to say a few things, and then you'll say a few things, and then we'll be done.
All right, so we're going to go around the room and tell you exactly how your situation has affected each of us.
Please, I'd like to say something, if I may. Brenda, the fact that you are being abused has affected my life in the following ways: The sister that I knew and loved growing up no longer exists. The person I see before me now is just a punching bag. And I call you 'person' and not 'woman' because a woman is a strong, beautiful, vibrant creature. A woman embraces life. A woman makes choices to make her life better. Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff, proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse.
But you know, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days when a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his (bleep) ass?
Y-you think they ever suddenly wake up and realize the error of their ways and clean up their act? No!
Here's a bunch of words in a row: because the economy's so bad, they've decided they're gonna shut down all the prisons.
Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes of kissing first or Eddie Izzard in drag, but he has a working vagina?
Yeah, we found this note he left you. Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you. I realized that you are too good for me, and you and our unborn child would be better off without me in the picture. Love, Jeff. P.S. If the cops ask, tell them that Joe, Peter and Quagmire were with you last night. If you tell anyone otherwise, I will come back and not only hit you, but I will murder you. And no one will care because you're garbage.
And that was Baby by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris, which means it's time to give away some Justin Bieber tickets.
I should try to win those Justin Bieber tickets just so I can, like, tear them up or use them to go to t concert.
You know, Ryan, most people take one look at me and just assume that I have plans, so I never get asked out.
Yes! Oh, my God, right now would be the worst time for you to tickle my lower abdomen, because it's so exposed 'cause I'm cheering.
But you'll have to pack your chalk because you're going to be staying six days and seven nights at your parents' house in Wilmington, Delaware!
Um, hey, thanks for taking me out to dinner, Ryan, but I got to say, this food looks a little weird.
And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on the plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers.
For example, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around, watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but who after you told her of your intentions, said, Go get him, child, in flagrant disregard of all newly-implemented post-9-11 security measures.
And if you were considerin bringing a boom box to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs.
When you live out in Hollywood, you learn that life is about different spirits and energies you meet along the way.
Look, I thought about it, and to be honest, it's probably my fault for leaving you alone in the car.
Just make a mental note of where you buried it, and as soon as we're back in the present, you can dig it up then.
I shall cleverly disguise this lethal plasma disruptor device as a tuna fish sandwich, whereupon I shall end that wretched woman's Draconian reign of tyranny!
Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times; he may even be downright, well, stupid, but I know he only accepted that money because he...
It was ten years ago that an almost inconceivable plot to destroy the World Trade Center was thwarted by Quahog's own Brian Griffin.
This amateur video captured Griffin's heroism in the face of a shadowy terrorist organization called-- holy (bleep), look at all those vowels--
The announcement came from former President George W. Bush, who reformed the Confederacy after a bitter loss in his 2004 reelection bid.
Well, Brian, if you're that sure of yourself, then let's go five years into the future, and you can prove me wrong. Fine.
You know, I just want to say how nice it is to be back here with y'all on Spooner Street.
It says here that the new American civil war you set into motion ended up in a series of concentrated nuclear strikes all along the Eastern Seaboard.
Well, the only way to fix this is to return to the moment when we first arrived in the past and stop you from spilling the beans about 9/11.
You might be sitting here with a hole in your leg, but at least our present universe hasn't been affected.
We've got some on-and-off drizzle here today, and we're a little w, as you can see, because, apparently, there are no awnings that exist anywhere.
'Cause his bum doesn't open up to poo anymore, and a nurse has to go digging up there to get up after his stuff?
In some ways, Army life in Iraq is what you'd expect, what with the blistering heat, the constant sense of impending danger, and the one gay soldier awkwardly avoiding the use of pronouns.
Hey, when you get sexually abused while you're in a coma, do you know it's happening and just can't do anything about it?
Okay, now you eat up, and then we're all gonna go out back and play some Thanksgiving touch football-- excuse me: war hero Thanksgiving touch football.
(slurring): I work hard to put a cornucopia on this table, and you're out showing your lower ankle to every Tom, Tom, and other Tom in our village!
One-one time this homeless guy showed me his purple head, but looking back, I'm-I'm not so sure that that was really a military thing.
All it did was put me in a coma and kill one of my bunkmates and cripple the other one for life.
But just looking down at his dead face and knowing that he lived near someone who worked with the dad of the kid whose name I never found out, I lost all hope.
And the war we started in Iraq has killed a half a million of their people, which is like 200 9/11's.
Look, I think you guys are all rushing to judge Kevin without knowing what it was like to be in his shoes.
He saw horrific things, in a horrific war, that only one other person here could possibly come close to understanding: Ida.
Son, when you go to war, you don't end up fighting for your country or your family or your flag.
I just came over to tell you what a great guy your father is and how hard he's been working for all of you.
You knew what your duty told you you were supposed to do, but instead, you did what you thought was right.
You know, I think they kind of figured that movie was going to turn out to be bigger than it was.
Big news out of Six Flags Columbus today, as they unveil what promises to be the largest roller coaster in the United States.
Now no matter how many beckoning fingers that steam morphs into or how badly it tries to sneak its way up your nose, I want you to resist the urge to levitate off the ground and float towards the pie.
Peter, I don't understand why we have to drive all the way to Ohio to ride a stupid roller coaster.
Now remember, there are no rules about who can wear stretch pants here, so you're going to see some pretty shocking things.
We do not see many of your folk in these parts, but we welcome all of God's children in their hour of need.
We have one where some Italian backpackers have laid out every item of clothing they own on all of the beds.
Uh, also, I'm going to have some mail delivered here, and I want it to sit in that box for four years.
Dear Amish Lord, thou looketh sternly down upon us thine flock, even though we did not do anything wrong and have been doing chores like (bleep) crazy, please make us humble, and deliver us more hardship, that we may get thick, calloused hands, much larger than other people's.
And grant that we become dull, like Eric Bana, who we have never seen, but are just going by reputation because it is your will.
We solemnly believe that although humans have been around for a million years, you feel strongly that they had just the right amount of technology between 1835 and 1850; not too little, not too much.
Look, I-I know you guys are busy with your barn raising and all, but, um, you know, I just wanted to tell you how much my daughter Meg loves your boy Eli.
Well, I mean, you remember how a lot of people said, like, Oh, Ubama's not gonna be able to do it, but he's-he's hanging in there.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, you want to buy some candy bars so we can get some new uniforms for our baseball team?
Would you rather be a hobo with a five percent chance of getting inherited by a rich guy or be Hitler two years before the end of World War II?
As Hitler, can I change certain policies so that maybe I'm looked on more favorably at the end of the war?
We left Quahog to find adventure and get away from all those lame chores at home, but I'll tell you this.
I put in a call from the McDaniel's pay phone while you guys were getting that nine-piece chicken McFingers and those Diet Conks and those Fresh Fries.
And as a law enforcement professional, you have an obligation to be more ethically upstanding than the average man, not less.
Coming up, we talk to a man on the street while a man further back on the street flips you off.
I'm standing here surrounded by snowdrifts, stalled cars, and the one douchebag who wears a tank top every time there's a blizzard.
I was having fun playing in the snow, and now you've ruined it, like a pizza place ruins a salad.
Please, Joe, I know he had an accident, but can't you look the other way this one time as a friend?
Besides, you're always complaining that you don't have enough time to play polo or sit in a chair and moisten your mouth.
Oh. I mean this, um, redheaded lady who lives in my bed was a real pain in the ass this morning.
Yeah, all he ever does is ask you what you want to do so he can shoot it down and tell you what he wants to do.
All right, I just got to go take a misty, stop-and-go piss in your bathroom, then we'll be good to go.
Well, we were just thinking, now that Daddy's retired that you and he might be happier in a place where you can be with people your own age.
Protect us, oh, Lansbury, from rude teenagers, from soup that is both too hot and too cold, and from anyone who calls, but please have people call.
Our state-of-the-art movie theater is equipped with some terrific innovations to cater to our residents, including a button on every seat that will pause the film whenever anyone has a question.
This guy worked and worked and never wanted to retire, even though it would've been the best thing for him.
You give me just one day to show you how great retired life can be for an old fella, and I'll let you honk the horn one time.
All right, Mr. Pewterschmidt, now, you know how in your building your office temperature was controlled by a central air system that you had nothing to do with? Yeah, I hated that.
Hi. I just moved into the neighborhood, and I'm required by law to inform you that I am a sex offender.
We use the abbreviation S.O's because it saves a lot of time over saying Sex Offender, because that's all we talk about.
Aw, that sounds like the sad little fat girl who lives in all of us and is struggling to get out.
Margot, it's time to take this company in a new direction-- starting with being honest with the IRS about our profits.
You guys, don't you think I'm a little old for the Teen Choice Awards? I mean, I turned 18 today.
Yeah, ever since Fox pulled this contrived night of  out of their ass, in an effort to get in on the awards show business, it's been very special to you.
No party? Oh, come on. I was gonna show a slide show of all those silly photos I took of Meg.
I trusted my training, and brought the plane in safely, and in fact, it turned out, ironically, to be one of the smoothest landings I've ever made.
Well, gosh, Quagmire, this has been a fun night, but I guess, uh, you better be getting home now, huh?
We now return to Grainy Footage of a Potential Bigfoot that will surely spark a lively debate in your household.
Mr. Pewterschmidt, we pumped your daughter's stomach and we found vodka, Rohypnol, a fair amount of DNA that is not her own and a class ring.
Me, too, Glenn. God, it's so amazing that you've been my dad's friend for, like, years, and now we have this connection.
You know, whether it's just that she's not listening or whether it's that she's making a conscious decision to defy your wishes, who can say, you know?
And I would say, in some respects, having a strong-willed kid is a good thing, but it can get frustrating as hell on the other side.
I want to help you, Peter, I really do, but it's-- it's like you're asking a fish not to swim.
It's one thing to rebelliously flaunt an older guy in front of your parents, but it's a whole other thing to go away with him for the weekend to his sex cabin.
Look, everyone knows if you go away with a guy for the weekend and don't have sex with him, you're a huge bitch.
One time, my friends and I went camping, and nobody could start a campfire, and then I tried to start the campfire, and I could.
You may be an adult, but you're still my daughter, and it's my job to protect you from errant wieners.
So, I don't care how old you are, you're going to do what I say and get in the damn car!
You know, Mom and Dad, I'm really glad that you kept me from doing what I was going to do.
'Cause I got one in the pocket right now, and I want to know if I need to feel self-conscious about it.
The old ones were so rough, and Stewie got that splinter, so I thought replacing the wood was the best way to go.
Yeah, well, you know, I read somewhere that women decide within the first seven seconds if they're interested in you or not, so I figured I wouldn't waste anybody's time.
Well, I mean, I just don't know how much fun it is for a blind person to go to the movies.
I might be blind, but my brain has been trained to listen to any movie and know exactly what's happening on screen.
And by the time I tell her, I'll have impressed her so much that the dog thing won't even matter.
Look, you can't expect to hire 60 workers to dig a cave under your house and then keep it a secret.
I don't care how many of you there are-- you're not taking this purse! Ah, the hell we aren't. Let's get him, boys!
I made a nest of my old underwears on which to lay my eggs, and I shall raise my young in this room alone.
I thought, if we got to know each other better first, you would eventually be able to see past it. See.
I could have gotten over the fact that you're a dog, because I really do care about you and I feel like we had a connection, but I can't get over the fact that you lied to me.
Well, since Kate is blind, you could probably just do a different voice and go out with her all over again.
There's a huge rock right there, and it's covered up by grass and there's no way you can see it.
But someone else could hurt themselves, and, and a small cut is a, is a death sentence in these times, so let's just, you know, let's... let's get these rocks out of here.
He wouldn't be able to get to Cybertron because he lives in Eternia, and Eternia is in an entirely different dimension.
I don't know, I didn't read the whole Wikipedia entry, but the good news is that what he has is highly treatable with radiation first, and if necessary, chemotherapy.
Is that, is that that thing all them gaybo Hollywood actors do to keep their stuff away from other guys' butts?
Well, that may be, Meg, but that poor little baby has cancer, and they're just gonna take him home and pray over him?!
And maybe this dog will fetch a stick and bring me my slippers instead of prattling on about the pros and cons of various religions!
During his 22-year reign, this French monarch known as The Spider King had an ongoing feud with Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.
Look, I don't mean to question your religious beliefs, but as a mother, I just can't bear the thought of little Scotty not getting the help he needs.
Look, we appreciate your concern, Lois, but Scotty is our son, and we have to tend to him as we see fit.
We believe that the Lord is our Savior, and we remember Him by going to church and praising Him every Sunday.
I know it's frustrating, Lois, but the fact is, there are no laws that say those people have to take their child to the doctor.
You could file a suit, but that could take months, and even then, there's no guarantee the court wouldn't support the parents' right to practice their religion.
Come up and have sex with me some time. Van full of Peters who all have stern faces because they're about to pull off a heist?
Okay, so I'll go get the baby, and while I'm doing that, maybe you do something about that snatchy tone.
Also arriving is my overprotective boyfriend, who is suspicious whenever I am called into work at night, even though I've been a reporter for years, Tyrone.
I promise, when this is over, I'll gladly go to prison for the rest of my life, but not until I bring this defenseless child into the hospital to get him the treatment he deserves.
And through the years, when there was disease or infection, people of good faith would pray to God for a cure.
And isn't it possible that the amazing men and women of medicine who brought about these miracles could be the instruments of God's answers to our prayers?
And if that's true, then I think it's wrong for you to ignore what very well could be the Lord's will.
I mean, what's the point in praying to God if you're just going to wipe your butt with his answers?
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker, and the reason I'm wearing this mask is because we've got a Make-A-Wish kid in the studio tonight, who, as you'll find out as the show goes on, is quite a cougher.
You know, Tom, I haven't seen you in a mask since you went under the stage name George P. Wilbur.
I just found out that you were the guy who played Michael Myers in Halloween 4, and I just want to say,
I think that was the most brilliant performance ever in the history of everything, and I wanted to see if you would sign my DVD.
Well, I tried to make a career out there in Hollywood, but I just didn't realize how tough acting is.
Well, you've brought me so much joy over the years as that lovable murderer of teenagers, and I want to return the favor.
As I understand it, they would put the coal inside of that, and then put the object between the sheets.
You see, everybody needs just one person to believe in their dreams so they can spread their wings and fly.
Don't be silly, Tom-- you're an actor, and this is where you belong. Now, let's take some of this complimentary luggage and get going.
You just sit back and let your agent knock on every door in Hollywood till he gets you an acting job.
Yes, I will have the Big and Fancy, and my client here will have a bottle of your best steak.
You know, Lindsey, I just want to say how nice it is to have such a beautiful young woman in our home.
Lois, don't you think maybe part of the reason you like Lindsey could be because she looks so much like you?
All you've got is a worn-out rope toy and that squirrel who comes by once a day to taunt you.
Peter, I need you to drop Stewie off at day care, and then shred this big stack of old bank statements.
You know, everyone said, Don't smoke during your pregnancy, but I think some of it rubbed off on him 'cause now he's cool.
Well, we're making a mediocre action film, and we think James is just the guy to do a serviceable job in a supporting role that Jeremy Irons, Jeff Goldblum, and Craig T. Nelson have already passed on.
I just met this and I can't decide whether to take her home or keep doing blow with Tom Sizemore and see if I can do better later in the night.
I need a drugs guy, a girls guy, a fitness guy, a guy with a boat who can dump stuff way-out-there kind of guy.
Tom, I think I speak for all of us here at Channel Five News when I say it's good to have you back here at half your original salary.
So head on down before the gays turn it into a cruising ground like they did the Barnes and Noble upstairs coffee bar, which they had to close.
A ferry carrying a shipment of brand-new Mercedes Benzes from Germany crashed and sank just a few miles off our coast.
You know, a lot of us here at Family Guy are, frankly, sickened by the sorry state of education in this country and how little you people read anymore.
Really? That seems weird. Yeah, and is it normal that Miss Emily tied us all to the sink while she went out to return a birthday present?
Me and my mates, right, we was having a laugh sitting in of one of them, pretending to be people.
And I should know, 'cause I went down on the floor, thinking it had to be a lot better than the couch.
And, again, I'm gonna ask one more question, and don't take this the wrong way, but have you actually got a penis?
Billy blurts out, he goes, he goes, You know, those firemen showed up to get a cat out of the tree, but it turns out it's really Marmaduke up there.
I tell ya, he was fun at first, but now I'm not sure I can take much more of him living here.
Plus, the sooner we get him out of here, the sooner I can get back to my cocaine and dollhouses.
I finally stood up for all of us and told Miss Emily we should be given a proper lunch and not just what's left over from her Baja Fresh.
And she said I shouldn't raise my voice and pulled me really hard into the other room, and my arm came out of its socket.
I finally have a date with Miss Emily tomorrow, and I'm not gonna let you or anybody else get in my way until I have seen every inch of her naked.
Hey, uh, listen, Billy, it's been fun having you stay here, but we really need to talk about making some new arrangements.
'cause it dawned on me that the only thing better than you having one of them would be you having two of them.
See, I'm gonna help Billy get back together with his wife, and then he'll move out and stop annoying us.
It was just a dumb plan my buddies and I put together because we know how much Billy loves you.
You know what? I had to live on the land to learn there might be a million fish in the sea, but there's only one you.
I don't see it. You mean, next to the Kadima paddles, or next to the basic black sweatshirt with no writing on it?
No, I think they're over there between the rain ponchos and the cap guns and just below the balsa wood gliders and the net-bag of flip-flops and a beach pail.
Yes, above the jacks and the bicentennial playing cards and across from the giant cage with the beach balls, next to the Wiffle ball bats and the spark-spitting cars.
She could get away with overcharging people, because they were always mentally undressing her and then re-dressing her once they saw the horrible mess underneath.
Okay, Mort, now, if you want to get more customers in your pharmacy, you're gonna have to do a promotion, like... like buy one, get one free.
Oh, 'cause it seems like you're saying the first part in English and then some kind of made-up pha-lumpf-phalumpf or something in the second part.
That's right, bring in the city folk with their big money and their long cigarettes and their dogs with shoes.
Grim details continue to roll in at this hour in the story of the detached airplane advertising banner which caused a school bus to plummet into the Pawtuxet River.
Quahog's own Goldman's Pharmacy made headlines across the country after a banner of theirs caused the bus to drive off a bridge, tragically killing all the teenagers on board.
A friend of mine staying in my house got, um, injured, and my homeowner's insurance wouldn't pay her doctor bills.
Yeah, come to think of it, they wouldn't even pay for the fetus Lois lost when we went to visit the Museum of Staircases and Spring-loaded Boxing Gloves.
If we put it on the electric box and two of the outlets, then light them all at once, it'll look like a short circuit.
Okay, well... I'm sorry for your loss, but the good news is your insurance will be covering all of your damages.
All right, guys, all we got to do now is keep a low profile and not mention a word of this to anybody.
Hmm. These burn ignition patterns aren't consistent with an electrical fire. Would... love to. Probably... about 7:00... or 7:30. Any... of... those places would be... fine.
God! No way! I don't know Probably just a collared shirt and jeans. Have you never been to... a restaurant before?
But if you think you have what it takes to beat the best eater in the world, come down to the James Woods High parking lot this Saturday with $50 and a large appetite.
All right, Chris, if we're gonna pay the entry fee for that eating contest, we got to sell some of my old stuff.
So then, the man, weak with hunger, raced from the refrigerator to the counter to look for a delivery menu, but all he could find was one for a vegan place!
This one time, I was on a city bus, and the guy next to me was eating a bucket of fried chicken.
Good thing there wasn't land or else you'd have to meet the natives with that mustard stain on your shirt. What stain?
I saw a forest like this in a book one time, and I know there's a gingerbread house out here somewhere.
I mean, who better to get inside the mind of someone who's strangling fat people than someone who's done it himself?
Now, I'm gonna need you to squats down like your underwears is done for, but you might still save the jeans.
All right, look, we know we woke up in the hospital, so maybe there was some kind of catastrophe that we were all spared.
Hey, you know, if we're all gonna be tryin' to figure this out together, maybe it would be easier if we gave each other names.
I bet I was a doctor who had to deal with a lot of serious stuff, but always found a way to keep things light.
Well, it's good we found out who we all are, but we still haven't found out what the hell happened to everybody else.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that, and I think the best course of action is for us to just go ahead and start repopulating the Earth.
There's a bedroom upstairs that belonged to some girl, and she's got bras in there, and the cups are different sizes.
I just took a bunch of random stuff I found in my medicine cabinet, and you're really freaking me out right now.
Not all of us. Somebody's gotta go over there and keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.
I thought it was a dog whistle, but now I'm thinking it's something you jam in your urethra to make you last longer.
Man, I wonder if I'm one of those secret assassins who doesn't even know it, but I'm a highly trained killing machine.
Hey, I know we're the only people on Earth and all, but what's with all these Mexicans coming here to steal our jobs?
You know, you ever think if we could all just spend more time celebrating our similarities instead of just standing on our differences, the universe would be a much better place?
Look, there's pretty solid evidence that this guy is responsible for the elimination of the entire human race, and we need to take him out.
Well, I wanted to prove to you that I was right, that your friendship was purely a result of circumstance.
So I created a scenario in which everyone's memories were erased, to demonstrate that you and Peter would never naturally associate with one another.
And if he's not smothering me, he's keeping me up all night writing with that giant plume of his. Dearest Augustine, I do hope this latest damp has not aggravated your gray lung.
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip. Matters stateside have taken a tragic turn as this year's gourd crop has fallen prey to a rather unexpected infestation of saltmarsh cutworms.
I bought that to kill the women from Sex and the City, but time seems to be doing it for me.
I've never said this to anyone before, but I feel like I may have finally found, in you, my one true soul mate.
Men need someone to spoon with and snuggle with just the same as women, and when you don't have that, it-it's...
I would like for you to sleep with me in my bed, and this, this is not about sex; it's about sleep.
I know, which is why I just planted another bomb that's set to go off every time he burps into his hand.
We blew up the Great Wall of China, bombed the Eiffel Tower, a look at this note I sent off. Dear Pakistan, Up yours.
Our top story: Authorities are still searching for the culprits in a series of horrific acts of destruction all across-- scroll down, guys-- the globe.
Look, in the past you've done terrible things, but it's always been about the pursuit of your greater goal of world domination.
Look, Peter, if you come home now, we can get our old bed back, and you can snuge with me as much as you want.
Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
And if he's not smothering me, he's keeping me up all night writing with that giant plume of his. Dearest Augustine, I do hope this latest damp has not aggravated your gray lung.

Penelope told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
I will never be able to find you, but what I do have is two dollars and a Casio wristwatch.
All right, I've booked us on a flight that leaves in two hours, so, um, whose credit card shall we put it on?
I'll-I'll put it on my card, but I-I-I'm just gonna say it's a gift because that's the only way I can do this anymore.
All right, the first thing we've got to do when we land is check the apartment where Meg was abducted and see if we can find some clues.
The, um... the, passengers had, uh, just signed up for a tour of the harbor and then all that stuff happened.
You know, maybe it'd help if we just tried to track Meg's movements from the moment she arrived in France.
We ask them what they want, and when they say Drakkar Noir-- which they all will-- we'll know if we have our man.
This next girl is perfect for those of you who want to buy a sex slave but don't want to spend sex-slave money.
I always tell them, Put the prisoners in the jail cell, but they always say, Just chain 'em up to a pipe.
I mean, one minute, I was being proposed to by a handsome Arabian prince, and the next thing I know,
Lois, I'd love nothing more than to sit here and chat with you, but I have a business to run.
The Tea Party has gained a sizable following based on their message of low taxes, limited government, and happy birthday, Tom...
Well, I'd like to be part of a movement, but what movement would want an angry fat guy with a lot of opinions who hates listening?
I finally got something better to do with my Saturdays than sit at the mall and watch Japanese girls laugh at normal conversation.
It's actually funded by Big Business types who are using you to get the government out of their way so they can roll over everyone.
This is what Brian was warning me about: that the Tea Party is run by rich guys who are only out for themselves.
I could actually use a regular guy like you to help get our message out, and I know Joe Workingman agrees with me.
Lois, I'm so glad you're done with the dishes so that you can hang out and chime in on this.
Our top story: Quahog is now completely government-free, which means I'm free of all broadcast regulations, so no more trips to the bathroom for this reporter, just a big-ass coffee can under the desk.
I think that we should elect some people to represent us, and they should make rules and choices on our behalf.
Now, this may be kind of expensive, so I got a plan: everyone should have to give some money from their salaries each year.
Poor people will give a little bit of money and rich people will give a larger amount of money, and our representatives will use all that money to hire some people who will then provide us with social order and basic services.
'cause later we're going to have more elections, and we can use those elections to get rid of the bad guys and replace 'em with good guys, and then the system will just keep going on and on just like that.
A few years ago, we did an episode called Viewer Mail where you, our fans, wrote in and suggested ideas for new episodes.
Uh, to Rashad in Little Rock, we wanna let you know we kicked around idea, Make the Baby Go Wild for a while, couldn't really find an angle on it.
Again? But Neville, you spend all your time down at the Fox and Pig and Dog and Wolf and Cat and Fiddle and Whistle and Cock.
We're meetin' at the Dog and Cat and Bull and Whistle and Fiddle and Cock and Pig and Wolf and Carriage and Fife and Other Wolf!
The field is teeming with men in helmets who don't seem like they need helmets, and men not in helmets who seem like they probably should be wearing helmets.
Robin Williams has a manic gift that gladdens a sad world and all he asks in return is our unceasing attention!
I don't know if those things are puppets or they put costumes on dogs or something, but let's press play and find out, huh?
That's right, Joyce. Apparently, there were 100 kilos of cocaine right here in Quahog, and yet my guy can't get dick.
It feels good to know that, thanks to me and my colleagues, a lot fewer people will be injecting cocaine into their penises tonight.
So, listen, if you guys aren't doing anything later, the chief's throwing me a little party to celebrate my bust.
Well, under normal circumstances, you'd be right to say that, but in this case, cheating would be the only fair thing.
Guys, am I the only one who thinks it's weird talking about Joe cheating on Bonnie in front of their baby?
Well, one of the dancers was dancing with a guy and saying, You're my favorite, you're my favorite, but now she's dancing with another guy.
But I'm gonna stare at his wife's boobs so hard that when they both go into the kitchen together, it will be discussed.
Tell him I'm a pathological liar and that I've been under a lot of stress because of the child rape charges I'm facing.
You think I liked sitting there pretending to be polite to those people while they talked down to us like that?
Lois, this is probably a terrible time to remember this, but I think I might have left the weed whacker on.
Like, ten is a suite at the Four Seasons, and one is a tied-up raincoat sleeve at a party in your honor.
Okay, the Fishmans are heading up the North Face, but I've been studying this map and I think we've got a better chance of beating them if we go up the South Face.
All right, everyone get into a hilarious pose, so when they dig out our bodies, they'll have a good laugh.
Oh, great. Not only are we caught in this blizzard, but there's some maniac up here freezing people to death.
Look, if we don't eat something soon, we're all gonna pass out from exhaustion and freeze to death just like him.
Plus, if we don't rescue the Fishmans, their Jewish god is just gonna sit there and make us feel guilty.
Now, few people realize that until 1928 there were no hoses, and you actually had to fight fires with your bare hands.
Hey, there's something here from the Nielsen Company. Dear Griffin family, You have been specially selected from amongst millions of American households to be a Nielsen family, and as such, to have your TV viewing habits monitored in order to measure television ratings.
Well, Meg, it sounds like they want us to be part of a select group of people that helps determine what's on TV.
Now, this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
Um... this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans.
And as per the wishes of my moustache, his ashes were sprinkled off the coast of Acapulco where he was born.
If he did the news with a family of prairie dogs, and whenever he said something sad, they'd pop their heads up, all concerned.
People rely on the local news to provide them with several stories a year on how saltwater taffy is made.
Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family, it seems like you should maybe be a little more thoughtful with your choices.
Chilling news from Long Island Sound, as a four-passenger prop plane on its way to East Hampton spun into the surf off Montauk Point.
I guess that means I'll never get to see an episode of Superman where Clark Kent and Lois Lane finally get together.
Just thought I'd stop by and make sure your equipment is working properly and see if you have any questions.
Listen, did I catch you at a good time, or are you and the critics busy sucking each other's butts?
You put a real cougar on Cougar Town, and now that cougar's dead because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws!
I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me?
Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today because you are the creators of what television used to be before I ruined it.
Wonder if I can pull off one of those can you believe what I have to put up with looks to the camera.
Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible, unforgiveable things to each other for embarrassingly small sums of money?
I was planning on looking at pictures of birds later, and I don't want to be all fuzzy-headed for that.
Although I'm not sure what the Spanish word no means, because it doesn't seem to mean the same thing as it does here.
And then we have a chocolate, chocolate cake that's infused with chocolate served with chocolate ice cream and a molten chocolate topping.
Yeah, I feel really horrible for you, and I hate to do this, but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie, and it's, like, 4:40 now, and, so, if I'm going to make it,
I'll tell ya, this obituary came out great. Carter Pewterschmidt died today of the disease cancer. In lieu of flowers, please send carnival rides to Peter Griffin at 31 Spooner Street.
If Carter Pewterschmidt, the dynamic chairman of Pewterschmidt Industries, were to fall ill or even die, the stock price would plummet.
But what I'm saying is, I think Carter is sick or possibly even dead, and that the man we saw today was an imposter brought in to keep
Why cure someone of cancer in a day if we can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step along the way?
Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt released a statement announcing the launch of a deodorant for the developmentally disabled called Slow Stick.

Well, I didn't want you to find out I'd been using it, so I tried turning the chronological gauge backward.
I don't know what the hell you did with all your messing around, Brian, but somehow my machine seems to have reversed the direction of time.
Well, clearly, when you attempted to reverse the gauge on my time machine, you somehow released a quantum shock wave powerful enough to push the flow of time in the opposite direction.
I can only surmise that you and I were isolated from its effects because we were inside the machine at the moment of temporal inversion.
Well, it's gonna take a while to rebuild the machine, and even longer to recalibrate it for normal time, but I've taken on bigger challenges before.
(squeaking) Your trash barrels were a little close to our driveway. Joe. P.S. Please close the windows when you're giving piano lessons.
Time dilation, in forward time, is a phenomenon caused by a variety of factors in which time moves more slowly.
Now all I've got to do is isolate the cause of the acceleration curve and see if I can duplicate the shock wave.
All right, I was standing right here, the machine was on, I broke the glass... and I turned the gauge backward.
This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby The Shirt Briggs, notorious for always wearing shirts while committing his crimes, has finally been caught after 15 years on the lam.
Briggs was one of the biggest heroin dealers east of Providence, which is mostly just open water, but still, I'd been undercover, tracking his operation for six months and had finally gained his confidence.
I had almost gathered enough evidence to put Briggsaway for good, but I knew a taped confession would make the case a slam dunk.
I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it because they're so far from the case, they don't care about it at all.
Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down about this Briggs thing, and that kind of bums me out, so I got you this Cookie Puss.
Joe, your 25-year-old son and your baby daughter share a room just so you can keep a weirdo Beautiful Mind room?
And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls so they couldn't be traced back to us.
And so I say unto you, sons of liberty, no longer will free men live under the yoke of giant predatory birds.
You keep so busy with your kids, time just seems to slip away, and then you turn around one day and...
You know, Peter, I know Lois is downplaying it, but I think she might actually appreciate it if we threw her a party.
You know, she's got like a cute tomboy thing where you feel like you could play softball with her, and then later on, give her the old sau-seege.
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. All right, you guys, that was Lois. She's gonna be here in ten minutes.
What were once pink and succulent rose petals now take the form of the shredded, raggedy, blown-out endpiece of a practical joker's exploding cigar.
Lois, you may not be the young filly you were when I met you, but you're still my reliable old plow horse who's there each day to pull the plow, to help around the barn, and let the husband horse-slap a batch at her now and then.
And I have a lovely gift of the batchslapping variety waiting for you when I'm just the right amount of drunk.
Okay, now, I'm an excellent night nurse, so you two get some much-deserved sleep and don't worry about a thing.
I can only imagine Madeline would say, Take me out of this disgusting French hospital and find me some real parents.
So if you don't want to run with the wild horses, then go back to the barn and go to bed.
The city of Quahog has been stricken with a case of Bieber Fever tonight, as teen idol and fake black guy Justin Bieber is in town for a sold-out show at the Quahog Civic Center.
I mean, every guy who's been married a while thinks he wants a hot, young chick, but after you spend an hour with one of them, you want to blow your brains out.
She's taped photographs of Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry on the inside cover, as if she's some sort of hip hybrid of those two things.
Hey, look at this. Kent is so incredibly sexy. He said 'hi' to me today, and I almost died. Also, I learned a funny lesson today in my pursuit of Kent: anal bleaching is better left to professionals. LOL.
Meg, are you asking, in this day and age, when the CEO of Xerox is a woman, when the president of Brazil is a woman, even Rosie O'Donnell is a woman, whether it's appropriate for a girl to ask a boy out on a date?
I'm sorry, Meg. I think you're great, and I love hanging out with you, but there's something you should know.
Yeah, I know, but I asked someone to do me a favor, and they're not too keen on doing it.
It's just that he's not as comfortable with his sexuality as you are yet, so he's gonna need to pretend to be asleep while it's happening.
I know you've been having a hard time lately, so I wanted to give you something that means a lot to me.
You taught me how to hunt squirrels with poisoned cheese, and then you took me to the hospital when the squirrels tricked me into eating the cheese.
At Northwest Airlines, thousands of employees are dedicated to delaying and cancelling flights so you won't get home for the holidays.
Many years ago there was a hardworking young carpenter named Joseph, and one day, Joseph and his friend Robby were hanging...
Not just because Mary was a virgin, but because baseball would not be invented for 1,800 years and nobody knew what the hell he was talking about.
It was back when they were like, Drown all the girls, and then they were like, Don't drown all the girls, but she was born on a drowning week, so, you know.
I'll come by around that part of the day when the sun goes away and we're all terrified it will never come back.
I hear an oracle from Greece is sending a funny message and I want to be there when it arrives.
I's been sent to bring you the message that tonight you's gonna be getting pregnant with the Son of God.
Oh, and he probably don't want me to tell you this, but be ready 'cause he might give you a little bit of a donkey punch.
And as Mary and Joseph made their way to Bethlehem, three wise men were preparing for a journey of their own.
Hey, you guys, this says a King of Kings will be born in Bethlehem, and we are to go and pay tribute.
Cleveland's got a cousin who had eight girlfriends get pregnant, and he says he's not responsible for a single one.
Also, I'm gonna start dieting and working out so I'm like crazy lean for the, you know, for, for, for the thing.
Okay, Mrs. Donovan. Following Mrs. Donovan by Chris Griffin. The first thing that Mrs. Donovan does when she gets home from school is put on sweatpants. Then she eats a whole tube of cookie dough, but she must be allergic to it because there are tears coming out of her eyes and she always throws up right after. Then she puts paper doll clothes on a picture of a sonogram.
Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I called you in today because your son, Chris, has been getting in quite a bit of trouble lately.
I mean, when Chris grows up, will he even be able to get a job or take care of himself?
Oh, by the way, there's a baby in my preschool with HIV, and my teacher gave you something to sign to get him kicked out.
Well, we always keep one spacecraft flight-ready in the event a satellite needs service, there's a space station emergency or an Italian guy needs to overexaggerate.
Oh, and hey, if you get sent off on a space mission, um, don't be the black guy, 'cause you'll die.
If you all saw Apollo 13, you know they had to fix an air scrubber with just the tools in the capsule.
Listen, just so there are no surprises, don't be scared-- my stuff looks like someone spilled an apple pie in my lap.
Look at this, Lois. a week ago, we call him stupid, and now he's giving tours of the space shuttle.
Well, I don't know what most of these buttons do, but I know this big red one is the one you press to launch.
I know you all must be pretty terrified right now, but we're doing everything in our power to get you safely back to earth.
All right, come on, if mission control thought we could help get the shuttle out of orbit, it can't be that hard.
Well, thanks to no gravity in space, my spine stretched and I am now a confident six, three, so, Lois, I will be leaving you for a hotter woman.
Oh, here it is. Here's hoping A Passing Fancy is actually a staying fancy. The highest praise goes to playwright Brian Griffin for his hilarious and insightful look into modern relationships. If you see only one play as an adult,
Mr. Beaker, it is my unfortunate task to inform you that your services will no longer be required by this company.
Well, if you must know, it's because we've noticed large quantities of benzene, ephedrine and everyday Epsom salt have gone missing.
May every person that laughs at your sophomoric effort be a reminder of your eternal mediocrity and pierce your heart like a knife.
Listen, I just want to say what an inspiration Glengarry Glen Ross was to me when I was writing my own play.
Boy, it's just so weird to be in a room where every single person in the room is a playwright.
I was fine being an okay writer, until I discovered I was living in a house with a brilliant one.
I know we don't talk about doggy years a lot, but I-I just wish you could have waited to find out how talented you were until I was gone.
Hey, sometimes when daddies drive home drunk, they come from far away places, but it's okay because they didn't get arrested and they're still kind of drunk so they-they think it's okay.
I've learned the difference between true love and doing the entire bowling team of a pizza restaurant on a box spring by a brook.
Let her suck it up-- she's the expert. Sorry, keep going. ...and at least try to make things work with Charmese.
But I was thinking, maybe this afternoon you'd like to borrow my credit card and buy yourself a new wardrobe.
I was gonna make you breakfast maybe once a week, and give you stuff to do right when you walk through the door after work.
The Borioles now lace a fong toad rip where they'll face the Sed Rox, the Revil Days and the Jue Blays.
I would never ask you to do this if I had any other choice and if what were at stake was anything less than my entire way of life.
Charmese won't give me a divorce because she doesn't believe I'm gay, so I need you to have sex with me while she watches.
I see that now, and the truth is, if you're willing to go this far to get a divorce, then maybe we shouldn't be married after all.
You were real nice to me, Glenn, nicer than any other guy's been, but I wanted to be somebody's wife, not somebody's burden.
Hey, you know, there's not too many guys in the world who would be willing to do something like that for their pal.
I thought why not go back in time to that summer of love in the '60s that everyone's always talking about.
Oh, hey, um, I just came to say, um... you know, in a couple of years something's going to come along called Sesame Street.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Despite our best efforts, the Texas School Book Depository Awareness Council has failed in its mission to generate public awareness of the Texas School Book Depository.
Look, I've been thinking about your situation with women, and I believe I've come up with a way to get to the source of the problem. Follow me.
And now I want you to go and take a picture of yourself because it will be your last day alone.
This must be what it's like for you when you're buying potatoes or scraping your heels or smushing on makeup for a sad night out.
At the end, when Richard Gere carries Debra Winger out of the paper mill, you have to read what's on this index card.
Okay, Chris, I want to wear contacts, but I'm too squeamish to put them in myself, so you need to help me.
Well, I suppose it's about trying new things; sampling the sweet and the savory; not being afraid to take everything life wants to throw up on into ya.
But then you oil it up, work your fingers around in there a little, and pretty soon you're pitching and catching.
Yeah, the woman in the song is trying to cope with getting older and she feels trapped because she knows she can't do anything about it.
And then, to make things worse, the snowbird comes around every year, bringing the snow, or death, to remind her that no matter what she does, her fate's already written.
I am not going to cook you dinner while you sit here in your own mess playing your TV games.
Maybe we can get the birds to act out the Benson where a scheduling snafu forces the governor to decide between meeting the president or going to Katie's school play!
Peter, I've had a long day at work, and right now, sex is the last thing I want to think about.
Listen, um, I've had such a good time talking to you these past few times that I was thinking maybe we could meet.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm meeting Fairy God Quagmire and Fairy God Joe down at the Fairy God Clam.
You-you-you-you is the phone lady, you the phone, you the phone, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady, you is the phone lady...
The wieners was already drawed in the books when I got 'em. Libra: A strange man will drop into your life. Hmm. Pisces: Be careful at work today.
It's like they say, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, and gay guys gotta criticize the host of the party behind his back.
But if you'll excuse me, right now I have to go bring great shame to myself by using the restroom.
Yeah, and he's got his cell phone clipped to his belt like he's some kind of big shot on vacation.
I mean, who doesn't want to sit around a table with a bunch of guys and suck on the same thing?
Well, Lois, I happen to be a Muslim now, which means I'll be spending a lot of my time in mostly-empty cafes, watching soccer on an eight-inch black-and-white TV.
Well, if you're going to the market, can you pick up some cereal, some butter, and a loaf of bread?
So, Mike, now that you've thoroughly kicked my butt all over the court, what do you say we take one quick second to talk about the Wichita account?
And let me assure you, my racquetball game is no indication of how we do business here at J.T. Stern.
Listen, Peter, some friends of mine and I are getting together tonight and we wanted to invite you to join us.
We have the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, and even that fat guy at the Atlanta Olympics who didn't do it, but he looked mean, so we said he did.
If you can find out what they're planning next, we might actually be able to stop an act of terror.
Remember how upset I seemed to get when Lois said she was leaving town with the kids for a few days?
Remember, we'll be in the van listening to everything, so if anything goes wrong, we'll pull you right out of there.
In order to get past the checkpoint at the toll plaza, we will need an American behind the wheel to arouse the least amount of suspicion.
We're the proud nation where someone can shoot up their entire workplace with a thing, and then the next day nobody talks about banning that thing.
Police say the victim was killed by a knife belonging to the mayor, who is considered the prime suspect at this time.
Also found in the mayor's residence was a blackmail note from the victim threatening to expose the mayor in a corruption scandal unless the victim was paid off.
Tom, I'm standing outside the mayor's mansion, where, against the wishes of his attorneys, the mayor has agreed to an impromptu press conference.
I always knew Mayor West was a little crazy, but I never thought he was capable of something like this.
Brian, all I have to do is start fake sneezing around you and you'll spend the rest of your life outside.
I remind you that because we are a small town, many of you may have ties with the defendant or the victim.
So I's been asked by the judge to be the foreman, and I want y'all to know that we's gonna run a fair jury and a clean jury, so I brought some wet naps for everyone to wipe off their areas.
Look, I know everyone's in a hurry, but shouldn't we at least go over the evidence once before we vote, just to be fair?
How do you know? Because I once got a note from the Marriott written on the same paper. Dear Brian. You were amazing last night.
I did a dog once, but I was in the Philippines, and I sure as hell didn't write him a letter.
The victim had access to all the Office of the Mayor stationery he could ever want, yet he hand-made a letterhead on stationery from a Marriott?
Okay, look, tempers are starting to get a little heated, so why don't we all go take us a little potty break?
Trust me, you're banging eight strangers who responded to a flyer, at some point you're gonna look out a window and question every decision you've ever made.
Yeah, let's wrap this up-- I got the director's cut of Raiders of the Lost Ark waiting for me at home.
And all I wanted was to fire a missile into a fault line to sink half of Quahog into the ocean and make my real estate waterfront.
Yeah, I mean, it was a pretty intense experience, but the important thing is, in the end, justice was served.
In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that a Canadian strip club is the most magical place in the world.
We now return to Stabbed in the Butt, the only game show where if you get the answer wrong, you get stabbed in the butt.
Okay, I know you're a pilot and everything, but not everyone likes to talk about planes as much as you, Quagmire.
Listen, why don't we head back to my place, grab a bite to eat and watch the big curling match on TV?
If you're listening to this, you've probably become feral, and you're probably thinking of a nice juicy rabbit right now.
All right, now, I've been trying to figure out something we can do together, and I think I've found it.
Peter, we all love you very much, but we think maybe this is where you belong and where you'll be happy.
But today's breaking news is that the New England Toy and Game Company has issued an immediate recall of all of its stuffed bears, like the one shown here.
Fletcher met the long arm of the law at the wrong end of a shotgun and the deep end of a grave at the far end of a dead-end road.
This is the first day we're allowed to the end of the driveway, and I intend to take full advantage.
My white blood cells attacked the pathogens and created antibodies, and then the pathogens were filtered out by my kidneys into my urine and then expelled from my body, you slut.
You owe me from when I took you to see Shakespeare in the Park, even though it was the part of the park where the gay guys go to have sex.
Also, I get the sense that Kristen Stewart is more of a bath person when she really needs a shower.
This tour will take us deep into the factory, and when the time is right, we'll slip away and find Rupert.
Every once in a while, one of our toys becomes real, and we have to make sure it doesn't get out.
I mean, it's nice to make new friends, but not if it means losing the best friend I've ever had.
Plus, I'm planning on having my period really hard later, and I want to be in the tub when it happens.
Now remember, we're here to impress the girlfriends of guys we barely know, so when you get the ball, throw it like a cannon.
Yes, you must leave them behind, and they must be in a crumbly mess so that the city clean-up workers have to chase the little bits when the wind blows.
I'd just like to say that... before today, I didn't know the Munsters were driving around in a funeral car.
And so let us take a look back on his life through this video commemorating all the DUI's that he was responsible for.
I mean, as long as we got a place to drink and a restroom for businessmen to have homosexual encounters.
Yeah, and don't you think it's confusing that every character in the movie is named Movie Guy? Come on, you guys.
What are we doing at the Clam? Look, guys, we tried other bars, we tried drinking at home, we even tried the big end-of-the-year high school party that will change everything.
Quagmire, when a girl says she doesn't want to have sex with you, do you take that as an answer?
Hey, uh, remember... remember-remember when... remember when... remember when Quicktime here passed out in this... in this booth... this booth, and we did stuff to him that you do to ladies and we-we promised we'd never tell you.
It's where the three of us made that suicide pact that Quagmire and I are gonna back out of at the last minute.
Peter, you get out here right now, or else I'm throwing away all of your Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.
My husband had filled out an organ donor card before he passed away, and a woman just lost her face in a freak accident.
Well, I hate to admit it, Lois, but over the last couple of years, this town has changed a lot, a not necessarily for the better.
You know, it's hard for me to take the things you say seriously when I know what's been in that mouth of yours.
We finally went to a restaurant without somebody yelling at us, and then the rest of the place applauding them.
I mean, all I ever wanted was to raise our children in a wholesome place, far away from all the crime and problems of the big city.
Lois, you were saying yourself how you want our kids to grow up in a wholesome place away from the big city.
And, Chris, you been telling me how you wanted to watch animals humping other animals what might not be okay with it.
A farm with big open fields, Brian, where you can just run and run and be free and no one will ever hurt you.
Look, I know it seems like dirty work, but, Chris, you got to spread that seed until your sack is empty.
And, Meg, you got to clear away all that brush so he can plant it deep where it needs to be.
Part of being a farmer is having a best friend named Larry who I spend huge amounts of time with, but never actually talk to.
And meanwhile, you're spending half our money down at the General Store, and the other half at the Specific Store.
And is it true that you've been spending the farm's money on gingham shirts you tie into a knot to expose your belly?
Well, with all this debt and no income, there's no way we're gonna be able to keep up our bank payments.
And so, as I look out at your smiling faces filled with hope, all I can think is, you are completely screwed.
Now, I know you're freaked out, but when you really stop and think about it, this meth lab is our family's best chance to make meth in a lab.
Our top story: Methamphetamine is flooding into Quahog in epidemic amounts, and is believed to be originating from the nearby rural community of Farmton.
And second, no one's gonna leave a place where there are tons of beakers for a place where there are zero beakers.
Well, listen up, everybody, 'cause it's time for our grand prize drawing for those tickets to see Celine Dion live in Las Vegas!
We now return to Franklin and Bash with Indicators to Show Which One is Franklin and Which One is Bash.
Hey, Stewie, I don't know if you have any interest in this, but I was wondering if you want to go to Vegas with me and see Celine Dion.
Well, you see, I recently completed construction on a teleportation device, and it occurred to me, this may be the perfect chance to try it out.
Take your Juicy sweatpants and your dirty pillow from home, and your bucket of Coke, and get the hell out of my sight.
Plus, the air is clean because they suck up all the cigarette smoke and dump it in the bad hotels.
You know, I know we're switching to a digital world, but I-I think this little guy's still got a place in it.
Do you know what it's like to go to the doctor and see your own foot in the garbage can?
Well, I was on my way to get ice cream and I passed a roulette table, and I put it all on 16 because of that Taylor Swift song, Sixteen.
And-and you are gonna laugh about this, if I know your dark sense of humor, but I may have gambled away our plane tickets.
Honestly, I'm trying to sell my condo, and I need people to come to the open house and talk about how nice it is.
Well, I wasn't gonna tell you till later, but I actually used part of my portion to take care of some personal business.
Don't worry; I'll get that money back no matter what, and for sure I'm not gonna stop first and get some crepes in the lobby.
You bastards think you can just borrow a bunch of money from a loan shark and then waste it on tacky suits?
Sir, we can't give you any money, but if you've got some milk and a bowl, we can give you a pretty healthy way to start your day.
We have no money, no way to get home, and one of the loan shark's goons is probably gonna bust through that door any minute and kill us both.
I mean, I'm just gonna end up like Chris, only I'll be smart enough to realize how miserable I am.
And you've only got a few good years left anyway, and that's if we even get out of here alive.
You know, the only thing that was holding me back even a little is knowing how much Lois is gonna milk this.
Everyone, I truly want to thank you for your support and remind you that, as far as casseroles go, we're good on pasta, but we could use some more dessert items.
The machine must have created two pairs of us-- one that was teleported to Las Vegas and the other that wasn't.
Oh, well, th-these thugs came to shoot you, and I tried to throw myself in front of the bullet, but it must have gone, like, under my armpit or something
People keep coming back every hour because they think it's a regular show, like-like the volcano or the pirate ship thing.
Yeah, look, I'm guessing there's some kind of soccer match from your home country going on, and I get that, I do.
But, uh, some of us are trying to sleep, and I could almost deal with the noise, but it's the cologne, all right?
Okay, so I know you're a harmonica, but right now you're a 40-year-old woman with a good body in a hotel pool.
I am gonna make this family proud, and not just you guys, but that old painting of my ancestor in the attic.
I got tired of not being able to find my bags, so I tied a vaguely Hanna-Barbera-looking character to it.
Now, look, Peter, j-just because you're a member now and I'm your guest, that doesn't mean things are gonna change between us, right?
I got a big-ass coat, chair to sit in, chalice cup of wine and a midget, but I ain't going out there with all them monsters out there!
Look, Peter, I'm sorry for the way I treated you, but is there anything you can do to get me back in the club?
I mean, it's just human nature to suck up to the people above you, crap on those beneath you and undercut your equals.
Well, then we just got to figure out a way to make you fancier than Barrington, so he's got to suck up to you.
I thought you were just some suck-up loser, but you have shown me that you've got the mettle to be one of us.
Ah, yes. You see, legend has it that Quahog founder Miles Chatterbox Musket hid his fortune in fear of it being taken by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War.
I'm talking about the fact that our son, who you insisted we name after that guy Marty, looks exactly like him!
You think I'm an idiot? That I wouldn't notice that our son is a dead ringer for the guy who fixed us up?
Well, it's not the treasure, but it looks like it's a clue to where the treasure is. Face the circle in the square, you'll see me, I'll show you where.
Hello, I'm Tom Tucker, here with local fortune seeker Peter Griffin, who appears to have found a clue to a hidden treasure.
That's right, Tom, and I sincerely hope that the caption beneath me doesn't say Local Fatty. Let's do something about that caption.
I don't know nothin'. Everyone doubted me, so I wanted to rub it in their faces that I was right.
Look, you guys doubted me, mocked me, constantly handled my Eggo despite my clear instructions, and now you want a piece of my treasure?
Look-- there's a plaque! This square shall forever honor the memory of my son, Timmy Musket. Always a chip off the old Block. May he rest in peace.
I mean, last time we came into some money, he just wasted it on all those diamond pinkie rings for everybody.
Yes, I mean, he's the guy who put all those little bald men in incubators because he thought they were babies.
So, you walk into a store, you see the hundreds of options for candy, and you choose a Mounds bar?
You know, Peter, in the first eight minutes of Meg's play, before I walked out, they said Miles Musket was a horrible drunk and a wife beater.
And cheers and boos might be referring to a bar where he would cheers, and drink his booze. Hits missus, cheers and booze.
Here, hold this. Congratulations. You have won The Founding Father Restaurant Treasure Hunt Challenge. Please enjoy one free meal at select Founding Father locations.
Okay, Lois, I'll be right here, standing uncomfortably close to the unnecessary piano player in the middle of the mall.
There aren't enough verses in any song I could write that would express how much hatred I have in my heart.
Well, it's an incomplete twin that never developed into a fully-formed person but still exists as a growth feeding off your body.
I like to poke him 'cause it makes him happy, and I feel it a little bit in my nads.
You know, Lois, a lot of times you go into someone's house, and it's just a house, but you can tell this is a home by all the love here.
So, uh, you know, Chip, now that you're a free man, this is a chance for you to go out and make a real life for yourself someplace.
What's so great about him? Well, to be honest, the same thing that used to be so great about you.
I-I'm just nervous that somebody else is gonna get pictures of their cat on the Internet first, and then I'll always be known as the second guy to get pictures of his cat on the Internet.
Yes, well, you know I turn to poetry when matters of the heart weigh heavily on me. If you're happy and you know it, then your face will surely show it. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands.
Excuse me. I bought this laptop here yesterday, but when I got home I noticed the apple already had a bite taken out of it!
Well, I've always had this fantasy of having sex on the basketball court in front of my high school principal.
Okay, Glenn, now that we've covered ourselves in black ink, let's do it until we've created every character in the Chinese alphabet.
Glenn, remember, the thing we love most about each other is that we push each other way beyond our normal boundaries.
I know you just got back from Vietnam and you love me, but I'm gonna go run a train with this group of Black Panthers I just met.
I know you came all this way to New York to visit me, but I'm gonna go do blow and have sex with a bunch of stockbrokers.
So, why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away.
Right, and if we can't find him in here, he sometimes likes to hang out in between the blades of grass in my lawn.
Oh, I thought he might have been talking about this super kinky woman who's always down here, trying to lure men to her sex slave shed.
The time we met The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, that winter we lived on the sun, and here's my favorite.
I can't believe the guy with the ponytail and the facial tattoo at the front desk would let this happen.
I been reading this novel about three guys, happen to be pigs, uh, that decide to build their own houses.
We now return to the Kentucky Derby, where 90% of the audience roots for the horse with the cutest name.
Well, I heard about how Peter's making you see him naked lately, so I thought the only way to get even is for you to see me naked.
Also, Zack Morris, if you could stop freezing time to talk to the camera, the day would go a lot faster.
Meg, we've been over this. Just because a Facebook page has over 2,000 likes doesn't mean you have to kill yourself.
That sex tape I released should be everywhere by now, and then they'll have to kick me out of the school.
It's one thing if you put your penis inside-out in the safety of your own bedroom, but to have it done in the cafeteria...
All right, Meg, the best way for you to focus your rage is if I wear the mask of the person who's bullied you every day of your life.
Our top story: price wars are heating up between all of the major airlines and even a couple of the little crashy ones.
Tom, I'm standing here at Boston's Logan Airport, where some of the same security people who let the terrorists on the plane are still gainfully employed.
Well, if I must accept your proposal in order to break the entail and save my family's estate, then yes, I will marry you.
Hmm, well, pardon my skepticism, Lois, but I didn't read about this in the latest issue of Water Park Enthusiast Weekly.
Okay, everyone, put the sunblock on now, so when we get off the plane, we go right to the park.
I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the seatbelt sign, so you idiots can all stretch and let the fart festival begin.
Peter, the kids are going to the Italian circus, so I thought it might be romantic if we watched the sunset from St. Peter's Basilica.
I can't believe it's too much for you to watch a sunset with your wife in one of the most romantic cities in the world!
Well, what do you expect, Lois? I didn't want to come here he first place. I'd rather be back home.
Now, look, buddy, there's a million ways to lose a gal, but there's only one sure way to get her back.
Peter, I know you love it here, but riding your bike around town isn't paying the bills, and the kids aren't learning anything at that Italian school.
All right, now that you've completed your initial application, it will need to be filed by an immigration lawyer at a cost of approximately $5,000 per person.
But I'm afraid our only hope is that perhaps the alternate Stewie in this universe has created his own time machine that we can use.
Hey, shot in the dark, but, uh, is anyone else in the mood to run really fast in one direction?
I time-traveled ahead to Christmas so I wouldn't have to wait all year for the new toys to come out.
I don't know how much longer he has, but I suggest that you all go in and say your good-byes.
Oh, boy, this is, um... this is probably the worst pain I've ever had to go through, and I've sprained my ankle twice.
He was smart, he was loyal, and I guess what I'm trying to say is he was like a brother to me.
You know, I hate to say it, but I-I'm starting to think the only way to stop missing Brian is to get a new dog.
I know it might take time to find the right dog, but I really feel like it might be the best way for us to move on.
Look, I miss Brian more than any of you, but at least now no one's forcing us to watch those awful PBS documentaries.
That was beautiful. And it must be original, because I know every song about money, and I've never heard that one before.
Hey, do I have time to get a drink at the water fountain where the water does not crest above the dispenser?
If you randomly stumble upon an amazing talent, and then someone important sees it by wild coincidence, great things can happen without any hard work.
Anyway, a bunch of us got together and beat him with a grill lid and windshield wipers, and let's just say, uh, he don't do chick stuff no more.
I don't know. Soon thereafter, a girl in the neighborhood married a black guy, so we all kind of turned our attention to that.
You know, the best thing about the Quahog Mall is going into Tiffany's and doing everything possible to make 'em think I might actually buy something.
Oh, and these watches here, if I wanted to get 11 of them for different groomsmen, could they each get engraved individually?
Turns out I know a guy who knows a guy who knows another guy who knows a girl, which is weird because they don't usually know nothin', who says the carnival was canceled by the mall's owner, some guy named Carter Pewterschmidt.
That's right, and this is my own People magazine from home and not from your waiting room just now, and why did you cancel the Christmas Carnival?
You know, I know I'm usually all business, but deep down, you know what the thing is that keeps me going more than anything else?
And keep in mind, it's traditional to embellish a little bit to make yourself look better. Peter had a great year, and is now starting quarterback for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Yeah, who has the time? Keep reading. Chris refurbished a vintage motorcycle, and Stewie can slam-dunk a basketball from a standing start...
Now, everyone knows the best way to get the Christmas spirit is to drink a whole lot of thick, frothy eggnog.
Okay, Carter, a big part of Christmas is masturbating like you would any other day but feeling guilty about it because it's Christmas.
You're next up to see the big guy himself and you look like a piece of spaghetti on the street.
I don't know. I thought having the carnival back would make me happy, but it still feels like something's missing.
Yup. Let me read you an expert. You wish you were a millionaire. You want more money. Guess what. You blew it. You wish you could change the neighborhood. You want to be a selectman. You blew it. You wish you could open up a restaurant. You did not want to pay protection money. Knock, knock. Who's there?
Look, I appreciate all this, Vinny, but there's only one Brian, and it's tough for me that he's gone, especially around the holidays.
To the beach, a wedding on the beach, beach graduation, beach funeral, business conference which could be at a beach, a stroll through the park, should that park be adjacent to a beach.
What kid wouldn't want to play with these? Baa. What are you lookin' at? Not much, that's what I'm lookin' at. You want to have a go? I'd watch what I say with that other sheep right behind you.
Excellent. Now all I've got to do is set the coordinates to the moment before Brian got killed and I can save him.
Yes, but luckily, I ran into another me from the past, so I stole his return pad and came back here.
Are you-- and please say yes-- are you related-- and even if you're not, please say yes-- are you related to-- and please say yes because I need the attention from my friends-- are you related to Def Leppard?
Well, that and I can work on my verbal sound effects and not feel self-conscious about the ones that aren't quite there yet.
Yeah, Frank retired, and since you're already required to wear a helmet here-- which, by the way, put on your helmet.
You know, I always thought I could chug that, but I never tried 'cause I figured I couldn't lift it.
Now, I know it's picture day, but we can't afford them anymore, so just run behind another kid when they're getting their picture taken.
You know, actually, Peter, there's a lot of job training programs sponsored by the state that could help you get the skills you need for another occupation.
I don't know, I just thought it would be cool to decide which kids do and don't get hit by a car.
No, Peter, if I'm gonna be out of the house working, you're gonna have to take over for me in the house.
No, I mean, you're gonna need to cook the meals and do laundry and take care of Stewie, like I've been doing.
Well, look at it this way, Peter: without sex, you'll have more time to do the things you've always wanted to do.
Nice try, but I'm not the one who drove a forklift into a conference room and sent two people to the hospital.
And I could stand here and give you a big speech about second chances and promise to work harder than ever before.
And I could remind you that one day you might be in my shoes and maybe you'll need a second chance.
I'm gonna cash in this coupon you gave me last Valentine's Day. One Redo For Being Fired For Gross Negligence. And One Hug.
Those three guys broke in, beat up the father with a croquet mallet, and then stole the baby, and nobody knows where the baby is now?
Look, le-let's just admit we both kind of got our wires crossed, and commit to being clearer in the future.
I knew you'd be mad, so I've asked the band Heart to explain these beans in a way you can dreamily digest.
I-I was hoping they'd change a few more words to pertain to our situation, but I-I-I'm just happy they did this.
So I got out of the car to take a leak, because I'd been drinking, and I didn't know it was next to a children's park.
Well, she was my ex-girlfriend, and I believed I was due an explanation about why she was such a  whore.
A long time ago, in a magical, faraway land, several women lived together and, surprise, surprise, they didn't exactly get along.
He skipped the, uh, south side of town, which, uh, even in fairy tale times, was, um... let's just say loud.
And they lived happily ever after for seven months and then separated with the goal of fixing themselves and getting back together.
I mean, wouldn't it be awesome if-if they were all grouped together, like in a cafeteria, and you could just go in there with a trench coat and just waste them?
A writer who inherits a magic typewriter that writes for him, but then it turns out the typewriter is... racist?
And I haven't seen him in years, and at this point, I-I just don't see what could possibly be gained from me getting together with him.
In entertainment news, Hollywood comes to Quahog in the form of a new Disney Channel show called Parent Boppers, about a group of teen detectives.
It's-it's almost like the universe is trying to I don't know, make us work together or something, I don't know.
Hold on, other kids. Maybe they just recognize that nothing can protect us from the tedium of our mundane lives.
It's-it's like Dylan just held a mirror up to me, and I could finally see how poorly I'd been treating him.
I guess I didn't realize how lucky I was to have Dylan back in my life until I lost him all over again.
Well, okay, but that means you're in charge of getting Mr. Devlin to admit that after 30 years, he still loves Mrs. Devlin very much.
Listen, Tevin, I think I just need more time to focus on my snowboarding and Web series about energy drinks.
It's like you held a mirror up to him and he could finally see how poorly he'd been treating you.
Stay on me, camera one. ...to have you back in his life, and now he feels like he's lost you all over again.
No, no, I was supposed to offer, and then you were supposed to say, No, Peter, I'm not gonna shoot you, although I do appreciate the gesture.
All right, well, I'm gonna go confuse everyone on Facebook with a, So sad, terrible day status and nothing more.
My mother always hoped to be buried with her pet cat, Mittens, so I'd like to thank the Quahog Veterinary Society for putting Mittens down so quickly.
Yeah... a-and maybe she can be my new mom, you know, just like Greg Evigan and Paul Reiser were briefly my two dads.
See, these guys believe that after you die, you're reincarnated and you come back as a pig or a cow or a rooster.
But they also don't believe in demonstrating emotions either way, so they're the worst people to buy birthday gifts for.
Peter, thank you so much for your help in making this cake, but don't you think it would be easier if you stood on the floor?
Well, I just think it's pretty clear that we're all just bags of bones and flesh that eventually break down and decay into worm food.
No, Evelyn, I trusted you, and all this funny business keeps happening, and I don't think it's your medicine at all.
Nobody knows what comes next, so all we can do is pack the most we can into each day we've got.
You know, ever since you turned into a rock with your name on it, your friend's been really inappropriate with me.
It's just that since my beloved Walter died, you're the first man who's paid any attention to me, and I guess I took advantage of that.
Okay, my Great-Uncle-wears a-ski-hat-all-the-time Griffin will be followed by Nick Nolte's handkerchief, followed by Japanese Abe Lincoln, and then monkey rabbi.
With a five-point lead and only ten seconds left, all the Patriots have to do is kneel down with the ball, and the game is... Oh, my God, it's a fumble!
John Wayne only ate beef and coffee for every meal, so the director had to shoot around the fact that he was on the toilet all the time.
I'd like to thank God and a jury of my peers, who are both responsible for me being able to play today.
It's time someone told God to stay where He belongs-- in our schools, and-and telling people where they can stick their wieners.
Well, it's absurd to think that my hand scratching on the couch is some kind of animal, but you do.
Okay, this is God's house, so we'll just go in there, talk to Him, and take care of this whole thing.
Hey, in that song, Jesus, Take the Wheel, was that, like, the real Jesus, or was it just some Mexican guy?
All right, look, maybe I'm not like other football fans, but I don't have a fulfilling career and a rich family life.
I don't know where they're getting all this weed. In Greece, it was commonly held that one could speak to the gods from the top of Mount Olympus.
All right, what better place to find God than the birthplace of all of Western civilization's great religions and one really mean one.
All right, Coach, now one thing that's always funny is when I dub my voice over animal footage and introduce human foibles into their situations.
Our friend Joe here has to have his fluids changed every 72 hours, or else he swells up and his eyes turn yellow.
Last week, the handicapped seat on the bus was taken, so they put me on the front, like a bicycle.
All right, we got to put toilets in these things if we're gonna be in 'em for more than two hours.
But, Peter, I still don't understand why you would go to all that trouble to find God and only ask about the Patriots.
Cause there's a three-day weekend coming up and I thought maybe you and I can finally go fishing like we've been talking about.
Actually, Mom can't take care of him, she's out of town doing a photo shoot for the cover of Veins Magazine.
I can't go. I've got to go get my hair very minutely changed and then spend the next 14 hours trying to get people to notice.
Listen, Chris, I really want to thank you for coming to take care of me and helping me get well again.
Oh, it was no big deal. Well, it is to me, and I want to give you some money for all your time.
Look, Carter, I suppose you're entitled to do what you want, but, you know, I'm just saying, if it were me,
Look, I never told you this, but... for years now, I've been planning on retiring at 45 so I can work on finding a cure for Ballzheimers disease.
Hey, hey, Chris, how about you and me do a secret handshake that has way too many steps to remember, all right?
Okay. Shake, bump, bump, slap, pinky hook, pretend to slick your hair back, represent, bump, one spin, slap high, slap low, reverse spin, bump, explode, shake, belly rub, fake yawn, finger gun, hitchhiker, hitchhiker, shimmy shimmy sham sham, shake, shake, shake, bump, something smells and shake again.
MAN (on TV): We now return to the director's cut of Mission: Impossible 5, with the step stools not edited out.
I'm just gonna take my VCR, my VCR head-cleaning tape, my VCR head-cleaning spray, my head-cleaning rag, and my rewinder, and just get the hell out of here.
Well, it got off to a great start, but when it was my turn to play Words With Friends, it really took me out of it.
Chris, there comes a time when every man looks at his son and thinks, I want to take this to the next level.
When you're married, you get to spend all your time together, doing things like playing catch and going fishing, right?
Yeah, um, I'd like to furnish my kitchen as if I'm the greatest chef in the world, even though I've never cooked before.
Absolutely. Can I put them near the couple that hooked up drunk and now have to make awkward small talk until their cab to the airport arrives?
Um, even though we only met them three months ago, but we would like them to be prominently featured to let the other guests know how tolerant and wonderful we are.
You know, I've given it a lot of thought, and I went with the most romantic song ever, Stars And Stripes Forever by John Philip Sousa.
For a man to marry his son in a state with enough trees around that nobody can see what's going on.
Now, I ain't no scholar, but if that's not a metaphor for major-league butt stuff, I don't know what is.
Yeah, and I guess I learned it's wrong to take your son to Vermont under false pretenses to try to marry him for his inheritance.
Wait, so you mean to tell me, if I ever want to get out of something, all I got to do is take a smoke break?
You put them in there, and they swim like hell for, like, 30 seconds, and then they go to sleep.
I know it's technically not illegal, but it seemed wrong when your music teacher wrapped a trash bag around his waist so he could change pants.
Well, you know, at first it was a way to get out of work, but then I discovered it's a delightful habit that has lots of benefits. Yeah? Like what?
Oh, hey, uh, you know, I don't know if you're the guy to talk to about this, but when I went to my trailer this morning, there was a hairy naked guy in it.
Yeah, Lois is right. As bad as you look, the damage you've done to your heart and your lungs is, no doubt, exponentially worse. What?!
He, like, threw me down and he said, I hope your puppeteer has big hands, because I'm not using lube.
You know, Lois, physicists believe there are two alternate universes: one in which I don't open the box and one in which I do.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up that Peter has a whip, because, well, you know, given your racial heritage, it seems like something you might want to keep an eye out for.
All right, bitches, either you tuck your little wangs between your legs and waddle out of here or we're gonna beat the crap out of you.
So, I was thinking, I know they're kind of overused lately... but your colors should be, like, yellow and gray.
I heard about what happened at the Clam, and I'm not interested in having sex with a quarter of a man.
And these two barbecue scumbags formed a lifelong friendship until their deaths at the ripe old age of 52 in separate ATV accidents.
I want to go on a date with Neve Campbell so I can give her a nice ladle of Stew.
Now, you'll be watching Stewie, and I don't want you just to prop him up next to the TV all day.
Peter, they threw what I thought was a bucket of water on me, but it turns out, it was just a bunch of confetti!
The doctor says it's as if our breasts have been X-rayed five hours a day, every day, for the last three years!
I got to wonder-- I'm sure you do, too-- how this thing didn't crack when they were carving out her downstairs business.
This is our new bookshelf, and I think you'll find it has more channels than any TV we've ever owned.
Well, Lois, some of it came from books, some came from museums, and, honestly, a lot of it just came from travel.
All right, if this is to be a smart family, we will have to learn not to giggle at smart things that sound dirty but are not.
And tonight is the night I meet with other members of my form twelve learning mates to celebrate the exactly two groupings of ten years ago.
Oh, that should be easy. Just give me the word, and I'll put it in a sentence for you. Anodyne.
If visiting San Francisco and New York made Peter smart, maybe if we send him to the dumbest city in the whole country, it'll bring back the old Peter.
And then happy birthday is all blurry, because whoever opens the card is 40 and you want to give them the impression that their eyes are starting to go.
Look, I think if you got to know us better, you wouldn't have any problem with your daughter dating one of us.
Look, why don't you and Pam come over tomorrow night, a-and you'll see that white people are even better than black people.
You know, before I speak, I like to ask myself, Would Dr. King approve of what I'm about to say?
Look, Jerome, I-I know you think we're all terrible, but white people have done a lot of good things for the world.
Straight up. You ain't swervin' with him, you ain't gonna shump-a-jump, you're not hollerin' at him, you ain't his shorty or his boo.
I own a business, I pay my taxes, and yet I got to deal with this crap every time I step outside my house.
Forgive me for being a protective father, but white people have exploited and mistreated blacks for centuries, and I'm not gonna let that happen to Pam.
Welcome, all, to James Woods High's annual college fair, where each year, our seniors gather to decide where they will go in the fall to get HPV.
I always thought she was gonna be one of those ladies who wears a jean jacket and hangs out at the bar in a chain restaurant.
Yeah, she's a solid B student and that's quite an accomplishment, considering none of her teachers are willing to sleep with her.
No! I was so cold. And you have no idea how many terrifying things there are out here in the dark.
From you. Dad, I've been hearing that song in the backseat of your car since I was a little kid.
Boy, after all this food, we're gonna have a couple of night moves back at the motel later, huh, Dad?
Uh, Night Moves, Like a Rock, Shakedown, The Fire Down Below. Against the Wind was him poopin' out of a car.
By the way, if a girl named Rachel calls, it's a wrong number, but do tell me that she called.
Meg, I'm glad you're having a good time with your father, but don't let him distract you from your priorities.
But a part of growing up is learning how to handle a tough situation on your own, like getting into college or breaking up with your father.
You see, living in the wild, I-I've realized that all the pain I've ever had in my life has-has come from me always trying to be something I'm not.
I wrapped it around my thigh and forgot about it for a week or two and uh, yeah, so, that's my left foot now.
You know, it's not a good sign that this is the first time a lot of people are realizing you had a show.
Oh, and everyone here has pinkeye. ...And that was the moment I stopped being Dwayne Johnson and started being The Rock.
I just figured a plane is a safe place where you and I can hang out and not be seen by our wives.
When Clinton was in the White House, all you needed to vote was a piece of duct tape and a...
I mean, I'm the guy who figured out how much eye contact a band should make during a guitar solo.
And I'm telling you, Cleveland and I have won every three-legged race in Quahog except that time those two one-legged guys formed the perfect running person.
Being born into it was clearly some sort of cosmic mistake, so I'm going back in time to prevent that mistake.
All right, Rupert, time to break up Lois and the fat man before they can conceive me by pressing butts together.
This is your valet, your gardener, your cook, your gamekeeper, your butler, your housekeeper, your parlor maid, your housemaid, your scullery maid, your shoe de-graveler and one superfluous employee who I am not in a gay relationship with.
Jaden was first form in his sixth levels and he's chief scrum-flanker on his varsity boogling team, which, as far as we know, makes us terribly proud.
I call my comic For Pete's Sake, because it points out things that make you shake your head and say, For Pete's sake.
Hey, how about one where you draw a sock, and it says Sock it to me, or-or maybe draw Lois taking a hot-tub dump, and she just says whatever?
I just want to turn in my last For Pete's Sake. going out on top amid a flurry of gambling rumors.
So, you know, um, I'm only wearing this diaper as a dare, you know-- it's not, like, an everyday thing.
Okay, Santa's Little Helper got all tuckered out from his playdate, so he went out back to take a nap under that tree where nobody knows quite where it is.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I-I used to love Duff when I was younger, but I-I haven't even had it in, like, 13 years.
I represent the Duff Brewery, and you, sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement.
Your Honor, citizens of Springfield and visitors from Quahog, my client, the Duff Brewery, is the victim of flagrant intellectual theft.
Several other Duff variations, packages and design elements have been similarly infringed, resulting again and again in pale imitations, chp coes, clumsy counterfeits and weak substitutions.
Well, the Pawtucket Brewery will be shut down, so I guess we got to go back to Quahog and find Peter a new job.
Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice to meet you and your family, even though you kind of screwed us over.
Hey, uh, Marge, uh, listen, there's something difficult that I've been trying to figure out how to tell you, and, um... it's about, uh, Santa's Little Helper.
It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury...
Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore, but you are a local hero for defending our beer, and apparently, that's more important than hating women.
He's obviously cleaning his feet in the pool without making it look like he's cleaning his feet in the pool.
I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great!
It's about a handicapped squirrel who has to learn to overcome his disabilities so he can survive in the wild.
And I would love to attempt to convert my heavily embellished Internet profile and carefully airbrushed, out-of-date photo, into a night of physical intimacy with you...!
Uh, anyway, this is The Hopeful Squirrel. There once was a handicapped squirrel who could not climb trees to get food.
Okay, next page. The squirrel-- the same squirrel from the first page-- hoped that the other animals would share their food with him. 'Please,' said the Hopeful Squirrel. 'If you could all spare just one nut,
Joe, quick, give me the book. And so, the squirrel decided to climb for his own nuts. 'I don't need legs when I've got a positive attitude and arm strength.' 'I'm sorry that we mistreated you,' said Buddy the Badger. 'Could you find it in your heart to share your nuts with us?' 'Of course I'll share with you all,' said the squirrel. 'For if I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped.'
You know, I'd see these crippled kids limping down the sidewalk on my way to work, and I would just laugh and laugh, and I thought, Hey! Put that in a book!
Uh... Captain, this uh... this is a little embarrassing, but, uh, you know, I've never noticed, uh, the little lever I've been pushing, it's... it's only about two-thirds of the way up.
Hey, how many of y'all bitches like to read? Chapter One. It was winter in the forest, so the squirrel was happy he'd built that hot tub. But little did he know, a strain of super gonorrhea was gonna hit him so fierce he'd wish he was still paralyzed from the waist down. On top of that, some son of a bitch killed his brother. The monkey's kick-ass buzz saw hand 'His brains, his brains-- they're everywhere!' the little girl yelled. 'Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!' ...exclaimed Billy the Bullfrog. The woodchuck mom and her baby finished their cocoa and then tucked in for another cozy night.
But then... 'Nothing but cops on the take and hookers on the make,' said Randy the Raccoon. 'What's a hooker?' asked the bunny, who was gay. 'That and a bag of crank is my Saturday night!' spat Randy.
We now return to Hotel TV, the station that makes you feel like you're at a hotel when you're not at a hotel.
It's called Apathetic George. George used to be a curious monkey, but after a month in captivity, all he did was wait for food. The zoo people wanted him to mate, but he lost interest in that, too. 20 years and millions of dollars in zoo revenue later, he died.
Yeah, I found one of my grandmother's old recipes, so I thought I'd make a special batch for the blood drive.
I mean, I've seen that guy get punched in the face a thousand times, and now he's making science stuff.
Imagine coming here and having Cool Dude or Yay Jews or Boo Jews, depending on where you stand on Jews.
Oh, Brian's all serious. Oh, I don't... I don't drink in the morning because I've got to land a plane.
You know, I've got all the papers for the loan officer, but, I got to admit, I'm a little nervous.
I've made a series of small poops in my bath, and I need you to scoop them out with this fishnet.
In fact, the only thing that would make me happier is... would... is... would be if this tub was filled with yawgurt.
All right. Well, we have got work to do, so let's roll up our sleeves and get right to it.
There's a lot to do, so we can't be afraid to just roll up our sleeves and get the job done.
Just roll up those sleeves and address the task at hand, whatever it may be, not shying away from the dirty work, but just rolling up our sleeves and having at it.
I spend $600 a month on scented candles at the farmer's market just because there's a hot chick selling them.
This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile.
I'll go first. Stewie, I remember the day you were born. I thought to myself, here's a kid who's got a white, empty canvas stretched out in front of him.
After you left, I ate cookie dough off the stomach of a 20-year-old, and then I vomited and all the girls laughed at me, and then it came out that they all think I'm fat and old.
Oh, back at the store, I, uh, tucked my boner into the waistband of my pants and now it's sitting weird.
But if you also put in Edward Furlong's movie, Pecker, you got Pecker and Dick in the Glory hole, and you got a tight squeeze, but it-it ought to fit.
Brian, we can try to make you feel a little less repulsive, but we're not spending human money on a deformed animal.
You may argue that this is a waste of energy, but to me, it's worth the comfort because, let's face it, the world is an abrasive place.
The only thing is, anyone can sell a nice house, but a real star is someone who can sell a dump.
The one thing they're pretty firm about at the office is you don't take the inside deals and give them to your friends.
But as your friend, I wanted to let you know early because there's another buyer who's about to snap it up.
Say what you want, but he's got an eye for real estate. Let me just give him a call and let him know he's gonna get the place.
Why don't we go through the profit-loss statement line by line from the past six quarters, which will offer us a good cost analysis comparison that I think we'll be able to utilize as we move forward - Aah! into the next fiscal year.
You can drink from these and then put 'em on your head to be a clown from an Italian opera.
Look, i-if you're not happy with your current property, we could roll your money over into something in Sinkhole Estates.
You know, I used to hate you for it, but... now I think you're the only person who was trying to be my friend.
Then I missed the bus, of course. Then it looked like it was gonna start to rain. Luckily, it didn't.
All right, Brian, first order of business-- we have to decide who gets to ride in the cart and who has to push it.
We've been to every grocery store in town with no luck. are these little packets of weird vitamins that vaguely suggest they help you in the bedroom. Performance and stamina, for men.
Well, the fat man's never going to get back in time, and with him gone, that makes you the man of the house.
You mean, like, fall asleep on the toilet and have a big red ring on my bum for a week?
Yeah, but can we just talk for a second about how brave I was when we walked past that cemetery?
You drove my car into a lake, you almost let me drown, you got us thrown off a bus, you broke our bike, and now you've gotten our turkey stolen and Thanksgiving is ruined and we don't have any transportation and we're still miles from home!
I can throw you off a bridge, and as long as I don't hit a person on a boat, it's okay.
Too bad, because your recently divorced mom has a crush on her trainer, and he eats like this, so now you have to, too.
Almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves-- just like PB and J, but with more of your mom railing this guy.
Brian, maybe you should be a little less mad at me and a little more mad at the guys growing mustaches for this month.
As the oldest guy here, it's my duty to take an open mouth nap in the middle of the room.
I thought we could all take turns telling a long story about how things aren't the way they used to be.
You go to the ballpark, get your bag of Bulls-eyes and watch Hack Wilson round the bases in a big wool shirt.
Up on the right are the people with the awesome trampoline, but they don't let me on it no more,
Now, I wasn't planning on doing this today, but when I look around at all of these open, loving faces or friends and family,
I know you wanted the perfect Thanksgiving, and I know I screwed that all up for you, but when you think about it, isn't this holiday about being with people you love?
You can always tell which fathers are disappointed in their sons because they eat lunch with their coats still on.
And although I will never get over the pain of what you did to my son, I forgive you, because I believe you are sick and in need of help.
You guys, I don't care what we do for my birthday, as long as it lasts the whole week and is very expensive and inconvenient for all my friends.
Well, in high school, my best friend was this hot prostitute, and I just kind of got into the friend zone.
Clearly, there's been a lot of cheating on both sides, but the point is where do we go from here?
You're an atheist, and the one guy you don't believe in is getting to bang the woman of your dreams.
Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie, he'd give me back the use of my legs?
Yeah, Jesus did the same thing to my wife Christmas before last and my buddy's wife the year before that.
Oh, you know, uh... that, uh, this holiest of days is about, uh, appreciating... our loved ones and, uh, resisting... temptation.
I guess your father and I will have to talk to the principal and figure out how to handle this.
Chris seems to be struggling in his classes, and often when kids have trouble in school, it's because something is going on at home.
All right, I'm gonna need three coffins-- mahogany with brass handles-- three new daddies for the dead astronauts' kids, and a black suit for me.
Sam Cooke didn't know much about history, and he got shot in a hotel wearing nothing but a sports coat and a shoe.
All right, Chris, I reviewed your textbook, and I've programmed a tour of the various historical events that you'll need to know for your exam.
I mean, God, if only we could get rid of these damn arms and attach the pen directly to the heart, right?
Hey, Family Guy, you're lucky I got a manicotti in the oven, or I'd bash your face into a bolognese.
Besides, saving this ship would mean talking to, like, 80 people, and I-I'm just not in that kind of mood right now.
I am Lady Antonia Tyler Carrington, the Duchess of Lancashire, the heir to the Earl of Portsmouth, and the cousin of the Countess of Wessex.
Hey, here's a reminder-- as you exit the boat, don't forget to give us your extra snacks because as you know, we work for peanuts!
Hallmark Original Pictures presents an instant family classic: Summers With My Slow Brother, starring a cast of people who make you say Oh, because you didn't think they were still acting.
I haven't been doing well on these practice tests, and I need to improve my score to get into a good college.
Anyway, I was just rereading my favorite passage the other day. The weight of the gun in Jason's hand surprised him.
But a wise book once said, With the heart at stake, right and wrong is a stake through the heart.
I've got a whistle, a cloth helmet, a key to a call box, a soft rubber truncheon, and a map of the city. Please hurry!
All right, cell phones away, eyes on your own paper, and before we start, who's giving me a ride home?
By the way, a huge part of being an idiot is constantly accusing people of thinking they're better than you.
There's only one thing to do: shrink down to microscopic size, enter Brian's brain, and destroy the tumor from within.
Well, since Brian's tumor poses no immediate threat, we can schedule surgery to remove it, and he'll be back to his old self in no time.
My point is, Brian could have the surgery and be smart again, or he could skip the surgery and stay dumb like this.
This is the opera. I'm hoping that re-exposing you to high culture will remind you of the joys of a refined mind.
We're here to have a nice civilized dinner and to show you that you don't have to eat all your meals in your car.
Hey, cram it, skinny. Give me free food or I'm gonna tell people on Yelp there was a pube in my salad.

And just last month, we had to come here when he went into the green room from the yellow room.
Which means there's a father of three in Nebraska who now has a very little chance of receiving one within the next 24 hours.
Now, who wanted the brain? And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.
I've spent my entire life in that ivory tower, learning from pop-up books and animal sound machines, instead of actually experiencing the world.
All right, Meg, while we take these, we can either play Freeze Frame or She Works Hard for the Money.
Well, Meg, the thing is-- my name's Evan, by the way-- a lot of people will pay good money for pictures of sexy feet.
I want to put 'em both in my mouth and then make a slapping sound on my bald head with 'em.
Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.
Well, I'll tell you this, she's got to be the second most amazing girl here, because I've met the most amazing girl.
I'm sorry your life was so screwed up that you almost had a three-way with a dog and a baby, but your life was not without meaning.
Also, I loaned you $40 for that Lumineers T-shirt, and you said you'd pay me back, so I'm gonna take your bra.
Well, Brian, thanks for going on that little adventure with me, but I think I've learned quite enough from the real world for now.
We've got all the awesome evidence we need. Hello, my name is Glenn Quagmire. I am a neighbor of yours on Spooner Street.
My only hope for leniency is to bring in character witnesses and show the court I'm not the monster they say I am.
And as we know, according to Game of Thrones, if the girl has had her blood, she is good to go.
Well, it's when you urinate in a condom, and tie it off, freeze it, and then the woman, um, pretends it's a man.
The only way I learned my ABC's was by learning the names of all the guys my mom slept with.
Your Honor, I have renounced my sinful past, and have been washed in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
I have seen the righteous path of our Savior, and ask that you not sentence my son to jail, but instead release him to my custody so that I, with God's guidance, can rehabilitate him.
And maybe through our shared relationship with the Lord, we can begin to build a bond as mother and son. Mother and son?!
You couldn't have been here for three hours on this, the hottest day of the year, or the ice cubes in your pitcher would have melted.
This milk crate will be my chair, this overturned rain barrel will be my desk, and this DNA evidence centrifuge and fingerprint scanner will be my coatrack.
But I'm telling you, it's gonna be a bigger waste of time than writing tough-guy dialogue for a Jet Li movie.
And look, if you really want to learn how to bang that thing, there's no better teacher than your old dad.
I'm gonna have to write to somebody about this. Dear Penthouse, I used to think these letters were fake until my taped-together, soccer-ball-headed girlfriend fell in my lap.
She's perfect, because she's only sort of hot, so there won't be this crazy disconnect of her face on your body, which would totally take me out of it.
And on Saturday, she's hosting her book club, so I have to drop by, say something funny, and then stay upstairs.
But I just want you to know, if you ever treat a real woman the way you treat that doll, you're gonna make her very happy.
Don't answer. It's just that Brian's been so distant lately, and we used to be inseparable-- like Jack and Jill.
Jill had a tooth fall out, and she swallowed it, and then we had to root through her feces to find it.
Some sad news this morning as 38 schoolchildren drowned when their-- excuse me-- when their school bus hit a patch of ice and drove off a loc-- what is wrong with me today?-- and drove off a local bridge.
All right, well, a U.S. convoy was ambushed in Kabul this morning, so now we're going to have a moment of silence in remembrance...
It'll just take a second. I-I normally wouldn't do this, but I was already kind of in the middle of something, and I just need to quickly respond, and there I am finiiished.
I'm just going to take a little bit of his DNA, and soon we'll be proud parents, like Ron Livingston's parents.
There. Now I just have to get into the machine, and then the machine does whatever it has to do to me in order to successfully impregnate me.
Stewie, you have to get rid of it. Get rid of it? You know, why don't you just say it?
Hi, I'm Joe Swanson, and this is 30 impressions in 30 seconds. Show me the money. Oh, behave. Good morning, Vietnam. Wait until they get a load of me, said the Joker.
Oh, and while I'm pregnant, I'm going to need you to change the cat litter. We don't have a cat.
Could you do that thing where you take some fluid and tell me if it's going to be an imbecile or a cretin?
Okay, now people really love that viral video of a monkey forcin' that sex act on a frog at the zoo.
Oh, I caught two of them trying to eat each other, so that's something we need to watch out for.
That sucks. And I worked really hard on taking a picture of myself every day for a year and then setting the photos to an emotional song.
Hey! Are you a big, fat bastard who loves eating at Outback Steakhouse, but thinks the portions are too small?
I strive for these things, and I get them, but at the end of the day, I still don't feel fulfilled.
She didn't say good morning to me, so I put an orange dot on her boarding pass, which means they're going to search her anus.
Well, I was doing the dishes for a while, but they were inexperienced, so I ended up having to rub one out.
Why would I talk to Cleveland? He's a therapist now, and he's really great at helping people with their problems.
Cleveland helped me see that our entire relationship has been you doing whatever you want and me cleaning up the mess.
Or... remember when Cleveland wore briefs under his boxers and we found out and he told us not to say anything?
Look, if you don't change what you're saying, we're gonna tell Donna you slept with that stripper at your bachelor party.
It's two to two in the bottom of the sixth, and I just can't get my eyes off that man with the tall head.
And since he eats, like, nine candy bars a day, if we wait here at the convenience store, he's bound to show up.
Yeah. I was thinking maybe our best bet is to just drive around town and see if we can spot him.
Ordinarily I'd say no, but that adult kickball league is coming in for drinks, so let's get out of here.
I wanted to see if a billboard had real pudding in it, so I climbed up there and came out a hero.
It's just like Gandhi always said, eat as much as you want and do whatever, and don't be afraid to hit each other.
I'm talking like this because I'm being very careful not to upset you, and for some reason this is the voice people use to do that.
I got to be honest, Joe, we came over here because we were worried about you, but these candies tell me you're doing great.
I stopped listening to him back at the drive-thru when he leaned out the window and ordered a fur burger.
Look, you guys, what we really need to do is bring him back to Quahog where we can get him some help.
You know, I spent the whole time trying to kill myself, but it took seeing you guys almost die to realize that life really is worth living.
I hired some guys to come to the house on Tuesday and assault her, and I'll come in and save her, and she'll be so grateful, she'll have to take me back.
Let's see. Smoked whitefish, herring in cream sauce, smoked sable-- that's a different kind of whitefish-- and for dessert, the only bad cookie in the world.
Oh, yeah, right. Can we do what we normally do, where you roll it up in a piece of cheese like you're fooling me? Yeah, I guess, but then you're gonna have cheese in your ass.
Look, I know it sounds a little rough, but why don't we start with a gentle massage of the area and see how you feel?
So from now on, anytime you got to cut one, you pull your pants down and you do it through this fart hole.
You're damn right I did! And I'll do it again if you don't stay the hell away from my ass!
All right, I need you to buy a birthday present for my friend Jeff-- he likes the Packers and surfing.
Look, I'd love to stay and talk, Neil, but I have homework, and there was no toilet paper in the girls' bathroom.
You mean like a slice of turkey, or like a short section of one musical recording that's been digitally repurposed to be part of a new song?
Ladies and gentlemen and people who have wandered in from the Chinese wedding next door, welcome to the roast of Peter Griffin, with your roast master Glenn Quagmire.
You know, Peter's challenging the stereotype of Irish guys being fat, drunk and stupid by throwing a little gay in there, too.
But I got to say, the worst part of being Peter's friend is knowing that eventually you're gonna have to be the fat-ass's pallbearer.
This just in... is what Peter had to say to his wife on their wedding night, so she knew it was actually happening.
For those of you who don't know, we have a real serious problem with people getting raped in our holding cell down at the station.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, now that we've had our fun, it's time to give our man of the hour a chance to have his say.
Yeah, but I thought they'd stick to material about how I'm too handsome to work at a brewery, or-or how I have tiny little baby sneezes.
Hey, it's cool you got the keys to the school, and we can hang out when no one else is here.
Wow, you know, I know I just met you guys, but I've kind of been looking for a new group of friends.
Well, I think I speak for all of us when I say we'd love to have you in our group of girlfriends.
Hey, isn't it funny that you guys came over for a dinner party, and all we're doing is standing in the kitchen, drinking wine?
Lois tried to give CPR to a kid at a wedding once, and when she knelt down, she accidentally high-heeled her own stink hole.
Look, the thing is, me and my new girlfriends, we've kind of been talking trash about you and laughing behind your back.
Because men might punch you in the gut and call you a fat idiot, but at least they do it to your face and own it.
Quagfest? What's that? You and a guest are cordially invited to witness Glenn Quagmire's at Quagfest, a three-day festival celebrating the three F's: food, fun, and...
There hasn't been that kind of excitement on our street since we had that big Dumpster in our front yard.
Yeah, every time you get a couple of beers in you, we have to hear all about how you can beat up Liam Neeson.
Hey, you know this old woman who lived in a shoe, she had so many children, she didn't know what to do?
Oh, I-I just assumed after that incident in the parking lot with that bitch in the Lexus, you wouldn't want me to.
I mean, we just had a great day of fun and rides and finger-sniffing, and all you can talk about is fighting some guy you've never even met!
Hello, sir. We're here to see Liam Neeson, the guy who wears the same long jacket in all his movies.
The best way to kill wolves is to kill their leader, wear his skin, kiss some of the wolves, then kill them.
Miss Tammy's in her car yelling at her boyfriend on the phone again, so it looks like I'm doing lunch.
Okay, Landon, time to sabotage you with the most dangerous thing in the world for a toddler: a whole, uncut grape.
Mom, Dad, I've done a lot of thinking, and I've decided I don't want to go into the family business.
Um, first, I've been summoned to be a potential juror, but I don't want to go, so I need you to report in my name.
Um, I would try to be fair, but, uh, I am on record, you know, very famously, as having released a kraken.
It was very funny and enjoyable, so what I need you to do is to go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
And besides, my week as a helper mommy is done now, so when you come home today, you'll have me all to yourself.
Now, Peter, I'm out of crackers, and I'm gluten-free, so what I need you to do is go to a local gym and ask men to pee in your hands.
Oh, she wanted to be here, but she got hired to be the stuffy old woman who slowly comes around to it in a rap video.
All right, I know most of you haven't traveled with me, but get ready to see a lot of airport elevators you didn't know existed.
Sorry, I'm being told this would be very expensive to animate, so instead, here's some stock footage of an old plane trying to take off.
We will. Come on, girls, let's go wear big floppy sun hats in the pool and then be mad when they get wet.
I'm gonna show you kids how to have fun the old-fashioned way, like I did when I was a kid.
Okay, last night I did some personality assessments based on yesterday's session, and what I found was none of you couples are compatible with each other at all.
Well, back when I was your age, there was nothing better than knocking on doors and throwing paper bags full of flour at people.
Yes, sorry to deceive you all, but we find that when couples don't respond to traditional counseling, the stress of extreme danger reminds them of what matters most in their lives-- their love for each other.
All right, Lois, let's just leave our bags here and wonder where our clothes are for the next two days.
Yes, he's been a little difficult to deal with, and on page two of three in the How To Be a Teacher manual, it says that any child who's being difficult should be medicated.
Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me when I was telling you about Kevin trying to hang himself with an extension cord.
I had house-sat for her Aah! while she was visiting her aunt in Vernon Oh, God. and she wanted to thank me.
Instead of embracing their mental gifts, their first reaction is to shoot them up with hard-core drugs until they're mindless sheeple.
Yeah. And college kids take it all the time so they can focus on their studies and drinking alcohol with their butts.
And as I'm walking you through the steps, watch your screen for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips: helpful hints and food factoids to make your meal a success.
And in that bag, we'll combine one large, finely-chopped garlic clove; one tablespoon of grated, peeled fresh ginger; two teaspoons of five-spice powder; a teaspoon of salt; and a half teaspoon of fresh ground pepper.
Then you're gonna want to add the duck breasts, seal the bag, and refrigerate that for at least one hour, or up to 24 hours, if you want to prepare this ahead of time.
And I just figured, the hell with it, why not build a scale model and record voices for all the characters? Watch.
Okay, Joe, Peter and I are going head-to-head in that cooking competition, and they're letting us each use an assistant.
You just took a lot of pills, mashed together a bunch of sci-fi and fantasy clichés and crapped out a 2,000-page turd.
I put this pair of pants on the front legs of this horse and strapped Joe to the front with his legs tied behind the horse's neck.
And then we put Cinnamon's head up the back of Joe's shirt and simply hid the rest of the horse behind this curtain.
I just found out I'm actually going to be tall, so I'm no longer comfortable hanging out with someone whose teeth are bigger than their fingers.
Nothing's stopping you from going over there and telling him the truth: that his son is a paraplegic who's stuck in a wheelchair.
I spend one afternoon with the guy, and it's like I signed an eight-year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child.
You know, it's times like this where I think, if I didn't talk and you were a normal baby, we wouldn't have any of these problems.
Well, Dad, I can tell you from experience it's only when your worst fears come true that you get to find out how strong you really are.
Just give me the phone. No, no. I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
Was it a re-run on basic cable, because sometimes they edit those a lot and that could be why you were confused?
Hey, so, um... you know, maybe it's me, but I kind of feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides.
Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there, but I want you to try it one more time, like this: Duh!
So I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long, until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City.
Now I can do fun things like get on your shoulders and wear a trench coat and be tall enough to ride roller coasters.
I am clearly above the minimum height requirement and shall now ride your roller coaster, for which you are an attendant.
I moved the van over to the other gas pump, and the gas cap was still on the wrong side.
We did get another one yesterday, but some fat-ass blew out half the springs, so we put lunch on it.
I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight after they see how many slaps it takes to give me a stutter.
I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met, in the order that I met them, last name first, and if anyone interrupts me, I'll have to start over.
You know, I like them horror movies where you got a couple of teenagers getting busy in their car at Makeout Point, but there's a killer on the loose.
We should write one of them zombie movies where a guy wakes up in a comfortable cotton hospital gown with the back open so there's a nice breeze on your behind, and he's like, This ain't bad.
I-I don't know, I-I was thinking we'd write a movie where something that's not supposed to be scary becomes scary.
Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa, are you enjoying that new soap I bought you from that mysterious Chinese man whose store was weirdly not there the next day?
So just relax, take your glasses off, take a nice, dry sauna-- no glasses in the sauna-- just leave those puppies in the locker.
Hey, hey, when you were a cop, when you were going to a crime scene, did you go chung Chung, like Law & Order?
Oh, hey, check it out, man, when you were a cop, did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs when you were getting kinky with your girl?
Okay, I am really on edge and this thing we're doin', I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist's book.
I want to stay here and see what you're seeing, because you're saying things that I think are somethin' totally different than what they are.
Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's.
This guy used to live in your house and a box of his old porn is still hidden in there.
By the time you watch this, you'll be grown-up, so I'm sure you're allowed to eat ice cream and pizza for every meal. You know it.
I just hope to God you're not stuck in some loser job, like in a brewery, or a toy factory, or a fishing boat. Oh, boy.
Right near the basket, underhanded, effeminate gasp, over the backboard, out of bounds, waddle over to get it, slip on a towel, twist my ankle, go to the emergency room, doctors tell me it's not that bad and I shouldn't have come there,
I don't want him to end up like me-- dead-end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where fat's supposed to be, and fat where skinny's supposed to be.
And to do that, you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz, with little something from every part of he world pinned on you.
Well, I been trying to make Chris less of a fat dummy, and nothing seems to be working, so now we're high-stepping around in giant hats.
Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available,
I mean, you went to Brown, you're a published author, you can hear it first when Joe falls out of the tub.
And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival and went to a Q and A to ask questions that weren't really questions.
Check it out, Lois-- when Chris notices that World's Greatest Son mug I made, he'll be back on board with his old man in no time.
All right, Chris, now I know you're all sophisticated now, but no man can resist the siren call of mentally impaired supermodel Kate Upton.
You wanted Chris to be a better person with a bright future, and thanks to Brian, that's what he has now.
That doesn't sound right. ...and he hated the noise from the local port, so he filed one of the very first port noise complaints in maritime law.
Look, Chris, you're my kid, and I want what's best for you, but I guess I just don't want you to become too good for your old man.

Monster Energy Drink. What is it? I don't know, but it's free from this truck that stopped outside your work.
Mr. Griffin has shown good faith in appearing here today and will not be subjected to this sort of hostile interrogation.
What just happened was a national tragedy, but it's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Andrea the Giant!
We will never forget what happened yesterday, but you'll also never forget what's gonna happen September 17 at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena!
And then, so I'm like, Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?
Look, I-I just want you to know, I feel bad about what happened with you and Aunt Karen the other day.
And maybe if you finally do, she'll stop terrorizing you, and you won't have to take it out on me for the rest of my life.
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat your sister in the ring, you got to get to the root of your fears.
And we've got quite a match tonight between Heavy Flo and another woman whose name I've forgotten but I'm sure is a gross pun.
You know, this was the fanciest restaurant in Quahog when I was a kid. The ladies' room has a big space with chairs in it, like a living room, before you get back to where the crappers are.
I'll handle this. All right, here's what you're gonna do: skip the live music. Get yourself a room over at the Wickford Marina. Take her out on a balcony, point to any boat in the harbor, and tell her it's yours.
I call 'em rubbers. Or you could just pull the hose out of the bucket and let it spray free.
Chris, now that I'm a toothpick guy, it's my job to sit on a BMX bike outside the rec center and ask every kid if they're the new kid.
Well, the most intimidating people are toothpick guys who work at seafood counters and make people uncomfortable for not knowing about fish.
Lois, we got to drive to Smitty's right now and get one. Now? But we told Chris we'd be there when he wakes up from surgery.
Yeah, but we got to get going. Carter's our babysitter, and if he's with the kids too long, they start sayin' racisms.
You like to play the field, but, deep down, you really wish you had a woman like Lois, don't you?
Long time. And yet we've never discussed mothers' maiden names, the names of old pets, high school mascots, favorite teachers. Heck, I don't even know the last four digits of your Social.
By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage.
Too big a deal?! The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife!
You know what? I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl.
No way! How am I supposed to be friends with someone who's in love with my wife? Quagmire is dead to me and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.
And then I lost my wood, and so we just watched Colbert, and then I took a dump completely nude.
I lost my best friend, my buddies are all fighting, that chick at work is saying stuff that ain't true.
Joe's a little worse than the rest of us, but we all just shove our thoughts deep down, where they can't hurt anybody.
You and your friends can run from a bunch live bulls, and lots of times, there's a chick whose boob comes out.
And you probably don't want any reminders of Bonnie around the house, so I cleared out all of her underwear.
Yeah, that's why I looked into it, and we've reserved a place for him at the State Home for Mentals and Bastards.
Hey, Joe, you know that movie you told me to watch that you said was your favorite movie of all time, and you said I had to watch it?
Would the French people let their boss walk around in stained underwear trying to stab people if the place wasn't nice?
Her husband's a maniac and the only reason he hasn't killed me is because he thinks I'm just his pet dog.
Yeah, it turns out Dr. Hartman's cell phone was pressing on my spinal cord, and that's what was causing my total paralysis.
Yeah, sorry we dropped the ball for a while, which is the way we agreed we'd describe what we did to you, which hopefully makes it seem less heinous.
Hey, great idea bringing the couch out here from your den, Peter. Yeah, Lois and I dragged it out here last night for a little hump sesh, so I figured I'd let it dry. Couch. That's one of those words that if you say it over and over it starts to sound silly.
Besides, you can't just go get a gun, you have to be certified in gun safety, go through an extensive background screening process.
There's some weird, big-nose guy hiding in the bushes outside some chick's house. My heart always timidly hides itself behind my mind. I set out to bring down stars from the sky... Ow. Ow. Oh, my God, four men are beating me. My arm. I think it is broken. Who are you guys? Why? Why? I'll give you anything if you would only stop hitting me. Please stop pulling my nose. It is not fake. I think I am dying.
For real. Come on! Let's fool around, or watch a movie, or finally click that Crackle icon on the TV.
That's right, Tom. My family and I believe this shooting was a hate crime, and we'd like to see Mr. Griffin held accountable for his actions.
The cashier at the grocery store told her to push on, and then she snapped her fingers, and now I think she's my new favorite lady in the world.
Lois, to show I'm in touch with what it's like to be African-American, I am gonna go to the middle of the town square, get naked and paint myself brown.
Not like when I read my JAG fan fiction at the NCIS convention. JAG stood up and yelled, 'Objection, Your Honor, by Navy law.' He then turned to the lady lawyer, the gal from the October Maxim, who still managed to be hot despite her sexless, pageboy haircut.
Yeah, white paper. Check your jacket pocket. I don't think it's lost on any of us that the laws are written on white paper.
And doesn't he have the lyrics, I put the gun to you. I'll kill ya, I'll chop ya up, put ya inside the mattress like drug money?
Your Honor, I'd like to enter into evidence this photo of a badly beaten Rihanna as well as this print ad for the Entourage movie.
I'll be on the toilet, wearing a T-shirt that's so long I have to hold it under my chin while I wipe.
I saw an ad in the paper for guys over five-foot-four, and I was the only one who showed up.
Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?
All right, gang, me and the guys are off to Korea to find the last episode of a soap opera Quagmire was in.
I feel like I want to giggle behind my hand at a lot of things and hold, but not eat, a big ice cream cone.
Have you ever killed a dog while driving drunk, and then been upset that there was no way for your car engine to cook it for you on the rest of the drive home?
Just put the dog in the bag, place it over the engine block, and drive your usual over the speed limit.
I can get drunk whenever, sleep with anyone, and just hide in my house and avoid the world if I feel like it.
All you're doing is getting into trouble and digging up junk when we really need to be saving for Stewie's college.
We saw an ad looking for a toddler to appear in a peanut butter commercial and we thought we'd bring Susie.
You know, because of that one time you got in the trash and ate a whole jar of recalled peanut butter?
Hey. Hey. This is you. I'm Brian. I like garbage peanut butter, and I wear my 'I Voted' sticker for a week and a half.
You know, this is a nice dinner and all, but I thought you guys were going to save this commercial money for Stewie's college fund.
Yeah, and besides, it's been a while since we ate at a place where if you ask for ketchup, they look at you like you're dirt.
Hi, everybody, we're a little crunched for time, so we're gonna have to audition people right here in the hallway.
It's one part 5-Hour Energy, and the other three hours are espresso, Scotts Turf Builder, and a tiny, tiny super-small amount of cocaine.
They all started out just like you, but eventually they were destroyed by their parents' greed, drugs or perverted Hollywood directors.
You know, Brian, that acting stuff was a bit much for me, but I did quite enjoy the dancing and the cocaine.
For a while. I might crash when I'm 18, but then I'll just turn to the Lord and working out.
Uh, I'll take one terrible beer, filled up way too high, so I spill most of it, and a too-long hot dog on a too-short bun.
I can't wait to have diarrhea in the stall with no door while 20 guys wait for me to finish.
I'm just finishing up an e-mail to Delta. I have never not screamed at the top of my lungs during air pressure changes, and I do not intend to stop now.
All he needs is a hundred grand to pay legal fees, and then as soon as he gets his money, I get a million bucks.
Oh, it was fine, though I don't know why they made us face each other during the mother-daughter bikini wax.
Oh, just so you know, I didn't tell Lois where we're going, and I couldn't be touched until I was two.
That African warlord is brutalizing those innocent people. Yeah, but it's okay, because he's wearing a large cowboy hat and follows everything with hamburger, like that stand-up comic from the '90s.
It is with the money that you sent that we have been able to make many wonderful improvements to our village.
It was your money that paid for the school, a well to provide clean drinking water, our first health clinic, and a Redbox with one movie in it.
I have no choice but to write a memoir of my struggles. Chapter One: Harry Potter's aunt and uncle were super mean. 'Spank me harder,' the lady says to Fifty Shades of Grey. 'That's Mr. Fifty Shades of Grey to you, Kate from Ben and Kate.' And then he turned her butt inside out.
Because, sexy. 'Isn't that special,' said the Church Lady, before reporting for her botched surgery. Anyway, I'm here in a prison against my will, and I should be free.
But, in other news, domestic abuse enthusiast Paul Simon has released a new song inspired by a memoir written by Quahog's own Peter Griffin, who has been falsely imprisoned by his father-in-law in an African jail.
I was just saying that because I was worried you'd become popular and not want to be friends with us anymore.
Even at the speed of light, mean-spirited thoughts from the stars can take thousands or even millions of years to reach the Earth.
You know, when they recorded Movin' Out, someone left the studio doors open, and that's why, at the end, you hear that car sound.
Excuse me, I thought you were helping me find a look that'll let me cling to my youth in my 40s.
Ugh. I went out of town for a little while, but I made the mistake of using this app called Bear B'n'B.
Just a reminder, we ask that you not use the DVD player, but you can watch any of the VHSs.
And apparently the girl... Oh, thank God. ...he sent it to doesn't like him back, so she turned him in.
Local teenage scumbag Chris Griffin, whose name will be omitted here, was caught sending, quote-unquote, graphic selfies of his hog-- not sure where that quote is from-- to another underage student.
Oh, I wish you could, sweetie, but the law says that, as a sex offender, you have to complete a rehabilitation course.
I'm deathly allergic to pineapple, pork, rum, macadamia nuts, stupid tiny guitars, overpriced golf, sentimental military stuff, lava, people who I can't tell are black or Asian, apostrophes, anyone twirling flames, second weddings and linen pants.
All right, before we begin, whoever's driving a windowless van painted like an ice cream truck, your lights are on.
Mr. Quagmire, I completed that sex rehab and I paid my debt to society, but people are still afraid of me, like I'm some kind of creep.
You can't. I'm sorry, Chris, but you're just gonna have to accept that from now on, people are gonna see you as a sex-crazed pervert.
Now nobody will have any reason to be afraid of me or think I'm a pervert, and everybody can just treat me like normal again.
Look, Chris, I know you think chemical castration is gonna solve your problems, but you have to stop taking those pills.
Thanks. You know, I just pretend that tennis ball is Mitch McConnell trying to roll back subsidies on the Affordable Care Act, and I'm like, Nope!
It's only a matter of time before he shaves one side of his head and swoops the rest of the hair over.
I will drop you to your knees and shove my racket so far down your throat you'll be my grip for a week!
So to find the area of this circle, we're going to need to use pi, whose digits go on forever.
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.
Black guys put hot sauce on everything, on account of most of us been pepper-sprayed by the time we're two.
All right, we're gonna open this fire hydrant and you're gonna drink as much water from it as you can.
But first, the public library suffered damage this evening when an area fat man smashed through the front of the building while attempting a drunken stunt.
And if we can't trust a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly, then I have no choice but to take action.
And if there's one thing the new drinking age law has done, it's let us know that women tell terrible stories.
Joyce, I'm standing here on the streets of Quahog, where citizens are feeling the effects of the city's new drinking law.
I was going to bone my girlfriend, but she told me that if there wasn't vanilla vodka involved, there was no way.
I think we just have to trust our elected officials... and Goldman's Pharmacy is fully stocked on cough syrup, which goes great with ginger ale.
Well, I do miss drinking, but I have used the time to reconnect with my children and I'm actually thinking about resuming my actuarial practice.
All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on, so I'm gonna go bite at the water a little bit.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a half a can of hot beer left in this open container I've been driving around with.
Well, I'm not the smartest man in the world, but I can always look back on my life and say I went for it.
I've been doing some research, and it says here that in eight months, we can get a non-binding proposition on the ballot as long as we get 4,000 signatures.
And everybody knows the best way to get any law struck down is to get the gays angry about it.
And it gives people the courage to sneak onto their mayor's property and blackmail him and eat all his ripe tomatoes.
Well, Peter, I'm just happy that you and Brian managed to get that law repealed, and that you're finally friends again.
Well, the whole time the guy's saying he doesn't care that, uh, this Jimmy fella cracked the corn, but yet he wrote an entire song about it.

It seems weird that I'd have a joke in my own dream that I don't get. Oh, thank you so...
So maybe if we make a list of the things you're most afraid of, we can face and conquer these fears together, and then your nightmares'll end.
Well, that's what I said, but then he did it, and I was like, Oh, all right, okay, yeah, kind of.
You see, once connected to this device, you will be able to enter my sleeping mind, where you will end these horrible dreams once and for all.
And once you're in my dream, your job is to stop these nightmares by finding that monster and killing him.
B, run downhill, or C, stand your ground? ...and just because of the roles I play, people always assume I'm very serious in real life.
You've been more of a father figure to me than the fat man ever has been or ever will be.
Look, I know I'm always busting your balls, but it's just because you're the only person in this house whose judgment actually matters to me.
Sure did. Turned out that monster was nothing more than a manifestation of your subconscious desire not to disappoint me.

Here, we brought you guys an orchid from Trader Joe's, because we don't know or care about any of your interests.
Well, let's break for presents, but after that, I'll show you Susie's birth video, and I'll tell you, she fell out of there like an orange out of an old dress sock.
I wanted to do with my life, but now, I'm 46, and all I've ever done is take care of Joe.
I mean, I'm happy that Peter found me and gave me a home, but sometimes I wonder if I'd be happier on my own.
For instance, blonde chick in the third row will wash my car this afternoon while, Little Miss Frumpkin with all the questions, will work in an old folks' home.
Yeah, I figured it was the least we could do, since you pulled up a beheading video on your phone at their party and showed it to everyone.
I, uh, feel that things have been awkward between us, but just to show you there's no hard feelings, can I buy you a drink?
Hurry, take everything, and be quick or we'll be in bigger trouble than a fat guy at a water park.
All right, now when Joe gets here we're just going to tell him he needs to lighten up on Brian, and then we'll all talk this thing out so we can move past it.
Even though Brian's been trying to do my wife for years, and on some level, I hate him for it.
Oh, Brian's a complete dick, we all know that, but I think we're losing sight of the point that Bonnie's a weird slut who's always letting you know she's open for business.
If you could talk with even a little bit of inflection to your voice, so it doesn't sound so much like a power sander.
Okay, we ditch this stuff in the day room, and then I'm done with my volunteer hours and we never come back here again.
You will spend time with us every afternoon after school, doing jigsaw puzzles, reading us the newspaper, listening to poorly remembered stories that have no point.
Over the years, I probably have become too dependent on you, and I'm sorry if you've had to put your dreams on hold because of me.
I promise I'll spend the rest of my days taking care of you, just the way you've always taken care of me.
Really? Is that the one where they make 'em dress in the little shorts and hats like the guy in AC/DC?
Yeah, I'd be happy to get you an interview, and as a white woman, you'd be a minority here, unless you're an alcoholic.
Oh, the post office anticipates that within the next five years at least 200 million men in this country will be ordering and receiving RealDolls.
You can put one in your car and drive in the car pool lane with it and then maybe you push her head down, thus defeating the purpose of the car pool lane while fulfilling the purpose of the RealDoll.
Maybe later you ask yourself some tough questions, like, Why is it so important to you to impress and excite truckers?
Another good postal tip is, if you wait to deliver your mail at night, you can smell a lot of really nice dinners.
Come on, let's go see if the maid brought her son, so we can push him and he can't do anything.
And so I say to you, America, we are going to win this war, we're going to end this depression, and there's no reason to suspect that I cannot walk.
It's all the stale mail what never got delivered for one reason or the other: incomplete addresses, house at the top of a hill, anyone who uses one of those
Aw, there was a time when the president of the Jonathan Taylor Thomas Fan Club got a lot of mail.
My mother dipped me into the River Styx and she held me by my heels, so that's the only part that can be injured.
You know, the one where you said that you were having doubts about marrying Lois and you still had thoughts about marrying me.
Oh, then I suppose your wife is entitled to know that you were still in love with me just days before your wedding.
Look, Gretchen, I-I know I wrote you that letter, and-and-and I meant it at the time, but... it was 20 years ago!
Let me go home with one last good memory, and then I promise, you have heard the last of Gretchen Mercer.
Well, they didn't like me beating up Gretchen on federal property, and then after your father plugged up that P.O. box, there was a mutual parting of the ways.
Well, Stewie, I guess since Lois lost her job, you're not going to be able to go to that fancy preschool anymore.
Sorry, sorry, my buddy sent me a bunch of Romanian porn, and now every girl I look at I imagine throwing onto a table.
Say something! ...and I turned around, and I don't know what happened to my wife, and now I'm all alone and I'm just so scared.
Are you still-- by the way, you have no idea what a helicopter sounds like-- are you still keeping up this charade?
If this train slows to less than 50 miles an hour, then Sandra Bullock has to marry a neo-Nazi and act like she didn't know about it, and then overcompensate by adopting a black kid.
But we begin with breaking news from the Quahog Mall, where a local fat man was stuck overnight on a child's train.
We had a bottle of wine and a joint at Bonnie's house, and we want to watch Dallas Portland before the buzz wears off.
Well, we got to get that ring out of you, and this is a place where people buy disgusting cereals to help them poop.
I was just trying to get this guy to poop, but now we're this close to getting sex outlawed in the United States.
Getting out of that wind storm that screwed up my hair and loosened my tie, but also trying to forget how mad I am at Dallas Portland.
Sorry, I still get a little dizzy from the train, but if Dallas Portland's on TV every night, my life's gonna be a living hell.
Well, if he's the hot, young thing and everybody loves him, all we got to do is make you hotter and younger and thing-er!
She was my biggest inspiration, and she was... taken from me when I was 12... in a fatal car accident.
All right, Tom, if you want to be young these days, you gotta do a wicked awesome GoPro skate video.
Okay, Tom, uh, our top story tonight: a burst water pipe in the pediatric unit of Quahog General results in the tragic drowning deaths of four children and one nurse.
Today on CBS This Morning, we'll be talking about how much sleep you need to not be drunk from the night before.
You know, Brian, this wouldn't have happened if you were just honest with women and had an ounce of integrity.
Tom was just trying to talk me down, and if there's a news story here, the only one I'm giving it to is Tom Tucker.
Yeah, apparently, when he interviewed me up on that roof, the ratings were so huge, they made him anchor again.
And as a special treat, I thought I'd deliver them in the rapping style you kids are so enthused about.
All right, students. The votes have been tabulated, so if you could all look up from your phones for a minute,
I don't know, but if they are, we got to get down to that school and talk 'em out of it.
All right, if we want Cleveland to stop spending all his time with Jerome, we got to remind him how much fun we are.
All right, if we want to get Cleveland back, we should just put out his favorite snack: an open can of tuna.
I don't know my way around the school, so I figured I'd get the deets from a couple of seniors.
Well, we realized you like hanging out with Jerome because he's black, so we wanted you to know we can be black guys, too.
And finally, tonight, a moving story from James Woods High, where the student body has made their homecoming a special event for a very special boy.
That's right. Chris Griffin, a tubby spaz with a heart full of dreams, gets to feel normal for a night, thanks to the kindness of his peers.
I just see him walking around with his hands down his pants all day, and he's just so fat and weird, so we feel bad.
I mean, you don't think I hang out with you because of your endless stories about working your remote control or your fat son or how you once made a dog shake its head no?
There's the thrill of the game, people bring snacks, plus you'll hear some pretty unfiltered opinions about those jokers in Washington.
Look, Joe, I'm a little busy right now, so I'm gonna have the Somali pirate from Captain Phillips tell you something.
And what that is is to indicate our international sales, which peaked, of course,  Oh, yeah. during the last quarter.
Family, guests, and monkeys who have wandered in to steal fruit, it is my honor to welcome you to this engagement celebration.
Great, just give me a chance to raise the money, so I can marry your daughter and make her happy.
Brian, I am deeply touched that you came all this way to find me, but the truth is, you and I have very little in common.
Uch. All they're doing is announcing that they play the kazoo, and then asking if others also play the kazoo.
Well, maybe even my old job as the guy racing through an airport at the end of a romantic comedy.
Your paperwork appears to be in order, but before we get started, do you own a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear if you worked on a fishing boat?
Now, the first thing I need you to do every morning is punch me in the stomach because I'm a bad person.
I could wear a shirt that's both red and blue, and you can do spin art with all the wussy kids who are afraid to go on rides.
If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180.
So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us and go back to the way things were?
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that, but it's a shame we can't get good Italian food like this in Quahog.
Hey, look, I don't know if you guys are really staying here, but you can't get into the pool without a room key.
Okay, Chris, your mom and I want to help you get out some of that aggression, so I thought you and me could huck rotten apples at passing cars.
Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck.
This dad took one look at Chris and thought he'd suck, but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.
Our top story tonight, the James Woods High baseball team is headed to the district championship, thanks to their secret weapon, star pitcher Chris Griffin.
Well, for the last few weeks, since my right arm's been exhausted from pitching, my left arm's had to, uh, pick up the slack in the bathroom.
The next pitch Chris threw hit his coach in the head, so there was no one to take him out of the game.
Well, if you need insurance that bad, maybe it's time for you to go out and get a job of your own.
Captain Cockpit, my friend is about to get married, and we were wondering if you'd have sex with her for $500.
Hey, Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice you got some dry cleaning hanging up in the backseat of your car.
Hey, maybe you could drive me around and help me out, and I could even pay you a little something for your time.
I hear on SNL the women are funnier than the guys now, but I don't know, I'll never see it.
We meet Quagmire, a small-town boy with big-city dreams who has fallen deep into the game of prostitution at the Point.
I kind of want to see Guardians of the Galaxy, but I also kind of feel like there might be scary parts.
You know what that means? Shopping for groceries is what I say instead of, Do you want to pay me for sex? so I can't get arrested.
And then hold the incision open with a vise grip, and use the slip-joint pliers to get the muscle back in position.
I guess I just got caught up in the money and-and assumed you were okay with it because of the sex.
And-and we both called the Apple store, and they said they can't disprove that it doesn't happen, so here we are, still married, still on the show.
A-And it's happened five times since then, and some of the pictures had both Peter and the girl in them.
Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy, and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.
Hi. Are you a straight, adult male who likes to eat crepes without people making unwanted assumptions about your private life?
And here we are... the Family Guy writers' room... where the writers are hard at work with the show's talented cast.
Look, don't get me wrong, guys, I-I think it's hilarious, and-and I totally get that the sex thing is what made me popular, but would it kill us to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?
Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes, so he could shoot that crappy movie... what was it?
The table read is where the Family Guy cast reads aloud that week's script to see how the story and the jokes are working.
Given this surprising development, we decided to follow Peter, and see if our cameras could capture his story, as well.
Yeah, well, I figured if my family doesn't want me on the show, there's no reason I should keep living with them.
I-I mean, there's no hard feelings, um, I just feel like this is best for me, and this is best for those cancerous dicks.
I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store, and now here I am, stuck eating cereal for dinner with a kid.
Wednesdays are rehearsal days here at Family Guy and the first rehearsal with David Spade appears to be going very well. Uncle Ricky, what are all these strippers doing in our house? Uh... each other?
You know, now that I'm not tied down by the show, it's given me more time to pursue my true passion: weaving sexually explicit tapestries featuring the Minions.
Thursdays at Family Guy are reserved for shooting all those flashbacks and cutaway gags we love so much, and what most people don't know is that all these gags are directed by James Cameron.
You know, many viewers think our cutaways are just whipped together, but they actually go through a rigorous testing process before filming.
I believe that's still seasonal, but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid, and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.
Now do you want to leave the regular way, or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?
Well, this seems like a really cheery place, and looks like some guy named Brooks was here, and I think this is gonna work out just great.
Of course I miss my family but everything comes to an end eventually, a-and you just... you just got to keep moving forward.
I-in fact, I was just about to melt some cheese on chips if you want to stay for a sad, single guy dinner.
I'm especially going to miss the Fat Man's bit with the audience where he fires the T-shirt cannon at his own head.
And with regard to Peter's replacement, well, as his parents and previous co-stars have learned, a little of David Spade goes a long way.
Meanwhile, Peter has wound up here at the Chinese Theatre, where panhandlers dress up like iconic movie characters and charge tourists for photos.
Well, I suppose, you could come inside if you had an idea for a show the heads of the network wanted to buy.
Bumblr with a Tumblr eventually aired as Bamblr with a Famblr, which made sense to nobody and is now in its third season.
I've been a real jerk... to you guys, and to all the union fat asses that I assume do something to keep this thing going.
The fact is, I got too big for my britches, but I know now that I'm nothing without all of you.
Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand, and if you guys can find it in your hearts to take me back, well, then I promise that every day I'll prove to you how much the show, and how much my family, means to me.
I'm James Woods, and we'll close tonight with a supercut of every time in the show's history that Peter got hit in the crotch with a bag of nickels.
Oh, it's easy. You and I will just make a video about how sad you are and put it online.
Stewie, I didn't want to do all that fancy stuff, so I just did a video of me speaking from the heart.
You know, telling her how much it would mean if a girl like her went to homecoming with a guy like me.
Our top story tonight, pop star Taylor Swift is coming to Quahog to attend a dance with local high-schooler Chris Griffin.
I hope you don't mind I made the band pay me a royalty for each of my songs they played.
I ruin relationships with nice guys and John Mayer just so I can write songs about heartbreak and moving on.
Now, one of these has the iocane powder, you see, and one of them makes you go sleepy-bye with your mouth open.
This next song is about my dumb ex-boyfriend, who either mistreated me, cheated on me or went to massage parlors when I was out of town.
Well, kids, your father may have gotten beat up, but Uber's still a great job for anyone afraid to sell their blood.
Didn't have time for him tonight, but let's see if we can get him back next week when Amanda Peet will be here with stand-up Dom Irrera.
Well, as everyone knows, bats watch a ton of Cinemax softcore porn, so that seems like the place to start.
I moved onto his prayer farm with 45 other members of the Salvation Star Boys, who died in a mass suicide.
The only reason they work is that if a critical mass of society gets immunized, then the diseases won't spread.
Look, Brian, I was skeptical, too, but then I did some research and I found some very interesting things from the leader of the anti-vaccination movement,
Parents of Quahog and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch, do you know that the number of childhood vaccines has tripled in the last generation?
Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog have dropped to an all-time low, fueled by a recent media campaign led by local meddler, Peter Griffin, shown here in the basket of Henry Thomas' bicycle.
So we're all there at the Clam, just kind of making music together, and then Peter, of course, had to join in and clap his hands, and I said, Eh, that's enough of that.
Well, I actually drove my car into this rich guy's house, and he locked me in here until the police come.
Anyway, I've got some time to kill before this room is filled with tear gas, so I thought, Why not finally read some of the classics I never read in high school.
It was my first summer staying at the shore, but I had a feeling that I, Nick The Situation Carraway, would fit right in.
Um, I hate to break it to you, but that light you've been looking at is a gay gym called The Pump House.
You know, one of the best parts of having an enormous mansion is being able to come out here and get some fresh air.
So I thought I would have you over to my equally large and fancy but imperceptibly more classy mansion for an awkward dinner.
I'm saying I invited you over and sat you next to my wife to say, Stay away from my wife!
But I sure do enjoy driving your car instead of you driving it, even though we came in a different car.
I would soon return to New York a changed man, because, for me, that will always be the summer that I finally put my head underwater.
But I wasn't gonna tell Huck, 'cause he claimed he didn't see me hook-shot that apple core into the garbage from way far away.
We're going to open a bed-and-breakfast in the country, and we won't be afraid to let our guests know that we are Steelers fans in this house.
Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies, and I thought, since you're covered with feces and I barely know you,
All right, evidently I have to go to the big tree on the edge of town to take care of something.
I'm sorry, George, I didn't mean to kill the girl, and now the whole town's gonna hang me by a rope.
All right, so the B&B will have a rack of single-gear bikes for every guest, and yes, next to that, of course, is going to be the big, giant rabbit hutch.
Are We Talking About Jake Gyllenhaal or Jared Leto? I am oily-haired with dinner-plate eyes. I was in that one movie about the weirdo. I somehow look both deathly ill and ripped. I am a less successful version of Tobey Maguire.
You got to constantly tell everybody what a good idea it is, and how important it is, and how wrong they are for having traditional desks.
But sir, if word got out about this, it'd be one of the most notorious developments in beer history, second only to Michelob Ultra Dragon Fruit Peach.
Peter, another way to impress your Asian Tiger Mom is to put on this old-fashioned baseball hat and assist Indiana Jones on his next adventure.
I ordered the brewery to start making beer cans out of toxic, unsafe metal, just to save a few bucks.
It's like, one day she's my Tiger Mom, and the next day she isn't, and the day before that first day, she also wasn't.
You and I will go to the local Emmys, and we'll embarrass Tricia on her big night in front of all her peers.
'Cause people need to know that she's an even bigger fraud than Robert Baden Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts.
Well, what if I said we'd both be wearing shorts and neckerchiefs, and I'd give him little patches for doing what I say?
I took him to the ER and he said he'd pass me if I picked him up in an hour.
Okay. All Tricia's got to do now is take one sip and she'll blow it out of all three holes, right here in front of everyone.
You know, I just been thinking, the way you and me fell so fast for this lady, and for no reason?
Too many pansy-ass parents sue the city when their kids sprain a finger or crush their skull on a bumper.
Yeah, I know. It's just I got roped into going to some stupid office Christmas party with this girl I'm dating.
All right, look, I've been crashing office Christmas parties for the free booze and drunk women who don't want to spend the holidays alone.
Now, Chris, you're getting older, so it's time for you to learn the classic pool party game Talk to Somebody's Wife in a Bikini
I'm sorry, sir. This may shock you, but it turns out the seasonal Santa we hired has a drinking problem.
And I want a tricycle and a pony and an American Girl doll and a drone with a camera and a gun that fires...
All right, now we're gonna go to your home and wait for you to pass it, and then you're gonna eat it again.
Unfortunately, since people only use printers now to print out boarding passes for their grandparents, be laid off as of Monday.
I've been trying to reduce our staff costs for months, but just didn't have the guts to do it, much less before Christmas.
You spread so much joy and wonder to kids everywhere, and I just used that to get stuff for myself.
Okay, guys, this is the original Levi Jeans factory, created by Levi Strauss in the year 1853 so that gold miners could wear a comfortable yet durable fabric.
I go inside, magically go back in time, and then come out and react to the fact that we're flying.
Screw you guys. You know, being a pilot is hard work. Look, I tried to be nice and take you fellas on a free trip, and all you can do is crap all over my job.
Do you really want to know, or are you just asking because we're gonna be on a plane for a while and you think you should make small talk?
Coming up on the midday news, a couple in their 30s gets married without their dog being in the wedding.
Excuse me, I'd just like to ask the mom behind me who told me to stop watching Game of Thrones on my laptop if I'm still the worst person on this plane.
There's over 150 passengers back there, several of whom are in our Commander's Club, and to them I'd like to issue a special welcome.
You're right, it does. There's even an impatient businessman who really wants to reach his destination so he can conduct more business.
Attention, passengers, I know we're being hijacked, but I would be remiss if I didn't point out that we're presently passing over Yosemite National Park.
And now I can finally get into the cockpit and execute our plan: crashing this plane into the ultimate symbol of American materialism,
I know I crap on you a lot, but sometimes, when I'm driving, I think about stuff you say and I laugh.
Dad, I was really worried, so I pulled a record of your credit card purchases in San Francisco, and I saw some things
Okay, once again, nothing is happening on Homeland, but over on Masters of Sex, Lizzie Caplan is hooked up to electrodes and getting it from a guy who sounds American, but probably isn't.
Hey, we're gonna split the screens now because my producer is telling me on Game of Thrones we got a malnourished Albino plowing a girl in a tub as he names dragons.
Last time we went to that, we lost a lot of subscribers, and we're keeping an eye on The Knick.
Eh, the airline's making us all attend a seminar about what do to if someone flies a drone into your flight path.
I wanted to bring over something to welcome Gronk to the neighborhood. So I scraped all the cool ranch off of 15 bags of Doritos.
I'm gonna lay down these work blueprints on the floor and I sure hope you don't walk across them with muddy paws.
Workout room, kegerator cellar, another workout room, and over here's a room that's just got a lit candle on a bale of hay.
When you know you have single coverage, do you give a hand signal to Brady, or is it just eye contact?
Well, no, I ask because sometimes you're being covered by a little guy, and then you and Brady'll look at each other and...
All right, since we sold out so fast, we've got to make these bees more productive, get them to make more honey.
Gronk went to the University of Arizona, and everyone who went to the University of Arizona believes leprechauns are real.
Rob Gronkowski has been suspended from the Patriots following a failed drug test that showed evidence of steroids in his system.
Hey, you know what, guys? This right here, this rambling, boring conversation containing already-made-before observations, this could be a podcast.
We got the equipment and the perfect business plan... give our show away for free, and tell no one how to find it.
All right, tell you what I'd do, I'd back into a bathroom stall, and just start kickin'. Dead! Dead! Dead!
Look... I even brought Tom Sizemore's Game of Life. Sell rights to Saving Private Ryan residuals to buy a case of Coors Light. Steal your son's wallet while he's in the shower. Miss audition. Scoop someone's urine from Starbucks toilet to pass drug test.
I carried you as long as I could, but Rob Kardashian's gonna be at this thing, so I got to be at my best.
And now, two football players are going to do something that only makes sense to the rest of the football team.
Yes, hard to believe a place where you eat with your hands next to piles of horse dung while untrained theater students fight with real swords could be drowning in lawsuits.
Due to the presence of black mold, discarded half-eaten turkey legs, and an undulating rat king that no one dares approach,
Do I hear an opening bid for this majestic fiberglass castle facade, masking what was once a Midas Muffler shop?
I checked with my mom, and she said it was cool with her if we wanted to sleep here tonight.
All right, this says if we don't get arrested for the next six months, the arson and mayhem charges will be dropped.
Oh, yeah, I've been working on that. I wrote several long paragraphs describing my interests, some pet peeves, choice of wine, a couple of inspirational quotes, things I've learned from my cats...
Okay, it says Hey, and then a kissy face, and then, like, a saucy, smirking face, three balloons, and a locomotive.
Yes, is it possible to get Showtime for free for the next, like, two hours to see if I like it?
No. Look, I'm not trying to pick you up, it just seemed like you were upset about something, and I know when I'm upset, it's nice to let someone else in.
Give up on your attempt to convince real Quagmire to not use Tinder, and to instead have sex with this woman who's right in front of him.
And all it took was for us to hire that $200 dirty prostitute to pretend to be a nice lady in a bar.
Come on, Stewie, are you still hung up about that woman at the grocery store thinking you were a girl?
That's weird phrasing, but I'll tell you this, Swanson, you keep up this kind of work, there'll be no more grocery runs for you.
You know, I was just thinking about how much fun we had the other day, and wondered if you'd want to join me for another ride-along.
But first, earlier today at city hall, the mayor honored a hero cop who has foiled a string of recent crimes.
Good afternoon, we had a budget meeting that ran long, so I'm gonna eat my lunch while I hold this press conference.
Okay, while the dressing does its magic, let's honor Officer Joe Swanson, who single-handedly cut crime in Quahog by 75%.
I mean, he can come out for limp handshakes at the end of the game, but I can't play him. He's too little. Little?
Oh, great. Now I'm gonna go ahead and brood over a photo of the girl whose case was the one I couldn't solve.
Oh, I see. You need me to be the bad cop who kicks all the ass and then I'm supposed to be quiet about it?
Yeah? Well, maybe I accidentally reveal that you're not the hero everyone thinks you are and that you've been letting your neighbor do all kinds of cop stuff.
Well, on TV if somebody gets hit on the head, you hit them a second time and that gets them back to normal.
Wow. I guess I just got ground down by years of people treating me like an errand boy, and I just let them walk all over me.
You know, you were a real pain in the butt as a partner, but you helped me find myself again.
Excuse me, do you have any Tab soda I can bring back to the sex dungeon where I've been held captive for decades?
And if you love the golden year of movies, 2003, then we might have some of what you're looking for.
That's www dot, the word double-u three times, the word dot, PBS, the word dot again, the word com, dot com.
I went to Whole Foods today and got this recipe from an extremely thin man with a giant Adam's apple.
Okay, now, last year we were tricked by a couch on a dolly with wheels, so if any of you is a couch on a dolly with wheels,
We watched Tyler Perry's Food Kills, which is the same movie except it stars black folks you've never heard of and white folks you don't hear from anymore.
This, Lois, is my new food truck, specializing in all the delicious, unhealthy foods that you won't let me eat.
'Cause you don't let me eat what I want to eat and that... and, uh, I am super dizzy and there might be a gas leak in this thing.
Look, I'm happy for the business, but drinking that on your knees is... it's putting a hat on a hat.
I mean, you can eat sprouts and vegan crap your entire life and still get devoured by Gremlins and-and-and none of it matters.
This season we're brought to you by Barry's Note Cards. When you need to remind yourself of the sponsor, use Barry's Note Cards.
'Cause I watched how rough it was out there the other day, and I got a little worried for you.
And I'm not going back in that house and listen to Lois tell me how fat and unhealthy I am.
We said we're gonna stand in our front yards and wave as it goes by so we're on the street view.
I finally felt like I was good at something, I made friends... but seeing you like this, I realize you were right.
I think she did all right, but no one will know for sure because halfway through everyone stopped to watch some fat kid who was killing it on Dance Dance Revolution.
Tom, I'm standing here outside a Spooner Street home, where a local business owner has apparently eaten himself into his own food truck.
Oh, yeah, the winner and a friend get to hang out and practice with retired Red Sox players and then play in a real game, right on the field at Fenway.
Guys, look, I know you all want to go, but I-i need a little more time to figure this out.
Okay, now you heard mom say I'm in charge, so I just want to lay a few ground rules. Yeah.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go lick the foot of a fleshy, pale woman for real sex 34.
Rupert, what do you think of this fan fiction I wrote? Diego pressed Dora against the wall, her bosom heaving, her hot Latina breath on his face.
Okay, Lois, catch the ball, and if your foot comes off the bag, just tag Peter on any part of his body.
You know what I'm getting sick of saying? My husband did this to me, but it's not what you think.
And I was excited that for one weekend, if I could just step on that field and get a hit at Fenway park,
Uh, your father broke my leg out of jealousy, but that didn't ruin our honeymoon, and it's not gonna ruin this.
So listen, I want all you guys to drive up to Boston this afternoon to see your father play in the big game.
Who, Meg? - Yes, yes, Meg. She's scary and mean, and I don't ever want her to be in charge of me.
'cause I was too embarrassed to get nude in the locker room, so I'm wearing all this over long pajamas.
I ran like a champion that day, pushing through the pain of two torn hamstrings and a ruptured groin, to leg out the hit at Fenway park
But nobody noticed, 'cause the account manager from B of a who was playing third base had a massive coronary trying to field my crappy little nubber.
The hit was amazing, but what made it even better was that my family was there to share the moment with me.
Every kid in school had to write a list of five reasons Principal Shepherd is cool and then have their parents sign it.
James Woods High will be hosting a cross-country meet, which also happens to be where Lorraine has threatened to take my children, across the country.
And then, the next night, he invited the watching guy to be in the front row of his concert so he could sing it right to him and they could arrest the guy!
Students, faculty and staff of James Woods High, does anyone know how to push down the backseat of a Highlander?
Oh, also, please rub the H and the C off all the knobs, so people won't know what the hell's going on.
I know a number of our students have felt traumatized by the events of this week, and we take those concerns very seriously.
Therefore, the board is seeking a parent volunteer to serve as interim principal until a permanent replacement can be found.
Hey, Lois, maybe I should do it. I've always wanted a job where I can let my dandruff go wild.
You see, if our guests insist on bringing prostitutes into our B and B, we might as well provide the women, too.
I'm sure. The answer is no, so don't bother flashing a wad of money, because there's no way I'm gonna change my answer in the middle of this sentence...
There's gonna be some changes around here, and what better way to show you I'm serious than to smash a desk with a baseball bat?
The four of us got together last night, and we came up with a list of 11 students and two teachers that you need to do something about.
He wouldn't kiss Ruth at the Sadie Hawkins dance, even though she bought him dinner before at Walt's Roast Beef.
All right, ladies, I'm going to put this as gently as I can, but it appears that someone's rectum fell out on the stairs.
But let's just agree on a rule that if your rectum falls out on the stairs, it's on you to pick it up.
Huh. Well, I got to admit I was skeptical, but it sounds like things are going pretty well down there.
We just realized we can keep all the money, take your house, and kill you if you try to do anything about it.
Yes, but then I went on a sex trip to Thailand, and I banged all the goofy right out of me.
I saw Lady and the Tramp, so I asked if we could eat spaghetti in the alley, but they said no, because of all the homeless masturbation.
You are? Listen, this is probably lame, but I learned a little bit of your language, and I just wanted to say...
Look, I can see why you're concerned that Chris' girlfriend has kids, but he's happy, and she seems like she's into him.
I wish I could, but she works seven days a week, between housekeeping and being the new CEO of Yahoo.
I realize that, but you have just as much right to a decent life for your children as anyone else.
Hey, just a heads-up, my dad's friend, Mr. Quagmire, is gonna say a lot of stuff to you, and it's all gonna be disgusting.
With just a few clicks, you'll be able to send someone 14 pounds of unwanted decorative produce that will go bad within an hour of arrival!
Tonight, Madam Secretary faces an international crisis in Pakistan, while her teenage daughter faces her own crisis finding a date for the prom.
You know, where-where I just lie there and arch my hips a little bit and breathe like a dying whale?
Yeah, I'd-I'd almost forgotten about it, but then last night, I get this call from a woman who says she's my daughter.
I'm sorry I tricked you, but if you do have a child out there, isn't it only fair to let him or her meet you?
Yeah, I hope you don't mind the drop-in, but the, uh, the sperm bank said it was okay to contact you.
You always say that, and I'm the one who ends up feeding him and walking him and doing all the clean up.
Anyway, we didn't really get a chance to finish our conversation yesterday, and I thought maybe we could grab some lunch together.
I don't know, he's just so sweet and fun-loving, and for God's sake, he looks just like Peter did when he was his age.
Look, I feel awful about it, but I told Larry that was it, and we couldn't be anything more than friends.
For God's sakes, when push came to shove, you stood toe-to-toe with a much younger man and fought for me.
At our age, all I'm really looking for in a husband is someone who wants to watch TV with me on a Saturday night and isn't afraid to pop a zit on my back. Afraid? I love doing that.
I've made plans to undergo surgery so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.
Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line with more emotion and less of a monotone than the actual Lily on Modern Family.
I'm now confident enough to share my truth with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son, Chris.
Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough that you were able to get me to do this.
How are we ever gonna pay all these bills that have been perfectly ripped across the top so the words past due are visible?
I'm going to gradually talk quieter, as if I'm growing distant to show how overwhelmed you are by this news.
When it comes to selling drugs, you and me will be a better team than the old lady's eyeballs on Downton Abbey.
You got to kill a kid at least once a season to make people go, Oh, I can't believe they killed a kid.
'cause the doctor said I had the cancer... and I killed the guys, and Joe took all the mon... the money!
Now take off all your clothes so we don't get blood on 'em... when we kill that cop in the desert.
Like all television viewers, our first priority before deciding to continue watching a show should be whether or not it features enough diversity.
Would you mind reading it out loud for maximum old-timey effect? To P. Griffin, from the Emmy Board of Governors.
All right, now, a lot of these scenes are gonna be you interacting with someone else, so I'll just come around and read with you.
And there you have it, Family Guy reaches a new low as it grovels and begs for a meaningless award.
I would say they've got about as much chance of winning an Emmy as the Republican Party has of accomplishing something.
Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons: first, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch, and second, to tell you that
To convey this moment of shock at the depth of the conspiracy around me, here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie Tough Guys Don't Dance.
It's like there's some kind of secret society that takes all the awards and is keepin' us from getting one.
And worst of all, you take this big pile of garbage, and you tie it all up by having everyone sit around saying, At least everything's back to normal, as if something happened.
Ugh. You know, later we're going to have to take one of those forced happiness family photos that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.
How about a telephone that's made of vintage phone book paper and doesn't make or receive phone calls or work in any way?
Hey, look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed by us and you think we're losers, well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either.
Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something, I go all the way, like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.
It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm about to thread the needle to prove to you guys how sorry I am and that I'd do anything to win you back.
And if something goes wrong and I don't survive, you can go ahead and delete the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.
Look, you really treated us badly, but the fact that you'd be willing to literally risk your life just to show us how much you care, well, that says a lot.
If being cool means don't get to hang out with you guys, then I don't ever want to be cool.
Under parody law, in order to use someone else's character in an unlicensed fashion, we have to provide something called commentary.
Eh, it could be fun. And we haven't been on a date since I broke the Guinness record for longest nasal exhale at that Tina Fey movie.
It is actually funny. At least three times an episode we turn to each other and we say, That's just like us!
That-That's what any guy wants, the same gal again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, and again.
Really? Let's go knock on the door of the next room and ask them which one of us is fat.
I was wondering if you'd let me take you out for a feast of Indian food, followed by some blow-off-to-the-side curry burps?
Well, first I drank a Four Loko, and then I rode my bike down to the hair salon and shouted Nope! at all the women who came out.
Excuse me, sir, would you like to buy some candy to send Jewish kids to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?
Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass, so get your pants off and put a towel on the kitchen table!
Of the countless directors we contacted, three did not say no immediately, and I got a weird message from Paul Verhoeven that I could not understand.
I'm still here in front of the Hollywood Sign, but I've asked the cameraman to adjust the shot so that you can only see wood.
Anyway, our next director is Wes Anderson, a guy who makes you feel like you ate a pot brownie and woke up in a greeting card.
On a March day, with a temperature of 64 degrees, my father lost his position with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company, near our village in central Quahogia.
We lived in a New England cottage that was inside a vintage Army tent, that was inside a decommissioned submarine, that was all inside an old airplane hangar.
I've summoned you all and arranged you in a perfectly symmetrical form in front of me to tell you some important news.
My father passed away in the spring of his 43rd year, and was put to rest in the family graveyard.
On this very spot, 52 years ago, a piece of beef jerky was planted in the ground and watered with Red Bull.
According to our sources, the search is underway for a man strong enough to throw a keg with enough force to save the Seven Wonders of the World.
Look, Peter, I didn't want to ask you to do this because of that maverick but awesome thing you did in the battle war of the past.
I never got to repeat to him the line he said to me earlier in the film that has taken on new meaning in the context of all that has happened.
Today is the day we honor the late Peter Griffin, the hero who saved the Seven Wonders of the World.
Maybe we just talk here for a little bit, and then you can tell everyone that I functioned as I should.
I'm just saying we should go to the library at Quahog University and take your education to a higher level.
And last week, a professor told his class to have a nice day, which is microaggression, because in our systemic rape culture no day is a nice day.
Oh, yeah? Someone needs to tell Donald Trump it's not fashionable to wear orange on your face after Labor Day.
I can't turn on my phone without strangers telling me to kill myself or that they're gonna kill my family.
But an off-color tweet suddenly made Brian a pariah to all of Quahog, forcing the family to make the difficult choice of sending him to a crappy apartment on the other side of town.
We haven't talked since I moved out, so I figured, you know, 10:00, you're probably on the couch watching Pawn Stars.
Hi. We're concerned that many of you Family Guy fans under 40 didn't get that reference, so I'm gonna take you through the actual commercial.
See... All right, now, what I don't get is, if they know this guy, why are they surprised by the way he talks? Right?
So, watch out, or you might end up in one of my scripts. Martha, gorgeous, headstrong, legs as long as spaghetti noodles, enters.
You know, as someone who doesn't read the paper or listen to the news, you're not such a bad guy.
To show there are no hard feelings, anyone want to go to strip club and look at some cat emojis with me?
I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to tell anyone about what happened, and... maybe we could get that drink tomorrow.
Lou, I like you a lot, but I-I think that's the last tape of you having sex with your girlfriend I want to see.
Hey, listen, you-you don't think... you don't think you could snag a couple of rolls of toilet paper, could you?
Yeah. We were hanging out in the woods, and... this one girl pushed another girl over while she was peeing.
If you want to stop by. There's gonna be pizza and soft drinks, then a man's gonna talk about the whole line.
You don't have a care in the world, and if all of it came to an end right then and there, so be it.
I got a little bit of juice left, so we can either A, call someone, maybe they answer, maybe they can help, or B, we can definitely switch faces.
Brian, a lot of people live in this building, and you can't tell it's a principal just from a walk.
Nothing reminds you more of what you have than watching a grown man poo right through the split in his pants.
You know, two days ago, I was at the donut shop, and I said, Hey, donut guy, you got anything warm back there?
Well, I suppose I better get out of here before that overenthusiastic group of carolers makes their way in here.
Then I need you to get the eggnog cups out of the attic and bump your head on a low eave.
After that, take my cousins to the airport and pick up my other cousins at a different, farther away airport.
And no matter what you show me, there's no way my family won't be right back here spending Christmas with me tomorrow!
Look, I haven't watered my Christmas tree for a few weeks now, so could you watch your really long cigarette, please?
Yes, Lois, I'm here, all loaded up with Christmas spirit and a sack full of hastily bought gifts from the CVS.
And he comes every Valentine's Day on-on a-a... a purple Vespa to, um... to bring candy and sweet notes to children who've managed to not use any swears in the last year.
Plus, he-he wears a Cat in the Hat hat and sometimes a scarf, no matter what Lois says because it gives him a youthful vibe and adds some color to his face.
Donna and I are spending our Valentine's Day in Johnnie Cochran pajamas, just caressing each other in a very beige bedroom.
I go down to the video store and put my hand on Love Actually at the same time as a woman, and I go, Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Uh, I got this small cut, and they wanted to bandage it so I'd stop chewing the crap out of my foot.
And it's so great dating someone who understands why it's especially important to walk around in a circle many, many times before lying down.
You know, I-I know they're not supposed to be that bright, but that was, that was pretty genius, you know?
I mean, leave it, leave it to a Polack to just grab the paint with his hands and just start chucking it everywhere.
I mean, I... God, I-I bet every time you go snaffling on it, you have to stop and admire it.
Nancy, will you make me the happiest man in the world by turning a blind eye to the AIDS crisis and ineffectually trying to warn young people about drugs?
I smell the poop on your breath, and then that's all I want, but my owners made an arrangement with the organizers of the next dog show.
All right Brian, now if we're going to get you ready to compete in that dog show, we've got a lot of training to cover.
You click it when you want me to do a trick, and then I get a treat, so I associate the two.
Uh, you know, I... You-you just made dog shows sound so fun the other day, I-I thought I'd give it a try.
Valentine's Day would take on new meaning for Chris in the years to come, but he would remember none so bittersweetly as this one.
Because this thing is gonna come down to the arbitrary whims of whatever elderly volunteers were able to get transportation here on a Tuesday.
Okay, we're at the part where he bites down on the back of my neck, so we should probably wrap this up.
Someone said they were going to get me eight on Blu-ray for my birthday, and someone got me a limited edition
Like Africa and Asia had sex while Europe sat on a chair in the corner of the hotel room and watched.
We just missed the scene where half the team steals a tank while the other half pretends to be a DJ for some reason.
He was the most important thing in my life, and you willfully violated the sanctity and trust of our friendship when you destroyed him!
And one day, all too soon, I'm gonna be crying at your funeral in an Armani suit, and people are gonna be like, Oh, nice suit, and I'm gonna be like, Why are you talking about my awesome $2,000 suit... my friend's dead!
Stewie... and I are both... incredibly grateful for all the time we had with you, and we wouldn't change a single moment.
Not quite large enough to raise eyebrows while still giving you a younger mind to shape. Oh, you mean you haven't seen All About Eve,
And your office is your haven, since Michael doesn't work and is often at home, perhaps as a result of a low-level depression that you don't really want to get into with him.
Oh, he always planned to have a career, but he could never settle on exactly what it was he wanted to do.
Oh, you have talked about it with other couples, just for show, probably at dinner with younger friends of Michael's who are starting a family, you know, to be part of the conversation, to feel included.
I can see that you went there during summer vacation, which is, in fact, winter in Rio, outside of the high tourist season.
And I see that you're on the rooftop pool deck at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema, the most exclusive hotel in all of Brazil.
Had a friend that went with his older boyfriend, who makes a lot of money in, most likely, banking, much to your chagrin.
You don't go on Airbnb, because you don't trust it, even though Michael has stories of friends who have found the most fabulous places.
But when you take him to the place you're actually staying, the one you found on TripAdvisor that was rated number 27 of all the hotels in Rio and was having a special rate of 295 U.S. dollars a night...
Which is still not cheap, you remind him, most people never get to visit half the places he's seen, you tell him... you can't help but feel like a bit of a failure as you see the look of disappointment on his face as he enters the room.
So you decide to go to the Fasano Hotel for dinner and drinks. No, just drinks, once you've seen the restaurant prices online.
And once there, you can see how Michael begins looking at all the older men who can afford to take their boyfriends... I'm sorry, husbands...
But you tell yourself you're being ridiculous, as you see Michael glancing about the rooftop deck, looking at all the young men, men that would be 20 years younger than even Michael, men that you're invisible to.
But you say, Let's ask someone to take one of us and make some tired joke about selfies that only you laugh at, wishing that you could take it out of the air as soon as you've said it, as it's just one more indicator that you're older than everybody here.
So Michael calls over a young man wearing a tiny swimsuit to take the photo and makes a crude joke that embarrasses you.
To at least give the impression, in your Ralph Lauren shirts, holding your $20 cocktails, that you're both way more successful than you are.
But it makes you feel a little dirty, the lengths you have to go to in order to keep Michael happy.
I try to fit in with the other boys and talk about things like dirt and shapes, but they won't play with me.
I just... I just want to be like everybody else, but nobody's interested in the things that I'm interested in.
And I'm so anxious all the time, but I... I always put on a brave face and try to hide it, and I... I give myself these excruciating migraines.
Some people don't think I talk about it enough anymore, but mind your own beeswax is what I say to them.
I think I'm still the only one in town who's even heard of it, and it's been out for over two years.
And I've even memorized some of the songs, but I have no one to sing it for, and I'm really good.
If you liked Tyler and you wanted to be friends with him, then why did you push him down the stairs?
The accent is-is nothing more than an affectation, a-a coat of armor to get me through the day, just an image I cultivated so I could feel special.
For once, to talk with my real voice without the... the burden of trying to sound like someone I'm not.
I'd like to, really I would, and you were super helpful, and this... this kind of seems like a crummy way to repay you, but... I'm not going to get it.
Sowwy. Eyes, look your last! Arms, take your last embrace. And lips, O, you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss, a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
When I see a man about to go on a sea voyage and not wearing a topcoat, with no watch fob, and whose spats are not fully buttoned...
Well, you see, the children of today are wearing their pantaloons so low, gazoozle, you can see the first three layers of their undergarments, zazzle, zoozle.
There are only two possible explanations: either there's a murderer who has copied the Scottish Brute's methods, or I put the wrong man away.
Oh, I've done enough of that, my friend, especially after that raucous bachelor party trip you threw for me in Las Vegas.
Watson, I don't know how to tell you this... but the murderer we've been looking for... it's your fiancée, Constance.
If she's a murderer from this time period, that means there will be a terrible, pretentious musical about her one day.
Quick, after her. We have to chase her through a series of shots where she has an inconsistent lead on us.
I still don't understand what she meant by he said you'd never figure it out, and... That he'd be victorious.
She arranges for me to kill your imposter... and commits an identical murder so I would come to the inescapable conclusion that I put the wrong man away.
From South Africa to the Suez Canal, from Cyprus to Australia, all of Canada and Grenada, even Antigua and Jamaica.
I don't have time to hear the rest of your sentence, but thank you for being a veteran because you're definitely a veteran.
And I'm sickened by the thought of trolling for free handouts on account of being a vet, much less pretending to be one.
Well, as a veteran, I get to star in a viral YouTube video of me reuniting with my beloved pet.
You know, guys, if being a veteran is about anything, it's about getting half-hearted applause on a Southwest Airlines flight.
You three are in violation of the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to pretend to be a veteran.
You guys seem to have what it takes, so raise your right hand as I recite the Coast Guard pledge. When you're here, you're family.
Affirmative. And, Joe, I order you to just let the binoculars fall right out of your hands, but you don't even notice
I got to have a FaceTime conversation with my wife where we talk at the same time, and then stop, and then start again, then laugh.
I wasn't sentenced, but I came anyway because I thought I could try and teach my friends what it means to serve their country, the way I did.
We should probably all go urinate together, outdoors, as a group of guys, while wearing backwards baseball caps, per Fort Lauderdale municipal law.
If there's gonna be an attack at spring break, we can't just stand by while people get hurt, or even killed.
Oh, hey, Brian. I was sick of waiting my turn outside the supermarket, so I bought every coin-operated horse in town.
I don't know, Stewie, if you ask me, the stock market's just a rigged game where the top one-percent make out like bandits, and regular people get hurt.
Our top story, an austere monetary policy has the European Union on the brink of collapse, threatening the entire global economy.
Tell you what, give me a hundred bucks to put in the stock market, and I'll take care of it.
Brian, there's a 22-year-old Mongolian heiress who's being held captive in a mountain fortress that happens to have a pommel horse in it.
Now that we're eccentric rich guys, we're going to go down 20,000 feet and pants James Cameron while he's excavating the Titanic.
I've been pretty cool about this so far, it's a gentlemen's game. In what country can you find the monuments called...
Excellent choice. You know, not to tell tales out of school, but I sucked my first jug to this song.
Well, I guess all we can do now is the honorable thing: make realistic puppets of ourselves to leave in the bar for Jerome to beat the crap out of.
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin, and I'm here at The Museum of Television & Radio to commemorate Family Guy becoming the longest-running show in television history.
Our top story this evening, songsmith Elvis Presley will be appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show this Sunday night on that never-gonna-last fad called television.
Why don't you just buy a TV for the weekend, watch Elvis, and then return it on Monday and say it doesn't work?
I don't want to go to work in soft underpants like some Nancy boy; I want to go to work like this.
Instead of eating in another room and talking, what if we bring the food out here and never talk again?
Try Post Raisin Bran, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
When you eat Raisin Bran, it fills your stomach and keeps you from feeling the sensation of hunger. Hunger being pangs in the belly as a result of lack of nourishment, thereby sending signals to your brain telling you, Hey, I'm hungry.
Again, made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time; and bran, the hard outer layers of cereal grain.
It's made with raisins, which are grapes that have been dried in the sun for a long period of time.
So, if you see news reports about a Roy Mitchell from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
So, if you see any news reports about an actor named Robert Reed from three towns over who was accused of all sorts of nonsense and left in a hurry, it's got nothing to do with me, because, again, I'm...
Then you can grow up like a man, like track and field star Bruce Jenner, the greatest man in the world.
Chris, I see in the paper that Vietnam is still going on, and as a blue collar TV dad, I demand you enlist.
I went to the draft board and told them I was gay, and then got hit by a bus on the walk home.
I know you enjoy staring, like, but you got any good stories I could tell him about how cool 'Nam is?
I got to get him out to there. I thought this war would be fun, you know, just go over there and fight the Donkey Kong.
We were trying to fight the war our way, the way we'd always fought wars, but we were gradually climbing steel beams and ladders, and the Donkey Kong knew that.
And I hope the exhibits here at The Museum of Television & Radio don't come to life like Night at the Museum.
All right, let me squinch my face up and put on a pair of glasses I never wear to look at these directions.
You see? Right there, this device is a perfect example of how we continue to become more inept due to our dependency upon machines.
He also said, No, thanks, every hot woman, I'll take this woman crawling out of the well from The Ring who none of my friends like.
I'm just gonna lie down on the couch with my head on the armrest to accentuate how sad I am.
You know, Brian, if I had... aw... one day in your body, I would give it back to you with a new and improved life.
Still, from time to time, we will have to imitate the other person's voice to fool those who don't know what we've done, which is everyone.
Well, it's a long story, but I was really hoping to come home with a job and a girlfriend today.
Great. Now we need to find an energy source powerful enough to match the electrical surge that swapped the town in the first place.
Now I need you to strap the body swapper on your back and climb to the top of the tower.
And now here comes a text from the guy who doesn't know this is a group text. Nice to meet you, Hammer. Let's have lunch later, and I'll tell you who's gay.
Uh, first I'd like to not thank you for hiring me, because I just expect good things to happen to me without working for them.
What's that? Sorry, I was taking a selfie while shooting a Snapchat while Periscoping that Snapchat while Instagramming latte art while Shazaming The Weekend while streaming Master of None while retweeting George Takei while saying, This wins the Internet! while still being soooo bored.
We've all lost a great friend-slash-barista- slash-deejay- slash-Genius Bar employee- slash-person with a yellow highlighter at the Best Buy exit.
Peter, I hate to do this here, but you were good friends with Hammer, and business at the brewery must go on.
All right, guys, I got to come up with some social media ideas for the brewery. What do ya got?
Well, I guess that could work. But it's just so sad that young people can't pay attention to something longer than six sec...
I want you and your family to visit us here as my guests, so I can find out what the next big thing is.
Now, because you can't stare at your phone anymore, enjoy a disturbingly loud clip of Jimmy Fallon on cab TV.
Tonight, get ready to lose all respect for Al Pacino when I force him to play a game meant for children!
From now on, if you want to tweet something, you do it the old-fashioned way: write it on a piece of paper, staple it to a bird, and throw it out the door.
Oh, no! You pressed in the wrong place, and now you're being sent to the ad's website, which also has additional pop-ups.
We'll just have to roll up our sleeves and do the best we can, like the men who built New York City.
But just remember: we're doing this so that one day, future commuters can be hassled by panhandlers and amateur break-dancers.
I know the answer is no, but is there any chance there's time for the Wizarding World of Harry Potter?
Well, Mr. Griffin, there's no easy way to put this, so I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
Well, I'm looking for a place with good schools, and, because he works in the city, he's looking for an easy commute.
I just came by to thank you for giving me the kick in the pants I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself
Well, Brian, we may not have gotten the $10,000, but it'll be a joy to hear no more Jewish talk for a long while. Brian and Stewie laugh. The image freezes.
I try to tell them it's my dad's old penis, but that, um... that just tends to make it worse.
I don't need you to. I got a thousand dollar credit from Uber Eats 'cause that driver pinched my bottom.
When a fat guy's sweaty skin presses against couch fabric for an extended period of time, the fabric fibers fuse together with the skin.
I work my ass off to bring home the bacon for this family, and all you can say is, We don't want bacon, we want actual money!
Just look down, all right? Just-just look at me, look what I'm doing. All right, see the way I'm twisting it?
We're gonna take the cushions off, unscrew the legs, take the mattress out, and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler.
Well, you had a couch attached to your back, and you fell down the stairs and hit your head pretty hard.
Sometimes, I pull them out just so they think everything is gonna be okay, but then, I put them right back in.
Let me finish. You were Henry, the eighth guy to have sex with Rock Hudson at one of his pool parties.
When I used to ask my mom what God was, she would say, God is love. I always liked that.
Half of it is supposed to fall onto your plate when you squeeze it, and the rest goes onto your shirt.
Yeah, they're saying, Look at the creative guy. Look at King Fuddrucker over there. Usually you put a burger on a tray.
I'm sorry I'll never get a chance to walk you down the aisle... at Costco, to furnish your sad, single-lady apartment.
It's weird. For the first seven days, all I did was create things, but since then, it's just killing, killing, killing.
I'm still recovering from that one thing you did that was so obscene, it couldn't even be described on lame, dying network TV.
There's nothing worse than when you're flipping channels, and you're like, Oh, God, it's Terminal. Don't say it's Terminal. God, what have I done to deserve this?
Did you know that Lois was so moved she called Channel Five to do a profile of me and Jess?
And now get out your tissues, it's a real-life Quahog version of The Fault in Our Stars, the novel and hit movie your gay nephew quotes on Facebook.
Listen, I want to throw you the wildest bachelor party of all time. It's gonna be crazier than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.
I-I was thinking maybe you could move in with me and Jess, because I-I know you'd want to be with her for her final days.
Come on. It was prescribed by a doctor to a guy named John Selvaggio who has a mailbox that he can't see from his front yard.
We can spend the extra money on the big photos of fetuses I hold while I yell at people outside Panera.
Wearing the ring also makes you wear giant khaki shorts with a belt and a lot of keys rattling around in the pockets.
I'm not re what dysplasia is, but I do know you don't often see a Y that far up in a word.
It tastes great and I don't feel violently ill as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs.
Plus, when you wake at night shaking because you haven't had any in three hours, it's so easy to vape more.
Let's face it, this is the most fun we've had since Mom got hooked on coffee and bought that Alpuccino maker.
Technically, that was not my vape pen, but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine.
At last, I shall exact my vengeance and snuff out the miserable flame that has been your life, vile woman.
Grown men who have never had sexual relations fly them over people's houses to try and see something. I don't know.
Peter, I told you I was going to help you, and I'm not leaving until I make good on my promise.
This new you is a bigger surprise than when they're making fun of a celebrity on Saturday Night Live and the real-life celebrity walks in behind them.
So, now that you got me back as a friend, what are all the great things you have planned for us?
And you were such a jealous little bitch that you had to ruin the one friendship I really cared about.
You're just a big jerk and I hate you, and there's nothing you can do to make up for it.
We had a lot of laughs tonight, but let's remember the important thing: you can't put a price on your happiness, which is why I have: it's $6,000.
He was too light for the caterpillar slide, too short for the piñata, and too scared to touch the animals in the petting zoo.
Well, we'll just see who's the bigger man. Brian, sorry I got testy. Let's bury the hatchet. If you're free, I'd love to hear about any new writing projects you're working...
I'm trying to explain that guns are hazardous and unsafe, not have a conversation about a tepid 1990s Canadian sketch group.
All right, let's all take turns looking down the barrel with one eyeball and see if we can figure out what's going on.
All right, Daddy, I know NCIS is on, but I want to watch Real Housewives, unless you tell me not to.
Yeah, Carter. You know, you've always been a real bastard, but I got to say, it's nice to see you turning things around.
Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize that I wasted my whole life caring about money, and I'm not giving up another second.
Look, I know you're upset about losing our inheritance, but when we got married, the first thing I told you is I didn't want Daddy's money.
For the first time in my life, I have a father who's kind and wants to spend time with me.
Why don't we hire a transvestite to pick him up at a bar, then take off her wig at the exact moment of completion?
This is just what she's been saying she wanted: to spend time with her dad and for him to love her.
Um, your show went off the air and you died 30 years ago, so that phrase means very little to me.
That's right, Chris. This family's never shied away from a new challenge, like when I was the spokesman for that perfume, Deschanel Number Five.
That's right, you'll be strutting down Spooner Street in this dental floss macaroni necklace made with Oral-B dental floss and Pasta Barilla.
Me, I like a piece of sourdough on top, piece of sourdough on bottom, and a nice piece of wheat in the middle.
That can wait. I've just looked at some porn, and I need you guys to give me some assisted relief.
Well, this could be a chance for you to help someone else who maybe feels as bad inside as you do.
What do I need school for? Tony Danza never went to school, and he played a guy named Tony on four different TV shows.
It was fine. I'll miss the guys at vocational school, but it is nice to be back where I belong.
The Yule Log Channel just put on another log, and I really like it when the wood goes crack, crack, pop, crack, pop.
Plus, it's a good excuse to put on my winter coat and find items from last year still in the pocket.
Ooh, sticky pennies, a rock-hard Starburst, an appointment card for my next dental appointment that's already come and gone, a ticket stub for a matinee of Interstellar, an unwrapped piece of Dentyne, a yarmulke from when that Jewish guy died, a breath mint from the now-defunct Clorets corporation, printed-out Mapquest directions to Dave & Buster's,
Flintstone vitamin I didn't take 'cause it was Barney, refrigerator magnet from local electrician who is now arrested, and balled up tissues with last year's flu on it.
Meg, it is my duty as a bad father to prove that I can do anything my kids can do.
But he did continue edging, bringing himself to the verge of sexual pleasure, only to stop at the last moment.
But her voice-overs were not reasonably priced, so they turned to me, a guy who sounds like Morgan Freeman, but is not, in fact, Morgan Freeman.
Well, I have to say, you two are the best thing to happen to sports since the New York Knicks finally changed their name.
Hi, I'm pink-eyed Bob Costas, live from our Pyeongchang studios, here to bring you breaking news, and occasionally blink off-synch in an attempt to satisfy my searing eye itchiness.
A U.S. tourist, Peter Griffin, has been apprehended by North Korea and is being held prisoner for what I'm being told is trespassing and doing that thing with your eyes that makes you look Chinese.
Wait, before you kill me, can you at least give me an extra bullet so I can pretend to catch one in my teeth?
I don't know, I'm thinking maybe we can hang out a little bit longer, see what else Korea has to offer... Uh-oh.
Fortunately, tensions caused by this international incident were resolved by the steady hand of Dennis Rodman, who let Kim Jong-un win in a one-on-one basketball game against him, continuously saying, Oop, you got me, in a way that was just convincing enough for Kim to believe.
Okay, Chris, now, if you're gonna learn how to mow a lawn, the first lesson is that you always start by 7:00 a.m., before everyone wakes up, including roosters.
Oh, Admiral, you've been so good to me these past weeks, with my husband gone and me alone to tend to his massive estate.
Plus, helping you helps me forget my own country's troubles and my struggle to save our national flower, the Masdevallia orchid.
The secret, however, is to October in Zurich but in September, to avoid the obnoxious Octobering crowds, saving October for Paris... Novembering there...
It means a lot from a man whose top hat looks suspiciously like an Amazon Echo with a cardboard brim.
Look, there's plenty of money to go around, and I don't know how much more of this I can take, so I'll make a deal with you guys.
If you can help me wrap this up, if you know what I mean... Take her skydiving, something that might, you know, overwhelm her elderly heart...
So, Peter, we've been tasked with making the operations around here run more efficiently, and part of that will involve reassigning people based on their abilities.
So we're gonna put a flag on you, and wherever you go, people will know that's where they put their recyclables.
But due to man's excessive use of fossil fuels, climate change had rendered the iceberg nothing more than a small cube.
We need you to taste test our new varieties of seasonal beers, which will be coming down this conveyor belt.
Also, our delivery truck drivers have to pass an annual drug test, so we'll need you to collect their urine samples.
They'll be coming down this same conveyor belt in similarly colored cups, which you will need to place on this tray.
I doubt any of you can begin to know what it's like to ride someone's coattails, to play second fiddle to some fat idiot, to constantly be setting up someone else's...
Tom, I'm standing here outside some public toilets where dads who are really hurting will be vomiting in front of their still-developing children.
You know, part of me is glad Sarah met Henry, because she and I had a pact that if neither of us was married by 40, we'd get hitched.
Tom, I'm standing here along the parade route where the Hops balloon has just been punctured, and is now raining helium
Okay, guys, now, the murder took place down here in the basement, so it's probably our best shot at finding something.
Sometimes I pretend I'm at the security desk at the mall and everyone at the mall is banging each other.
Using the bathroom. Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop 'em from dunking in the water?
Where do you keep the nets that you put on the bottom of guys' balls to stop them from dunking in the water?
When I'm at a multiracial picnic for some reason, the last thing I want to do is have a stroke.
I can eat potato salad with chuckling strangers with the confidence of someone who knows he's 12% less likely to suffer a stroke recurrence.
I left her for six weeks back in 2009, only to realize I was already too old to bed the type of women that would make such a separation worth it.
So, here we are, grinding it out till onef us has that second stroke that you don't come back from.
I think we should all go investigate the still-unsolved murder of Doris Billingsly, who never did anything but overcook one dinner in March of 1962.
Would you excuse me while I step into another room and celebrate like a girl in a Rom-com who just got good news?
And remember, most drugs are prescribed to you because a hot girl with a rolling suitcase gave your doctor a free pen.
Sure. And for sure this is a real date, and me and the popular kids aren't gonna thrill-kill you tonight.
Peter, fake news is a real problem in this country right now, and I really don't want my husband contributing to it.
Okay, Peter, your main job here is to go in rooms before me to make sure there's no static electricity.
My husband is the son of a felon who went to prison for blackmailing his brother-in-law by entrapping him with a prostitute and then mailing a copy of the tape to his own sister!
Sometimes I wish I could meet someone else whose dad is a fat idiot who once had a hit television show and who, over time, has worn out his welcome.
Meg, I think you'd look amazing in my brand of lifestyle products that are designed to represent a poor person's idea of what a rich person would wear.
When I'm done with you, you'll be pretty enough to marry an Orthodox Jewish son of a felon who's too stupid to get into Harvard the normal way.
And, I got to say, I'm a huge fan of your board game and your beef products and your fraudulent university and...
Meg, you expect us to believe that the president of the United States would grab a woman by her (BLEEP)?
Anyway, my point is, if Peter Griffin gets to be a jerk all the time, then why can't Donald Trump?
We now return to Pirates of the Caribbean, where the sound guy put the microphone too close to Johnny Depp's jangling bracelets.
We are done being mean and insulting, like Donald Trump is. From now on, this family's gonna be nice and supportive.
If you want to learn more about our president, consult the steele dossier, which is all about getting peed on.
Coming up, we interview a man who went a whole Hawaiian vacation without giving a hang loose sign in a picture, and also didn't do the lei joke.
We bought you a cake with the groceries, so it got smashed with a jug of Tide in the car.
I don't know, my-my birthday is just... it's kind of a reminder that I'm now one year closer to death, with nothing to show for my time here.
But deep down, I was disappointed that we took a shot at Allison Janney, just because she can dunk a basketball.
Not just a robot version, Brian, it's like another you, uploaded with your genetic code, your cognitive patterns, and your entire life story. Oh, no, Stewie's time machine broke, and now we are stuck in the history past.
That'll go away. He will evolve as he gathers more and more data. Fire hydrants, images. Fire hydrants, news. Fire hydrants, near me.
It's legitimate memorabilia! Applebee's, Brittany, Quahog. Brittany, Applebee's waitress, blonde. Quahog, Applebee's, Brittany, who is. Blonde waitress, Brittany, Quahog, Applebee's. Brittany Babbit, home address.
Oh, you know, at Applebee's, she's all like, Hi, may I take your order? and at her bedroom window, she's all like, Ah, get out of here.
Yeah, I mean, if you don't want me showing up at your house, don't put a smiley face on my receipt.
Okay, lay out the pieces, find the cockpit, open the glue, take a sniff  and this will be my life now.
No way. You should've thought of that before you committed a victimless crime between consenting adults in a commercial arrangement which also created jobs and contributed tax dollars to the community.
Congratulations, Janine. Also, Joe, we got pictures of you getting a sexual favor a while back, so now you got to drop the charges.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
It's my job to break those word horses and ride them off into the green pastures of prose and poetry.
Because your best is middling, your worst is intolerable, and when you die, the most you'll want written about you is He Was a Good Boy on your tombstone.
We now return to The Talking Talking Dead, the show that talks about the show that talks about The Walking Dead.
Yeah, totally. And that one part of the show where the guy was talking about that one part of the other show and how he didn't see that coming?
I need an aftershow after this aftershow, just to know what I just saw about what I just saw about what I just saw.
In honor of opening day at Fenway Park this weekend, the Red Sox are offering four tickets behind home plate to the person who makes the best Red Sox ad.
Yeah, come to think of it, he did have a friend filming, and he made me eat the first seven bites in front of him, and he didn't charge me anything.
All right, now to have the only exciting thing in the game happen as soon as I turn my back.
Good morning, Peter. We saw the game last night, and, well, we just want you to know that we wholeheartedly support all transgender people.
Peter, before you say anything that might clear all this up, let me tell you about our stellar transgender employee benefit package.
Well, as such, you're entitled to supplemental time off, our on-site masseuse and a $60 gift card from Nordstrom Rack.
I would find out later that when you put your ass in wet cement, you're just sealing it shut forever.
Besides the fact that you're lying to your employers, you're taking advantage of a civil liberty that so many oppressed people have fought their entire lives for.
Oh, I forgot to mention, one of you guys has to be in charge of changing my diaper the whole trip.
Well, I'll turn to you, very sincerely, and I'll look you right in your eyes, and I'll say, Quagmire, I've got poopies.
Now that I'm living as a woman, I can say whatever I want to men and they can't hit me.
Now, Peter, one of the perks of being a woman is that you get to go out and have a white wine, squeak-fart lunch with your friends.
And since the company was paying for your medical care anyway, we fulfilled your letter of medical intent for your sex reassignment surgery.
I guess we'll just have to deal with this, like when Chris won that hundred-dollar scratcher and talked down to everybody.
It would take another eight years before I summoned the courage to kiss him at a backyard barbecue, and from that moment on...
Hey, now that we're all settled at this table, you guys want to move outside 'cause it's such a nice day?
I grew up in the small town of Football, Texas, and from the age of eight, I was mercilessly teased for being different and dressing funny.
I became a war hero and raised a family, but I was dying inside, and the deeper I buried it, the more unhappy I became, and eventually, I even thought of ending my own life.
And my story, to one degree or another, is every transgender person's story, and all those stories are the price of admission to finally feeling at peace with who you are...
Well, I guess it's my turn. Louise lowered her velvet hood, letting loose her flowing red hair. Ignoring her friends' obvious and understandable envy, she confidently approached the mysterious castle. The doors blew open, as if some magical force had been expecting her. Louise belonged here, if only because this is where Horatio called home. Then, through the vegetation, and past the mist that sprinkled her heaving bosom, she saw him. Horatio, with his long, flowing hair blowing in the breeze, his cape fluttering. He had only two loves in his life: his horses and Louise's heaving bosom. He grabbed her tighter than she'd ever been held before. A way in which her husband, Paulter, had not held her since before they were married. Horatio then took Louise by the hand, leading her out to his stables as her bosom heaved. Louise's mind was racing in anticipation of the dirty hay sex that was gonna most definitely happen. As the two lovers entangled into one atop the probably peed-on hay, Louise's bosom heaved. They spent the next 18 minutes fighting off sneezes, in the throes of ecstasy.
Yes, I'd like to enroll in a couple of classes so I can have sex with girls not old enough to get into bars.
Lois is writing a romance novel about a woman who is unhappy with her husband and begins to have a torrid affair with a caped lover who has horses.
I thought we were gonna get a ten-dollar scoop of ice cream with all the millennials who can afford ten-dollar scoops of ice cream but can't afford to move out of their parents' house.
All right, Peter, now, I know you haven't eaten in a while, so this is something called the Pocket Diet.
I thought that you wrote everything you were looking for in a lover, and, if I could embody some of those things, maybe I would have a shot with you.
But then I found out Horatio is real, and-and I couldn't bear to see you do something like this to the family.
Then, thinking I was revealing all my most intimate wants and desires, you thought that you could exploit what you read to seduce me?
But when you thought I might be cheating with someone other than yourself, you found that, and only that, morally objectionable?
Yes, but, you know, I think what we missed in all of this is that Lois wrote a beginning, middle, and end to something.
Well, nothing, but, you know, I think-I think any writer knows how hard it is to be staring at that blank page.
I mean, like, there was palm trees like it was Hawaii, but then there was a suit of armor in the corner.
Billy Finn, John Travolta from one of our cutaways, uh, all of our characters as Star Wars characters, everybody from The Cleveland Show,
Cherry Chevapravatdumrong... that's how that name is pronounced... the Orville... the ship, not the cast... um, me... Aw, damn it!
Damn it, I just want to be home, not here, lost in the woods, looking at this stupid map with a magnifying glass.
Wow, Peter, that was a close call with that fire, but I'm glad you all made it back safe and sound.
Have you ever been at your grandmother's house and you look at her weird, old computer, and there's, like, a crack on the side of it?
Winona Ryder kind of hung out on set all day, and it, uh, wore a little thin on all of us.
Kids, time to gather up our old cords and chargers that no longer work and throw them in the garbage.
You know, I actually had a couple of ad-libs about Chinese working conditions that somehow didn't make it into the final cut.
Peter, I'm just not sure it's such a great idea that everyone in the family got a new cell phone.
Oh, come on, Lois, you only want to go to Old Sturbridge Village 'cause you once got hand-blasted there on a field trip.
Mr. Griffin was able to negotiate a higher salary because he's still paying alimony to his first wife. First wife? What?
Not for real, though. For real, she's actually coming into the booth right now to be part of this commentary.
That's okay. It seems just like when I would do ADR for American Horror Story, for which I have received five Emmy nominations.
Stewie, I'm gonna give you another crack at that, because I believe what you meant to call them was baluster slats, not banister slats. Banister, baluster. Same thing.
PETER: I'll tell you what it is: an homage to a classic song from The Muppet Show, sung by Kermit's nephew, Robin.
Enjoy spending the rest of your life alone, and enjoy doing the show without me, 'cause I quit! building a chair with my male friends.
If you're just joining us, Lois has stormed out and announced that she's quitting the show after learning that Peter and Sarah Paulson were once married.
Hey, remember the one day that guy who plays the burglar was on set, he was passing out postcards for his one-man show?
Um, Ms. Kunis, I would just like you to know that I have no problem with you breastfeeding in this booth.
Oh, Seth, since you're here, would you mind recording episodes 17, 14, 15, 16, and an NFL on Fox promo?
Peter, I-I'm not even sure what this means, but it sure makes it seem less important how much money you make compared to me or that maybe you neglected to tell me everything about your past.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need all the real actors to form a human shield around me so I can get out of the building without the American Dad people seeing me.
The other name for the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, an enormous cluster of man-made debris floating in the middle of the ocean.
STEP ONE: We all go frigging nuts over Yankee Candles, so to help you learn all the flavors, I made a little quiz.
I'm gonna give you a name, and you tell me if it's the name of a Yankee Candle or a porn star.
My plan is to attach six Jimmy Buffett margarita machines to it, which should be able to propel us home.
O-Okay, I-I don't think I can talk to you, because, right now, you're making less sense than an M.C. Escher floor plan.
I thought I was helping you find love, and, instead, you used me as a tool to get down every middle-aged woman's pants in town.
I assumed it unlikely you'd change your mind, so I added the fans from many, many Dell laptops to the back of my Big Wheel so I could simply tow everyone back to land.
We'll be starting the taping in just a few minutes, but I wanted to come out here personally and say hi to my fans.
So I want everyone to go through every single item you own, and if it doesn't kindle joy, throw it away.
You remember when she thought the solution was putting a lemon slice in a plain glass of water for a very simple kind of pleasure?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that clearly says Not legal tender into the mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while I put a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox?
That your parents pay for entirely using autodraft from their account while Chris puts a pretend mortgage coupon that says Not legal tender into Stewie's Sesame Street mailbox while I hold the plastic door open for him?
I tell you to clean your rooms, and the first thing you do is put all your science projects in Stewie's closet?
I'm just, uh... I'm sort of outmatched. It was my fault, not yours. I'm so sorry, and I love you all. Goodbye. P.S. Please throw this note out.
I don't know. Somehow, an idea I got from a two-minute segment on a morning talk show didn't bring me the life satisfaction
Hey, Chris, what's the name of the girl on the end of the couch? I'm sure I've met her before.
Meet disgraced YouTube star Logan Paul and his cool bus, the Golden Throated Homeless Guy and his cool bus he poops in,
Oh, awesome. Look over there. You can take a selfie in a hospital bed to get social media attention. Don't really want to get into it, but I'm fine.
But first, popular Internet star Meg Griffin has Type 2 diabetes, and is also the new face of diabetes drug Pancresta.
If you have a problem with addiction, do not take Pancresta, as smoking Pancresta may mimic the otherworldly high of heroin.
I'm not sure how it works, but I do know you could go blind, you could have organ failure, you could lose your feet.
James Woods High School will also be saluting their own diabetic Internet celebrity with a pep rally in her honor this Thursday.
She passed away last month. She was addicted to Pancresta, so she didn't so much pass away as elevate to a higher level of consciousness.
Beautiful. Now, to unveil our new sign, we've invited HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines, who are here to prove that their show didn't ruin their marriage.
Welcome back, Quahog. And now it's time for a new segment on our show called On the Same Sofa, in which a guest and I have a conversation while sitting on the same sofa.
It's irresponsible for the town to get two credit cards and just swap the balance back and forth each month.
It used to happen a lot in the '70s but doesn't seem to happen that much anymore. to a bygone era when men settled their differences
She writes, Dear Casey, is Christopher Cross as nice as he seems? Also, aren't you dead? And why did your large wife hide your body from your children?
This Sunday, we turn the Quahog Convention Center into a mud pit for the 28th annual Quahog Monster Truck Rally and gun show.
Watch real loud trucks and smell the smoke that reminds you of your dead alcoholic stepdad who you're glad is dead but still miss anyway.
But you just got to give 'em the biggest hug you can and let 'em know that you'll always be there for them.
As much as you want to save your kids from their mistakes, it's their mistakes that help them grow and change and become their best selves.
The fish is for me. And the chicken... the chicken is for my girlfriend, Ida Davis. Girlfriend? Are you sure, Brian?
There are many things I can't go into at this time, but I can confirm that a body was removed from Waldo's apartment this morning.
Listen, Glenn, I know this is an adjustment for you, and you and Brian haven't always seen eye to eye.
You think this moon rock is gonna walk across the room and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams playing Teddy Roosevelt, God rest both their souls?
But you were confused, you'd just gone through a huge change, you didn't know if you had any options, so you settled.
Quagmire, we agreed that it was a two-hand touch, and then Chris hit me with one hand, and I said that didn't count, but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.
Hey, kids, how would you like to hear this on the screen instead of the great show you came to see?
And guy walks quickly away from table without a word, replaced by an older white man with a much younger black woman.
You may think I've always been a part of this high-society world, but I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
Carter, I appreciate you trying to be the man I want, but being back home here has made me realize you already are.
Damn it, Griffin! You've been staring at that menu for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting in a double pee puddle!
My name is Von Jiener, and I'm Vice President of Creative Bankruptcy for the Fox TV network, which, at the time of this writing, is still a thing that exists.
You have been selected to be part of a focus group that could affect one of America's most beloved television shows: Family Guy.
And since Fox is now owned by Disney, which will someday be owned by Netflix, which will someday be owned by Pornhub, we have decided that Family Guy is ready for a reboot.
You know, I just want to say again that you were totally right last night to bring up that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.
Great. I worked out, made dinner, a little family time, and had Peter's ankles up in the air by 11:00.
Now, I know you're all wondering who is going to get the big promotion, and I'm proud to announce that person is Smarmy...
Many recent shows have found success by rebooting themselves as gritty supernatural teen dramas, like Teen Wolf or Riverdale, which are watched by as many as 6,000 people a year, so we thought a similar approach might work for Family Guy.
Also, I'm the town sheriff, but you don't find that out till later because it's not relevant to the story.
I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into and listen to a band that's on a label owned by the same parent company as the network.
Now one of us will become a breakout movie star and leave the series, wrecking it for the rest of us.
What? Course not. And if you're impressed by the size of Alexander Skarsgard's penis, that doesn't make you gay, right?
I know you've been here all day, but it's not like you have jobs to go to, so I'm going to show you one more reboot idea.
Sometimes networks will cancel a show only to reboot it with less-popular characters from the original, while the more-popular actors go on to find greater success in movies or ugly public divorces.
Or should I say, G'day, mate, since you're in Queensland, Australia, where you moved with Brian and Meg after Mom and Dad died?
I don't know. It's just, it's been so hard since Mom and Dad died and Joe moved in with all his big band records.
Well, NBC hogs all the good sports, so we'll get stuck with the boring ones that the announcers always have to keep apologizing for.
Yes. But in fairness, it was the same squirrel who green-lit Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the show that challenged the notion that only attractive people can be on television.
Yeah, the world's better now that corporations read our most private communications and then sell back at us the very things they've eavesdropped about.
Now with the kids showing a complete lack of morals, well, we may all need to go to Christian family camp.
And there's all these people in the van who normally wouldn't know each other in real life: my second grade teacher, my mom, Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.
Then SNL is starting, and I'm clearly in the cast, and I haven't been to any of the rehearsals, and all the cue cards are blank, and that show is all cue cards.
They also ring you up on one of those tablets they flip around at you and then glare while you pick from three inflated tip percentages.
Clever news pun, doesn't really work as I haven't yet mentioned the subject of the story... At Quahog's new cat café.
Remember, history says that Jesus does not look like a traditional man from the Middle East, but rather someone who sells raw milk online.
Now that that cat café is gone, I can finally get back to my favorite bar and do some writing.
Well, apparently, due to some recent public health concerns, the city has said that no animals of any kind are allowed in any public establishment.
So I said, That shirt looks really good on you, and he says, Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me.
It's like, whoa, all I said was I like the shirt, and he has to drop boyfriend like a nuclear bomb?
You know, Vera, I've been so moved by my time here at camp, I wonder if I could perhaps say grace tonight?
Well, Meg, you know Chris is a little bit dumb, and I know you're not particularly popular or beautiful, but you do have a head on your shoulders.
Oh, she was so mad I dragged her to Christian camp, she ran away to live with a Japanese family.
Good evening, Quahog. Our top story: a local Yankee fan's dream comes true when he's diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
Well, it was the 1990s, the decade of Viagra but also Lorena Bobbitt, so it was kind of a yay-boo period for penises.
Okay, well, what would you think if I told you that Blossom would completely drop out of show business to get a PhD in neuroscience and then come back and make $15 million a year, while you would work steadily for 20 years, lose all your hair and go bankrupt?
So I decided I was gonna do the most powerful thing you could do in the '90s: make a mixtape.
Again, Peter, it's your mixtape, but you've got Cotton Eye Joe as song number two, number four, seven and eight.
Oh, Peter, I got to say, the fourth and fifth time I heard Cotton Eye Joe, it really got to me.
We partied the same way everyone in the '90s did, spaced apart by a few feet, dancing on our own.
I planned to, but then I found a half-eaten hot dog that only had a little bit of sand on it.
But then, he came back the next season and scored 30 points in a game where no one would touch him.
We got over our initial differences, and then spent the rest of the day doing what everybody did in the '90s...
Now, listen, we don't have too much time before the wedding, so I want to go over something regarding the father-daughter dance.
If you hate pure, unconditional love and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe, definitely do not try this drug.
I know I screwed up, and I don't deserve you, but I can't stop thinking about you, day and night.
Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome as the guys your dad wants for you, but I love you more than all of 'em put together.
That's a fact. Just as sure as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy, unmarred by additional canon.
We eloped at Fenway Park, which I paid 50 grand to rent out the day before the dot-com bubble burst.
I was having serious regrets about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg, so there was no backing out.
He looks like if Marc Maron had sex with a scarecrow and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.
Lois and I are stocking up for a very special anniversary evening, and I'm not sure that five percent discount was worth checking in here on Facebook.
I bet Greeks will always be known for their advancements in math and not as cartoon characters with very hairy arms and a tragically mismanaged economy.

We'll hide inside it, they'll take it in as a gift, and then we spring out and destroy the city.
Our next love story is Romeo and Juliet, a 500-year-old tale about horny preteens that society somehow decided is classy and not perverted, even though two middle schoolers bang in it. Enjoy.
Well, I wish you would have told me that before, but that's okay, because I do karate outside against no one.
I'm voiding my bowels right now because I died, not 30 minutes ago in the carriage on the way here.
I'm gonna do to you what I did to your bunny and your neighbor's cat because I went to the wrong house the first time.
But they did say they'd give me one minute at the end of the show to share my favorite love story.
Coming this winter: actors who don't look familiar in shows you're pretty sure you've never heard of on networks you've definitely never heard of.
'Cause if you hear any argument from anybody who says it isn't stuck, you send them to me, and I will so karate-chop them in the face!
Jail is just a sleeping deputy with keys that can be grabbed by a long broom handle or a mischievous dog.
Okay, if we want to get arrested, the best way to do it is to get caught on the Ring app stealing people's packages.
But I don't want to die. And it would be nice to have people to go to Smash Mouth concerts with.

Fighting in here amongst ourselves while Brooks is out there waiting for all of us, bagging groceries, adapting to this new world seamlessly...
By the rules of prison and The Love Boat, you've made up, which means you get to leave wiser and happier.
Yes, the movie was originally released in summer, but it took place on Christmas Eve, which makes it a Christmas film.
Meg, there's a lot I have to get done here, so I need you to take Stewie to the mall to meet Santa.
Lady, by the power vested in me by Paul Blart, you are now banned from this mall and every mall in this county.
Turns out, if you're gonna learn how to stop time in wizard school, don't leave class early to be the first in line for lunch.
I didn't leave my family to have sex with a 12-year-old boy named Vili Fualaau, get arrested for rape, give birth to his child in prison, get out, get arrested again for humping him in a car when he was 13, have his second kid in jail, get out, get married to him, change my name to Mary Kay Letourneau-Fualaau, live my life as a disgraced sex offender, and then get dumped by him.
I know some of you kids think this class has nothing to do with your day-to-day lives, but you couldn't be more wrong.
Hey, Lois, I just got an invite for a Facebook group you started called Keep Harriet Tubman Off the 20-Dollar Bill.
Local white girl Connie D'Amico died at the scene of an automobile accident earlier tonight, the brake lines of Connie's Celica apparently cut.

Well, if you get a Casper mattress now, you have a hundred days to decide if it's the right mattress for you.
It-it was... it was nice being held up against a wall, but when you made me suck the hairdryer, I-I...
We're here with local hero Brian Griffin, who recently foiled a robbery at Goldman's Pharmacy, which by the way, is getting its ass kicked by the CVS across the street.
I know it's been a while, but I saw you on TV and I'm just hoping we could get together.
I'm a tech entrepreneur, I've written 11 best-selling books, and I was the NBC executive who suggested we assault the nation with Chicago-themed programming.

You know, I wish I could spend more time with you today, but I'm late for a video conference with
I've always believed I was destined for a life like yours, but something was holding me back, and now I realize it was two things.
Look, Stewie, this is a huge step for me, and if you can't support me, well, then maybe I should cut you out of my life, too.
I thought it might be fun to come by and sell some of my homemade jewelry to your coworkers during lunch.
Two years ago, Bentley's wife made him hang a sign-up sheet to sponsor her in an AIDS walk, and we've hated him ever since.
I took a jewelry-making class last month with a group of preschool moms, and now I'm gonna do it as a career.
I've wanted to cut your balls off for years, but the fact that you're choosing to do it yourself is so much more satisfying.
I read his book. There is no greater motivation than the destruction of an enemy, and my enemy is Brian Griffin. One day, I will convince him to cut off his own balls, and that will be my greatest accomplishment.

Now, let's go to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, so we can be shocked at how well her people age. Tricia?

What the hell is wrong with you? You've been staring at that old man Halloween costume for 30 minutes. but it's a big decision.
Our top story tonight, local baseball coach Peter Griffin took a knee during the national anthem today, joining the fight for equalit.
Doesn't matter if it's me or, say, you who gets applauded for his progressive thinking, as long as the message is out there.
You knelt at one game. It's not like opportunity's gonna come knocking on the door, offering you money for it.
Mr. Griffin, we heard about your protest and we no-heartedly believe that, with your help, we can conflate buying our products with genuine activism.
Don't spend any time with the first two families, make a commitment to family number three, and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party.
Well, Joe, you and I were talking over chopped liver and coffee this morning, and we said it has to start with the run game.

Fibonacci is also a reference to a sequence of numbers where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Hi again. That man over there reading a book by himself has offered to pay for your meal if you move to a table outside.
They have very little control in their lives, so the key, and I mean key... is to make them an active participant in these decisions.
Now the bride and groom would like to share a moment of silence to honor the family members who have passed.
Here. Restore original DNA profile. Yes. Would you like to add a Hemsworth haircut? No. Are you sure? Yes. Really? Yes. Would you like to first see a photo of what you're turning down? No. Too bad.
I know that there's got to be a part of you inside there that can understand me, and maybe Rupert can help you remember.
Those nicknames no longer fly ever since several women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against each of us.
Well, it said it was designed for writers, but when I sat down to work, it just wasn't flowing through me.
Yay Radley, Herman Munster judge, lazy dog who wandered in due to the heat, crazed Al Pacino, old Robert Duvall, young Robert Duvall, in-between Robert Duvall, the books of John Grisham.
The shameless film star who made a movie college kids used to like is again asking people who have less to give him more.
We'll raise the money we need, pay back the store, and then e-mail the backers, saying we ran into trouble and couldn't finish the project.
You see, Mom, we try to stay focused on the task at hand here at Griffin, Griffin, Griffin, Griffin and Griffin.
Hey, Lois. I'm at the small bodega in the living room lobby trying to pick out a new baby card for Janine.

Again, I want to say I'm so glad all of our schedules lined up so we can work together. And, as a reminder, we've got New York on the line.
I'm sitting there at my desk, trying to watch porn on sites you guys haven't figured out yet, and she comes in and kisses me.
Now, Barbara, the reason you are here at Super HR is there's been an accusation of unwanted touching and an overly sexualized work environment.
I got to go crowd the gate so people think I'm in first class, even though I'm in boarding group seven.
Scuse me, is there any way I can get on the plane now, even though I'm in the seat whose back touches the bathroom?

I-I thought maybe your father would show up at the last second and we'd have one of those airport scenes.
But first, tragedy strikes close to home, as a car crash near my apartment claims the life of a local teen girl.
What brings you around at this late hour with your uniform on and your hat held mournfully against your chest?
She got in a car wreck, and was burned beyond recognition, and I leveled up on Fortnite this weekend, but you probably only care about the first two things.
Usually one of the guys would swipe a thing like this, use it on the way home, but I snagged it for ya.
When I was hastily relocated to this parish a week ago, the last thing I thought I'd have to do is stand before you on such a sad occasion.
She'd wrap up both hands like oven mitts and act like she was cleaning out a pot of burnt chili.
Maybe we should just have a moment of silence as we hear the guy down the street scream at his barking dog.
In the case of Kent and Bradley v. Holiday Dongs, the court rules that you must give us the recipe.

Oh, good for you! Soon, the Great Flood came and the ark set sail. Then, like every father on a boat,
Now let's divide it into banks and strips as one normally does with land. Shem and Ham married their mom, while she and Noah remained the best of friends. Noah even danced with Ham at his second marriage to his daughter. Shem and Ham had twins named Phlegm and Yam, who married each other and gave birth to Noah's next daughter-wife.
How about this laminated motel information sheet? Checkout is noon. Must dial nine to reach outside prostitute. In the event of fire, follow the older heavyset lady in just a T-shirt. There are no dining facilities on-site, but guests are encouraged to visit the Applebee's, which is a short walk across the six-lane highway.
You know, that actually reminds me of another Bible story: The Last Supper. It was the week before Easter, and Jesus and Mary Magdalene were dyeing eggs with that cheap messy coloring kit from the drugstore that has those weird paper things that are like costumes for the eggs but never really fit around the eggs...
Like last time, Paul was on his speaker phone, and we were like, Paul, you're up, and he'd be like, I'm what?
Oh, you think so? It was a chicken fight of biblical proportions. And then, there was Easter. Also, pregnant ladies have to have the baby.
Maybe there's one more story we can all learn an important lesson from... oh, oh, it's a whole big toenail.

As a courtesy to the hardworking cast and crew, we ask you to please refrain from looking at your iPad
If your son had been shot, all I could offer is thoughts and prayers, but this calls for a far stronger response.
Also, would it make any sense to put all the beds in one room and make one room a trampoline room?
Who but a witch would not give up her virtue to a man who brought her a luncheon of salt pork and boiled sweets?
Je was watching Je Love Lucy, then je... was wondering why Lucy wasn't talking so much, and then je realized it was just a orange cat in a ashtray.
Just join me one step over here, yet out of earshot, so I can rap your knuckles with a ruler.
Thank you, Your Honor. In my case to prove that Brian Griffin is, in fact, an idiot, and therefore cannot be defamed, I call Brian Griffin to the stand.
Now, Mr. Griffin, I'm going to recite a biography and I'd like you to maintain your composure. On December 1, 1951,
This Sunday, on an all-new Family Guy, the Griffins are grounded and the one actor of color plays a character named Lawnmower Guy.
The game begins. Hey, cutie. Long time, no talk. I'm trapped in Europe and all I have is my bikini.
My name is Peter Griffin, and I get to the in conclusion part of my speech faster than most people.
And can our own 9/11 be, like, one one-thousandth as bad, but we'll still make a fricking movie about it?
Oh, I'm trying to prove that Peter's the one cussing in the house, so I waxed the staircase for him to fall down.
Lois was sad, but not as sad as she was going to be when she realizes she has to use those ouchie wipes to make a potty next to the store dumpster.

I want to get on stage and talk about my husband and how he leaves the toilet seat up, et cetera.
(regular voice): Can I just stick around a little bit so I can go up onstage when you guys win an Emmy?
You know, all of your responses have been very similar, so you might want to nip that in the bud.
Right. Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact, ten minutes later, I'll get a chime notification on my phone, and I can pull up the video.
Excuse me, I'm in Bali on a spiritual journey but I seem to have mistakenly wandered on to the heavy people beach.
And I didn't want to say it because I-I didn't know if you were going to say it back and oh, what a fool I've... Chris!

Now, why don't y'all start by each trying to suck up to me so I can choose who I'm-a side with?
Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story while I share looks with Stewart that say, whoa, this is what you got to deal with?
I's just gonna open up this big book and use the time you're paying for to figure out when you're next available.
When I go back to school, my greaser friends are gonna say, Tell me more, tell me more, and I'm gonna say you were a slut.
Mom, I tried to look at a... lady who was lying with her... straps down and she saw me and she said something to her friend and they laughed!
With nominations looming and Les fired for his predatory behavior, the Boys Alliance of Jeremy and Pablo strategized while Julie stepped down from The Talk to avoid uncomfortable questions, but continues to host this show and spend Les' enormous wealth.
All I know is that we both set up this cutaway at the same time, and now we're inside this cutaway in Australia.
So, you and I set up a cutaway at the same time and that somehow put us in the cutaway?
And it takes a setup from both of us to get us in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.
Lois, are you saying that it takes a setup from both of us to get in or out of CutawayLand but only one of us to move within CutawayLand?

Peter, enough. I know you want to have fun with drugs, but what's the point of drugs if you don't have kids to share 'em with?
This is better than being at home. We make a better team than at home. Worse than at home? The AIDS person is Tom Devanney, which is the name of a Family Guy writer home?
And now, if there are any spiders the size of dinner plates that object to this marriage, please speak now or forever hold your peace.
Joe, shut up. No one cares. Just tell me, are you in the real world, or are you a cutaway?
Well, according to a 16-year-old autistic fan in Akron, Ohio, In order for the Griffins to escape from a theoretical CutawayLand, they must first journey back to the original Family Guy cutaway with Adolf Hitler and kill him.
Well, this is where it gets a little complicated. In order to return to the original cutaway, each family member must...
Yeah, I know he was evil, but do we really have the right to take the life of another human being?
Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather is closing the door in your wife's face while she wonders what's going on inside.
Oh, God, here comes Doug. He just got a race car bed, and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.
Uh, it's a very special day, as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ before she can consent to it or have any conception of what's happening.
