# This program converts a CSV file containing dialogue data from the "Family Guy" TV
#Â show into a text file. It filters out segments with less than 17 words, removes
# duplicate lines, and writes the unique dialogues to the output text file.
# The conversion process ensures that the resulting text file contains only unique
# dialogues with a minimum length of 17 words. Finally, it prints a message indicating
# the successful completion of the conversion process.

    # Read the CSV file
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
    
    # Filter out segments with less than 17 words
    df = df[df["Dialogue"].astype(str).str.split().apply(len) >= 17]
    
    # Extract the "Dialogue" column
    dialogues = df["Dialogue"].astype(str).tolist()  # Convert to string
    
    # Remove duplicate lines
    unique_dialogues = set(dialogues)
    
    # Write the dialogues to a text file
    with open(txt_file, "w") as f:
        for dialogue in unique_dialogues:
            f.write(str(dialogue).strip() + "\n")  # Convert to string before stripping

# Input CSV file and output text file
