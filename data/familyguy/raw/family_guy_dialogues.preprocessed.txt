Only once , but I had just seen <unk> <unk> in Beautiful <unk> , so it was kind of a <unk> .
Those <unk> no longer fly ever since several women came forward with <unk> of sexual <unk> against each of us .
Me , too , Glenn .
God , it &apos;s so amazing that you &apos;ve been my dad &apos;s friend for , like , years , and now we have this connection .
Besides , this will be way more fun than hanging out in <unk> with the wives , sitting around a campfire , listening to Lois tell grocery stories .
Oh , Peter , you should have been there .
Uncle <unk> &apos;s <unk> brown rice was on sale .
It says , <unk> <unk> , four , one , eight , five .

That &apos;s the number , Brian !
<unk> told me I had to kill you because you said we should break up , but I couldn &apos;t bring myself to do it .
<unk> room , <unk> cellar , another workout room , and over here &apos;s a room that &apos;s just got a lit candle on a <unk> of hay .
I finally got something better to do with my <unk> than sit at the mall and watch Japanese girls laugh at normal conversation .
I have made a lot of progress lately .
<unk> one session wouldn &apos;t be the end of the world .
I &apos;ll go to the john and fire one out in five minutes .
That should make room for dinner .
Oh , you know , uh ... that , uh , this <unk> of days is about , uh , <unk> ... our loved ones and , uh , <unk> ... <unk> .
Meg , it &apos;s only because I want to make sure this guy <unk> you right and doesn &apos;t try anything funny .
I &apos;m getting word that the Quahog <unk> Board has just <unk> <unk> Fargas , ending his <unk> teaching career , It &apos;s basically Jaws , except when the guys in the boat are going after Jaws , they look around and there &apos;s an even bigger Jaws , so the guys have to team up with Jaws to get bigger Jaws .
Look , you guys doubted me , <unk> me , constantly <unk> my <unk> despite my clear instructions , and now you want a piece of my treasure ?
Rupert , what do you think of this fan <unk> I wrote ?
<unk> pressed <unk> against the wall , her bosom heaving , her hot <unk> breath on his face .
Neil , you ask me out , like , once a day , and I always give you the same answer .
And I don &apos;t really know how to break it to you , so I &apos;m just going to come right out and say it .
You have no idea where I come from , where I &apos;ve been , how long I &apos;ve been there , what I had to do to get from where I was to where I am now !
I know you are not happy about this , but I am pregnant , and I am having this baby .
Really ?
Is that the one where they make &apos; em dress in the little shorts and hats like the guy in <unk> / <unk> ?
Of course , he always <unk> by Monday , and then he becomes a pain in the ass again .
Our <unk> &apos;s tomorrow .
You need someone to work with , and I need someone to make me look good .
So I turn to Lois and I says , You want to get an abortion here ?
You want to get an abortion with the <unk> having a <unk> hand ?
We can &apos;t get an abortion here .
We have one where some Italian <unk> have laid out every item of clothing they own on all of the <unk> .
But nobody noticed , &apos; cause the account <unk> from B of a who was playing third base had a massive <unk> trying to field my crappy little <unk> .
You see , once connected to this device , you will be able to enter my sleeping mind , where you will end these horrible dreams once and for all .
Now , I &apos;m gonna roll him on his back , but you &apos;re pretty much gonna have to do 100 % of the work .
Then they put me into a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days .
We got invited to a party .
Peter Griffin , you and your family are cordially invited to a gala dinner in your honor at Rocky Point Manor .
Now give me the other half of the <unk> .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be making it to <unk> .
I don &apos;t know if I can take another evening of <unk> eye contact from all the other wives .
Don &apos;t worry .
I don &apos;t need to go to the hospital .
I &apos;ll just use this Mr <unk> Head piece .
Yeah , I totally hit it off with this great guy in the Internet , and we &apos;re finally going to meet .
Well ... honestly , I just thought that maybe I could put something good in the world for a change .
Well , anyway , I &apos;m a pretty corrupt guy so I figured I could sell your figurines and pocket the cash .
There &apos;s over 150 passengers back there , several of whom are in our <unk> &apos;s Club , and to them I &apos;d like to issue a special welcome .
So people will know if they step into my yard , there &apos;s only one way out ... in a body bag ... from dog injuries .
We just got to be patient , Lois , like waiting on the results of a blood test , a real important blood test .
Ground ball to <unk> .
The throw is to second , and again , the ball <unk> past <unk> into right field .
There were these other idiots there having a bachelor party , but I didn &apos;t know &apos; em .
They were losers .
And I &apos;ve even <unk> some of the songs , but I have no one to sing it for , and I &apos;m really good .

Yeah , or maybe you and me hop in that car of yours and do some grocery shopping ?
You know , at first , I didn &apos;t want to do it &apos; cause of the <unk> , but now it &apos;s just ... Well , to answer your question , Connie , apparently I &apos;m married to a man who thinks it &apos;s OK to <unk> an infant with steroids .

Let &apos;s do something about that <unk> .
I came to the woods because I <unk> to live <unk> , and see if I could not learn what it had to teach , and not , when I came to die , discover that I had not lived .

So I put this up .
Okay , we &apos;re at the part where he bites down on the back of my neck , so we should probably wrap this up .
Okay , Brian , I &apos;m just putting this out there , but I &apos;m a baby and only dicks don &apos;t let babies win .

Well , if there &apos;s anyone I can trust it &apos;s a stranger at the gym holding a dirty needle .
Now we can &apos;t fit through the window , but maybe there &apos;s some way we can let people know we &apos;re down here .

I planned to kill James Woods and frame Tom Tucker , <unk> <unk> the two people who cast me <unk> and ruined my life .
What ?
I &apos;m not the one who just had to post the video to Instagram that very second .
I mean , shows like <unk> <unk> are basically dramas , but they get comedy awards all the time .
You know , Anna when I first saw you , I thought you were the most beautiful girl in the world .
I ..
I like to tell stories from my life and let the <unk> flow <unk> from everyday situations .
Dad , what would you say if l told you l didn &apos;t want to be in the Scouts ?
l &apos;d say come again ?
And then l &apos;d laugh because l said &apos; &apos; come . &apos; &apos;
You all just take your shoes off , there .
Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing .
Huh .
Should I follow the <unk> into the dungeon or should I go back the way I came ?
<unk> .
In fact I wrote a new song today and I want to hear what you think of it .
We &apos;re back .
To answer your question , if you want to control <unk> , start your own TV station .
This can be a pain in the ass when you got to do it all by yourself .
Are you kidding ?
All you &apos;ve done is make fun of anybody possibly thinking I could be a model .
Joe , thank you for having us in this restaurant with a painted wall that makes <unk> look terrible .
Well , Lois , I think you did the right thing by trying to inform these kids about safe sex .
Well , as a veteran , I get to star in a viral YouTube video of me <unk> with my beloved pet .
Hey , you guys , I hate to do this to you , but I gotta get out of here .
I &apos;m just writing a letter to my boyfriend .
Dear , my boyfriend , Thank you for making out with me recently on purpose .
That was cool .
Those flowers that you totally sent me were really pretty , just like you said I am .
Love , Meg .
Did you ever <unk> the reason you &apos;re having trouble passing <unk> grade is that you &apos;re incapable of anything else ? !
I have an announcement .
Meg Griffin &apos;s plane was shot down over the Sea of <unk> .
It spun in .
There were no survivors .
But if you can &apos;t accept me now that we <unk> about certain things , then maybe you aren &apos;t the friends My mother bought it for me , and I was worried it might be a <unk> <unk> , but if you big kids like it , then it must be pretty cool .
Now here &apos;s how it would &apos;ve looked if the plane had <unk> into a school for <unk> but one <unk> had <unk> , gone home , and <unk> beat his wife .
Don &apos;t worry , Lois , we &apos;re the police , and we &apos;ll do our very best to find Brian and girl Chris .
Even if you don &apos;t believe the note was legitimate , there was an <unk> who saw the entire thing .
Okay , guys , now , I thought we could try to find the ghost by doing the movie <unk> .
Mother , as first lady of the American stage , <unk> <unk> , once said : I &apos;m going to kill you !
Okay , Tom , uh , our top story tonight : a burst water pipe in the <unk> unit of Quahog General results in the tragic drowning deaths of four children and one nurse .
Right .
I say we fight the British and drive &apos; em back to whatever country they came from .
Well , I don &apos;t pay you to think , hot lips .
In fact , I don &apos;t pay you at all .
Count it .
Don &apos;t spend any time with the first two families , make a commitment to family number three , and double down by announcing it at his <unk> father &apos;s <unk> party .
I &apos;m putting <unk> Grant and <unk> on it because they &apos;re so far from the case , they don &apos;t care about it at all .
Then I buried the body and even went out of my way to cover up the evidence .
Now nobody will have any reason to be afraid of me or think I &apos;m a pervert , and everybody can just treat me like normal again .
Okay , and , um , number three could you say , Julie , I promise to get back on my feet before the baby arrives .
Well , I mean , there &apos;s this little hole - it was kind of an <unk> choice by the <unk> - and if you shoot a laser into this hole , the station blows up .
Tell him I &apos;m a <unk> liar and that I &apos;ve been under a lot of stress because of the child rape charges I &apos;m facing .
When I heard that , I thought to myself , Why on earth don &apos;t these guys just hurry up ?
But according to the law , it is still my right to choose what I do with my body .
Oh , great , and maybe we could <unk> a <unk> and light it on fire so that it <unk> .
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s just , it &apos;s been so hard since Mom and Dad died and Joe moved in with all his big band records .
I would never ask you to do this if I had any other choice and if what were at stake was anything less than my entire way of life .
Yeah , I mean , we <unk> just sit here in the booth and crack jokes , but you &apos;re kind of a buzz kill .
She got in a car wreck , and was burned beyond <unk> , and I <unk> up on Fortnite this weekend , but you probably only care about the first two things .
Excuse me .
Now that your family is gone , would you mind if we turn on the TV ?
It &apos;s true .
I never mentioned this because I don &apos;t want him to feel bad , but after he was born , they had to <unk> most of my <unk> .
Because I know Tom Tucker could be a great actor , and I &apos;m gonna help him make it happen .
Me next , me next !
I &apos;m the dog .
I &apos;m <unk> and have a <unk> stock <unk> , but I &apos;m not above eating grass <unk> and <unk> them on the rug by the door .
I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> who will probably drop my plans for world <unk> when I grow up and fall in love with a rough trick named Jim .
Well , you know , I , I been sorta just hangin &apos; back here , takin &apos; all this in , &apos; cause I didn &apos;t think I feel awful .
We were getting along and now he hates me .
How do I get him to like me ?
Damn it , Griffin !
You &apos;ve been staring at that menu for <unk> minutes , and now you &apos;re sitting in a double pee puddle !
Well , <unk> as I may be , there is no way I &apos;m going in there for a massage .
It was my first summer staying at the shore , but I had a feeling that I , Nick The <unk> <unk> , would fit right in .
Meg , when this is over , I &apos;m putting rocks in my pockets and walking into the mall <unk> .
Excuse me .
I bought this laptop here yesterday , but when I got home I noticed the apple already had a bite taken out of it !
You know , some people think that <unk> are <unk> , but , uh , you know , I always think ... who the hell decided <unk> were so great ?
All right , I &apos;m going to send you back five minutes after we <unk> in the time machine .
Jerome , can you tell that to get the hell out of here before I kick him in the face ?
You know , they always set those things to pay out more so they can lure people into the casino .
We were just <unk> if <unk> should hook up with this guy she met a few nights ago .
Hi , everybody , we &apos;re a little <unk> for time , so we &apos;re gonna have to <unk> people right here in the hallway .
Nobody here thinks you look good unless you have big , round eyes and a tiny little nose and <unk> .
But I was thinking , maybe this afternoon you &apos;d like to borrow my credit card and buy yourself a new <unk> .
They <unk> , I guess , would be the one thing ... to take away from this part of the seminar .
Brian , when you have to go to these <unk> just to get away with smoking pot it &apos;s time to make a change .
Ha !
I said Will you be my wife ?
You said yes , so it is <unk> .
Let me touch your face .
Tomato soup , <unk> cheese , and a weak cup of tea ... is the best lunch in my book .
No , with the hole in the left butt cheek from holding it in for two hours cos it was a long church <unk> and I thought blowing gas would <unk> Jesus , so I let it go in the <unk> and it <unk> like Louis Armstrong .
I &apos;ll bet if I go upstairs to that bathroom that <unk> is as dry as a bone .
Come on , you ... You can live without a dog , Stewie , but you can &apos;t live without a father .
Uh ...
If you get a job , who &apos;s gonna feed me and protect me from the evil monkey in my closet ?
I can &apos;t make him attack you , Brian , but if I keep <unk> them , eventually one will go after you .
We did get another one yesterday , but some fat-ass blew out half the <unk> , so we put lunch on it .
Yeah , we found this note he left you .
Dear Brenda , I have decided to leave you .
I realized that you are too good for me , and you and our <unk> child would be better off without me in the picture .
Love , Jeff .
P.S.
If the cops ask , tell them that Joe , Peter and Quagmire were with you last night .
If you tell anyone otherwise , I will come back and not only hit you , but I will murder you .
And no one will care because you &apos;re garbage .
Well , I was an <unk> for a while , then I was a cowboy , and then all afternoon I was a <unk> , so it &apos;s been , uh ... it &apos;s been a long one .
Look , Peter , I didn &apos;t want to ask you to do this because of that <unk> but awesome thing you did in the battle war of the past .

White guys don &apos;t want a relationship with black <unk> they just want a <unk> on their belt .

That show is so funny .
It really reminds me of me and my friends , how we hang out before I kill them for <unk> the wrong god .
You know , Brian , before you came along I was so depressed I was planning to kill myself .
So we &apos;re all decided , our last high school play was about as gay as we wanna go .
You &apos;re probably asking yourself , Which way are they gonna go ?
Are they gonna make a <unk> <unk> joke ?
Are they gonna make an AIDS joke ?
Or are they gonna make a joke about the fact ... that his last name sounds <unk> like &apos; anus &apos; ?
There &apos;s a lot to do , so we can &apos;t be afraid to just roll up our sleeves and get the job done .
All right , if we &apos;re going to make it out alive , we got to stick together from now on .
Well , I been trying to make Chris less of a fat <unk> , and nothing seems to be working , so now we &apos;re <unk> around in giant hats .

To the beach , a wedding on the beach , beach <unk> , beach funeral , business conference which could be at a beach , a <unk> through the park , should that park be <unk> to a beach .
Let me give you a tip , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> between two points is the <unk> <unk> <unk> shot .
It &apos;s called <unk> George .
George used to be a curious monkey , but after a month in <unk> , all he did was wait for food .
The zoo people wanted him to mate , but he lost interest in that , too .
20 years and millions of dollars in zoo <unk> later , he died .

<unk> <unk> .
John <unk> only ate beef and coffee for every meal , so the director had to shoot around the fact that he was on the toilet all the time .

I &apos;m no good at talking to girls .
That &apos;s why I ran away from you .
If I &apos;m the one who made her feel this way , then I &apos;m the one who &apos;s got to fix it .
He &apos;s all I got , &apos; cause I &apos;m a young street tough , and my parents ain &apos;t so good to me .
I think that we should <unk> some people to represent us , and they should make rules and choices on our behalf .
Then <unk> is starting , and I &apos;m clearly in the cast , and I haven &apos;t been to any of the <unk> , and all the cue cards are blank , and that show is all cue cards .
Yeah ... a-and maybe she can be my new mom , you know , just like Greg <unk> and Paul <unk> were <unk> my two dads .

But , Peter , I still don &apos;t understand why you would go to all that trouble to find God and only ask about the Patriots .
In fact , I &apos;d even go so far as to say that a <unk> strip club is the most magical place in the world .
<unk> , I &apos;m trying to sell my condo , and I need people to come to the open house and talk about how nice it is .
Then you &apos;re gonna want to add the duck breasts , <unk> the bag , and <unk> that for at least one hour , or up to 24 hours , if you want to <unk> this ahead of time .

You know there &apos;s an issue facing many <unk> today that I know concerns a great number of us .

Face the circle in the square , you &apos;ll see me , I &apos;ll show you where .
And the best way to start a <unk> day of being a good citizen is with a healthy breakfast rich in <unk> and <unk> .
